Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about ‘putting like a map’
A number of Assemblies are working hard to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This terror has changed the name of Assemblies and proposed to the Wesh Parliament.
Asembly members of various political groups are afraid to face jokes about the change.
A Lebar group member says his group is concerned that "the new term is happy with Twp and Pwp"
For Welsh readers outside: Welsh, Twp's money is foolish and Pwp's money is cheap.
One Play Assembly member says they're "not happy" as a group and recommend the option.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the group saw the "open mind" change but noted that there is little difference between MWP and the scale.
In other words, the West Letter World's speech is like the U.S. U.S. speech.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently implementing the decree for the start of the rename process, said: "The members will have to decide for themselves what to do with the description of the names of Assembly members."
The government of Wells Act 2017 allows Wells Assembly to change their name.
In June, the Commission published a community result where the proposal to change the name of the assembly is supported by the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the membership of Assemblies, the Commission supports Welsh Parliamentary Member or WMP, but in general MWP has received the highest support.
Apparently, assembling members are recommending different options, but it will be difficult to reach an agreement for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is about to collect pieces of legislation within a few weeks.
This reform rule will include various changes to the way the Assembly operates, including the disability of the Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
After the debate on this rule, the Assemblies will have the opportunity to give a final vote on what their appointment should be.
Macedonians are voting in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the Republic of Northern Macedonia and rename their country.
This popular vote is organised to avoid decades of conflict with neighboring state Greece, which has its own Macedonian province.
Athens has long claimed that its neighbor's name is a symbol of the establishment of claims on their territory, and that is why the European Union and NATO have repeatedly addressed members' requests.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Jaev, believe that the change of name is only a step needed to join the European Union and NATO.
The church of Harlem is still silent.
"The ancient people I spoke to said that there was a church and a panchala at every corner of history," said Mr. Adams.
"None of it today."
He said that the problem of alcohol loss is understandable.
Currently, "human social contacts are becoming different."
"The penthouses are no longer a house of residence where everyone goes on a regular basis."
As far as the church is concerned, the money that they sell will not go as long as the leaders think, "Today and tomorrow, they will go back to where they started."
He also said that apartment buildings and condominiums could be built instead of the church, where all people who don't help the rest of the area will live.
"Most of those who buy condominiums in all these buildings will be Sethang," he said, "and so they will hurry the day of the closing of these churches because most people who come to live in the condominium are unlikely to be members of the church."
Harlem was founded by the two churches of Sethang – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and a decade later by St. Martins.
The original Sethang Methodist congregation left the church in 1930.
Close to worship takes possession of the building of a godless congregation.
Under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, a peasant congregation takes the lead in St. Martins, who is leading a boy against the sellers on A Handred and Toanty Fifty Street – a main road for Harleme Kanakatar.
The building was badly damaged in a fire accident in 1939, but the Parisians planned to rebuild it, and they planned to build the caravan.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the heir to St. Martins proudly "Hours of the Poor".
Last July, he called it something different: "a historical resource" and "an incomplete historical tradition."
According to experts, the University of Michigan's Tiffany Nyong also says that it is the most important carilon in the surrounding world of a humpback player, who played Dionio A. Lind, who was appointed to play a larger carilon by the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marywood said St. Martins didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's last few months is a complex incident of the founders and prosecutors appointed by the general leaders of the church or by the Episcopal Dioceses.
Vestry – the Paris government body, which was formed with the general leaders – expressed their concern last July that they thought that Diosice would "move costs", although Diosice's president and lawyer were not involved in the implementation of the Vestry.
Some members of Paris complained about the lack of transparency in the work of Diocese.
A 13-year-old girl in California was injured in an attack by Hungary after drowning her fists
On Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was injured in the attack of Hungary after the first day of the day of the swallowing of the shell, officials said.
The incident of the attack near Encentas occurred seven mornings ago.
Chad Hamel San Diego's KWB TV tells her that she spent about half an hour listening to the boy's cry for help on Saturday mornings with her friends and that she was able to paddle with a group of people to get her out of the water.
Hamel says, first he thought that the boy was snorkeling to catch a snake, but then "you can understand that the boy was saying, 'I'm stoned!'
'He has stoned me!'
Her throat was broken," Hamel says she can see the boy.
"I'm afraid to get out of the water for everyone: 'There's sharks in the water!' Hamel adds.
The child is being sent to the Ady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in a serious condition.
The attacker’s population was not known.
A few weeks ago, a Hungarian presence appeared in the area, but it was not known as a dangerous population.
Giles also says that the injured person has been seriously injured at the top of his lap.
Officials banned access to the site from the Poto Beach of Casablanca to the Soyama of Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles reports that there are more than 135 people in Hungary, most of whom are not dangerous.
Sansbaris is planning to enter the U.S. market
Sensbaris Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams are going to compete in the department store's studios with a wide range of visuals and special assistance companies.
As part of the UK's 2.8 billion pounds of imagery market, these large imagery islands will be launched in 11 countries and will be launched as a success in other markets, where the United Kingdom's imagery market is growing where fashion and home decor goods are sold.
This investment comes to the picture as the supermarkets are once looking for new ways to fill up the layers with TV, microwave and household decor.
Sensbaris said it would double the amount of its imagery into 300 items, with revolutions, IGs, Tweizermans and Doctors for the first time.
The extensive ranges of liberals, mabelins and barts will already have a place where brands such as Butts will have different places for shops.
The supermarket launches its retail makeup range to make most of the food Vigan Friendly – which has become very popular among young Croatians.
On the other hand, the Perfum seller will run a product distribution test at the two Sansbaris stores, the first of which was launched last week in South London, and the second part of this year will be launched at the Bermingham Shell.
Buying a small amount of food online and local fashion stores means that supermarkets are trying to make more money for the Croatian community.
Mike Coup, head of Sansbaris, said that the outlets should look like a department store because the supermarket chain is competing with a sales store like Aldi and Lidel and it will have more services and food-free.
Two years ago, Sansbaris has been sitting in an Argos outlet in a hundred hundred shops since buying Argos and Hobbits Chains, and has opened up a few Habitats, which have increased the sales of Modi food and made the acquisition even more beneficial.
The pre-ordering of the supermarket and the firmesi division failed.
Sansbaris 2000 examined a joint project with Fik Boots, but the project was closed because of the fact that the profits from the Chemist shop would be left out because of the conflict.
Sansbaris is planning this new scheme after the owner of his 281 stores owned by Leeds Farmes is selling it to Celesio.
The company said that by adding a pooled range of Skincare Brands, the Leds would play a role in the project, including La Rosse Posei and Vissi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial manager of Sensbaris, said: "We have changed our wings to improve the environment for our creditors.
We have also invested especially in trained employees who will be present to advise.
Our brand ranges are designed to meet all kinds of needs, and because of the attractive environment and convenient location, we have now become a dependable figure which will challenge the old ways of kanakatar."
Holly Willoughby withdraws 11 million pounds from the share of Peter Jones 'Fireworks'
To focus on his new deal with Holly Willoby Marx and Spencer and ITV, Dragans Dan's star Peter Jones' lifestyle brand is "fire" in Peter Jones' anger to cancel the deal.
There's no time in Willobby's hand for their home supplies and follow-up brand truly.
This pair is compared to the Gyneth Palmtro Gup brand.
This morning's representative, 37, reported his departure.
Holly Wilobby Dragons' star named Dan angered Peter Jones by reversing their attractive lifestyle brand at the last minute – focusing on his new venture with Marx and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones Reyes became "fired" when a TV girl admitted that she had no time for her new share – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – in an interview at the office of his commercial empire in Bakinghamshire on Tuesday.
The business was compared to the Güpp brand of Gineth Paltro and was expected to double the amount of 11 million pounds of Willobir.
Willoby, 37, after reporting his departure from Truly in Instagram, Jones left Britain on the jet to live on his holiday.
One source states: "Trully has been on the top of the list of oil priorities so far.
It was part of his long-term future plan that would address his financial needs for the next few decades.
His decision to withdraw has surprised everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, the project was about to start very soon.
There's a shitload of food in the Marlo's office that's ready for sale."
Experts believe that the presence of Des Marning, one of Britain's most reliable stars, could cause damage to the company's millions of pounds because they have already invested a lot of food, such as carpets, clothing and household items, from the beginning of the show, and that it will be added to the potential damage.
And it can leave a long-term friendship.
The mother of three children Willoby and her husband, Dan Ballwin, had been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap.
Willoughby started with Cap in 2016 and joined Jones on March 52 as chairman.
There are 40 percent of Zones' shares in the TV company of Baldwin on holiday in Jugeldby.
Willoby AMANDS will be brand ambassadors and ITV will replace Aunt McPartlin as the representative of the Celibrite event.
Jones' close friend said last night, "We're not going to comment on his business lunch."
Complex discussion 'and we'll fall in love after'
He scoffed at the positive attitude he had towards North Korea's leader and after making a comment that some people would think was "an ultra-presidential."
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his Mexican "Reporter" voice.
"I didn't give up."
He said he was interested in meeting Kim the second time after his first meeting in Singapore in June, and Trump called for a huge step towards evisceration of his first meeting in North Korea.
But the peace dialogue has stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore conference, North Korea's top political leader, Rey Yong Ho, announced to the world leaders at the general session of the United Nations on Saturday that North Korea could not see any "related reaction" to the previous phase of disarmament in the United States.
While, he says, the U.S. ban has continued to apply.
Trump expressed more positive views during his talks in Ali.
"We're in a good position with North Korea," he said.
"We were facing a war with North Korea.
Ten million people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He claims that Kim's efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have led to positive results – which have resulted in the completion of the rocket test, the release of prisoners, and the return of the rest of the American workers to the country.
And he supported the unusual mood to talk about Kim.
"It was very easy to act as president, but this famous woman was standing outside 10,000 people in Erina, and instead of trying to get in here, there were only 200 people standing here," Trump pointed out with his hands for the company to be right in front of her.
In Indonesia, tsunamis and earthquakes killed hundreds of people.
After the earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombak's people were displaced, no national disaster was announced, a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is challenging," Mr. Sambang said.
Although Sev is gathering a group to go to the Children's Palace, foreign workers are still not sure if they can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, head of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation of peace in order to determine whether foreign organisations will be allowed to participate immediately.
Despite the regular earthquake in Indonesia, the country is not prepared to deal with this kind of anger.
Although the Sunami Refugee Centre has been built, it has been found in other maritime areas.
Despite the alarming state, the apparent lack of tsunami alerts in Palu may have affected life after death.
When the weather is very good, many islands in Indonesia are challenging.
Natural disaster communication has been even more counterproductive.
A ship assigned to the Lomb to flee to the hospital for the destruction of the victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia has put the development of the giant infrastructure at the heart of his campaign and has invested a great deal of money in road and rail construction.
But the lack of investment before the next year's re-election has caught Mr. Jokor's government.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the long-term social tension in Indonesia, where Muslim leaders have adopted more conservative ways of life.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were killed in the riots between Christians and Muslims, and two groups were killed in the streets with guns, guns, and other firearms.

The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami has increased to 832
Indonesia's earthquakes and tsunamis have reached 832, the country's disaster management organisation announced on Sunday morning.
Many people have been reported to have been trapped in the destruction of the 7.5 earthquake building, which caused damage last Friday and 20 feet high waterfall, and also reported to Sutopo Puro Nugraho at a conference.

Police suspect arrested a 32-year-old man in the case of the murder of a woman in Shuriakagha
This morning, a woman's murder investigation was launched after the rescue of a woman in Barkenhead's Mercedes.
A 44-year-old woman killed in Smurikaga is found at the Gracen Street Mouse at 7 a.m., a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police have invited the people of the area to visit them when they see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: 'The investigation is at an early stage, but I'm asking anyone around Barkenhead who can see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I'm asking everyone, especially taxi drivers, who can have any footage in the Dash Camera, to contact us because they may have the necessary information for our investigation."
A spokesperson for the police confirmed that the people of the murdered woman Barkenhead and her body were found inside a house.
Friends today, who think this woman is familiar with them, ask where the woman's body was found this morning.
Investigations are under way and the police have reported that they are trying to report this to women's neighbors.
When a taxi driver in the Gracen Mouse tried to get into his flat, the police told him that no one was allowed to enter the building or leave the building.
He's scared to hear about it.
The residents of the building are told that it will take a few more hours to get them inside.
A police officer has been told to tell a man that the entire area is being taken as a crime scene.
At the event, a woman is in a state of shock.
He said, "The paper is so sad."
At 2:00 p.m., two vans were inside the barricade and another van was outside the barricade.
Within the barricade, a group of police officers were monitoring the fleets.
If anyone has any information, he is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC directly or to call in 101 or to call on 8800,555,11, on September 30, 277.
The new victim of the division of the parliament's Chromewell image with a 'history review'
His religious sectarian followers will be able to remove this image after the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious signs.
But Cromwell Societies announced Mr. Creek's advice as "depression" and "a history effort".
Cromwell Society Speaker John Goldsmith said: "It was necessary to mark the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace in the current resolution of the removal of the image.
It was not edited by the Order of Chromewell for the iconclamation or sign destruction of the English House of War.
In the previous century, his previous tomash will be decomposed by the wrong chromosome image.
Sir William Hamo Thornicroft's extraordinary image of the chromewell is a 19th-century view and a historical feature that many people consider worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sande Telegraft: "Many people consider Cromwell to be the defender of the parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the Kingdom – which was now accepted by a few people, but was accepted by many in the 19th century.
But it's not a complete picture of that time. It's part of the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is, the 17th-century conflict has shaped our nation's next development and Chromewell is a well-known character that represents one of the sides of this category.
The Lord's Protector is worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Killed by the Swine Chinese Farmer
According to a local news report, a South-West China market attacked a sour farmer.
A report from South China's South China Morning Post reported that the person, who has only been identified as "Yuan" as his son-in-law, is found near a sugar market in the southern tip of the Chinese province of Guijo.
A sugar farmer in China’s China Shining on May 30, 2005 is preparing sugars for a sugar farm.
He came to the market from nearby Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 sugars.
The next morning, his brother-in-law drank him dead and saw him opening the door of a neighbor's basement.
He said there was a big man in Astabala who had blood on his face.
A forensic test confirms that the soil of 550 pounds has attacked the farmer, reports the report.
"My mother's feet were bleeding and injured," said Fupato, who was identified as the "U" branch, quoted Guiang Evening News as saying.
The security camera's footage shows that Yuan is entering the market to feed his sugars in 4 to 40 minutes on Thursday.
About an hour later, his body will be found.
The soul that kills the man is not the man or his brother.
A manager of the market told Evening News that the police were collecting ammunition at the scene and that the ashes were kept locked apart so that they could not attack anyone else.
The Yuan family and the trade authorities are discussing to determine the amount of damage to his death.
Although poor, there has already been an attack on the people of the land.
In 2016, a woman in Massachusetts attacked her husband with a lump in their shed so that the man could be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a six hundred and fifty pounds of sugar put Exgen Welsh farmer under pressure in his tractor until his wife came and scared the sugar.
In 2012, after a farmer in Oregon had eaten his soup, a Montenegrin farmer told CBC news that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but can act as a "triger or thriller" for the taste of blood.
"They're just haters.
They're making small cuts, very interesting animals... but they're not trying to hurt anyone.
But you need to understand them enough," he said.
The rest of Harikan Roses will create heavy rains in the southwestern United States
According to the forecast, the storm is weakening during the colder waters of northern Mexico's Harikan Rosa.
Although in the days ahead, there will be heavy rains on Mexico's northern and southwestern United States as a result of the rose.
Today, on Sunday morning, Sunday morning, Rosa was a category of 1 harikan whose speed was 85 miles an hour, and Mexico’s Punta Uginia was 385 miles south-west.
It's about going to Rosar's north on Sunday.
On the other hand, the Pacific has begun to scale a system and is heading east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa Baha California will be hit as a storm and will lead to a deep-seated heat in the north-west towards the United States.
There will be a rain of up to 10 inches in various parts of Mexico on Monday due to roses.
Then, along with the system of deep-seated heat, the south-west will create heavy rains in the days ahead.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of rain would create a dangerous flash flood or accidental rainstorms, a flood of destruction, and possible earthquakes in the landscape
Because of its depth, rain may reach between 2 and 3 inches per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
There is a possibility of raining up to 2 to 4 inches in various parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Fluid fluiding and a very fast situation can be disrupted due to the bursting of the current.
It'll be a stupid thing to get out of the desert in the face of the threat of floods.
Heavy rains can make the canyons a terrible river, and there will be heavy floods with dust.
Local heavy rains will occur in various parts of southern California.
The amount of rain may be up to half an inch that can cause the gorges to form a small stream of destruction in the streets.
It will be the first rain of the region in the rainy weather.
On Sunday night and Monday morning may be some fragmented torrential rains in Arizona, then the rain will rise and spread from Monday night to Tuesday throughout the area.
This heavy rain will arrive at the Four Corners on Tuesday and run until Wednesday.
In October, some extreme temperature changes can be seen in the various regions of the United States, as the Arctic is colder, but the current temperature is still warmer.
This will sometimes show dramatic changes in temperature in the short distance.
A fine example of the dramatic change in temperature in the middle of the United States is shown on Sunday.
Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Das Mins, show a difference of almost 20 degrees in temperature.
The next few days will try to increase and expand the heat of the summer.
In the middle of the United States and most of the eastern regions of the United States, October begins, where temperatures range from the south-east to the north-east.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that in the first half of October, the average temperature of the United States is likely to be higher than the average.
Brett Cavern's hearing saw more than 20 million people.
Christine Blazi Ford, the Supreme Court's elected Bret Cavena and accused of sexual assault, which took place in the late 1980s, saw more than 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday.
On the other hand, political opposition continues, due to the excellent last minute of Friday, broadcasters have suspended regular events: an agreement made by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona that will take a week to investigate FBI charges.
Ford's Senate Judiciary Committee tells him that he's 100% sure that Kavana hands him in a high school party and tries to open his clothes.
Cavana said in a sensitive witness that she was 100% sure that the incident had not happened.
Nilsen's report may have seen more than 20.4 million viewers on Friday.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC accounted for the average viewers.
Other networks that broadcast the program were not available with viewers, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks.
And Nielsen usually has a problem with the quality of visitors sitting in the office.
The number of players in the program was equal to the number of football games off or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, which said the event's representatives strongly supported Cavenar's nomination, has attracted the highest number of viewers across the network throughout the day, with an average of 5.69 million, Nilsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
With CBS seeing 3.1 million, NBC seeing 2.94 million, MSNBC seeing 2.89 million and CNN seeing 2.52 million, Nilsen reported.
After listening, there was still a lot of interest.
Flake was in the center of today's show.
He will vote in favour of Cavana after the Republic's office announces his statement, and he will be arrested on Friday morning at CNN and CBS, when he rides to the hearing room of the Judician committee and the protesters shout for him.
He stood in the face of protestors for a few minutes, which broadcasts CNN directly.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think Kavana is telling the truth to the country?
He's said, "You have the power when many women are in trouble."
Flake said his office had made a statement and said before the elevator was shut down there was something else to say in the committee's hearing.
Later, when the Judical Committee votes for the vote of the entire Senate, all cable and broadcasting networks are broadcast directly.
But Flake says he will vote on this condition that the FBI will investigate charges against the elected person next week, whose request was made by few democrats.
His conversation with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Kun, has affected him in part since he was a member of the Flek.
After talking to the Kun, Flek talks to several more senators and is made up of his decision.
Flek's decision was slow, because it was clear that the Republican had no vote to approve the Cavena except for the investigation.
The president has launched an FBI investigation on the basis of charges against the Trump Cave.
British Prime Minister Mei criticised Braxit of the 'Political Games' game
In an interview with the Sande Times, Prime Minister Teresa May of the European Union accused British critics of abandoning her plan to ignore the future of the 'political game' and the nation's selfishness.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May attended the Conservative Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
On the first page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson Brexit continued his review of the so-called Checkers' plan for May, saying that Britain and the European Union are "completely wrong" to collect each other's empires.
Wade Sims Shooting: Police arrested suspect Daton Simpson in the death of the LSU player
The LSU's 20-year-old basketball player Wade Sims was arrested by the police for shooting a suspect.
Twenty-year-old Daton Simpson was arrested for murder in the second grade, Baton Red Police reported.
The authorities published video of the partition between Sims and Simpson and the police reported that his glasses were lost during Sims Maramari's time.
The police recovered the mirror from the incident and reported that the Simpson DNA was found in the glasses, CBS's associate WAFB reported in a report.
After killing Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to The Advocate's report, his Jamin is set at $350,000.
The office of the investigator of the Eastern Baton Rose area released an initial report on Friday to indicate the injury to the head and neck of the shooting.
The Louisiana State Police Relapse Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the local population are supporting investigations that can lead to the arrest of Asma.
Athletic Director Joe Aleva of LSU thanked the law enforcement agency for its "Failure of Efforts and Establishment of Justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches high, this forward baton grew in red, where her father played basketball with Wayne and LSU.
In the past, he scored 5.6 points per game and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, the LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "suffering" and "horrific" in Wade's death.
"It's a matter of concern for all time," Wade says.
Firefighting in Mexico City
Popocatepelt from Agnegiri reached the southern region of the capital of Mexico.
The increase in gas mouth activity and the increase in gas and air emissions in 24 hours have led to 183 national disasters, warning people in Mexico to stay away from the fire on Saturday.
The center was monitoring multiple gorges and thunderstorms.
Photo by social contact shows that the traffic lights in the vehicle's windshield have been read in areas like Josimilco in Mexico City.
A 7.1 earthquake that struck Mexico in September 2017 marked an increase in the firefighting activity since a 7.1 earthquake, which is only 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital.
The firehouse known as "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
In front of the anniversary of the independence vote, Catalan police clashes with disbanders
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in the attack against the Wright police with supporters of the freedom of expression, while they joined the protestors for the first year of the vote, which creates confusion among people.
A group of muslims beat them to the face of the disbanding police for them, and tossed the powder of color, causing black clouds on the street that usually fill the tourist community.
The next day, Maramario is on the scene, using the police to stop.
For a few hours, freedomists "will not forget, forgive not" were faced by the slogans of the slogan "Spin Longevity".
14 people are being treated for minor injuries due to protests, reports the local media.
After the vote on October 1st of the separation of Catalans, Madrid Beini has been a source of excitement in the area of freedom of thought.
The majority of the voters voted for freedom, although the number of votes was low because most of the people voted against separation.
According to information provided by the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed in the deadly police fight during the vote that was held in the region last year.
Freedomists were on the street all night Friday to prevent the demonstration against the national police.
Protesters continue their activities but are forced to go to different streets.
68-year-old Narcissus Termis, who was a power activist with his wife who participated in the disunity protests, said he is no longer hopeful about the freedom of Catalonia.
"Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I've seen my father come water in my mother's eyes to vote, but now we're trapped," he said.
Despite the important but difficult victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence groups have fought to maintain their momentum, where many of their well-known leaders are waiting for a vote of vote and the subsequent declaration of independence for the role of their organization to be released or arrested.

Menger's goal against the Rangers is to win between 1 and 0 of Livingstone's.
Livingston guarantees Dolly Menger's first round of victory.
Steven Gerard won the second victory in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrex Club, founded by the award-winning Livingstone Rangers.
The Dolly Menger has created a gap as Gary Holt's team has made a second round with the hibernians.
As a result, Gerard's team left the premiership without winning any airships, and on Sunday, they will face the hearts of those who have gone beyond eight points.
Earlier, on Thursday, the European League will welcome the Epid of Rangers to Vienna.
Livingston, the race for their defeat in the division has already increased by six, but the main Cooch Holt was still unable to enjoy the victory in place of Kenya last month.
Livingstone misses a number of chances against their unrelenting opponents.
They should have moved on long before the Holt team was rounded up, because their aggressive attitude created all kinds of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson's defense continues but fails to achieve his efforts, so Alan Lithgo can only run his effort wide after sliding to meet the Craig Hulket's head.
Hosts were allowed to play the Rangers in front of them, knowing that the guests might be in danger.
And that's where the important goal came from.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and opened a Livingston Ball account, which came together to set up Declan Galagar and Robinson Menga, which rolled from the center of a box.
At this stage, the rangers had authority, but they knew the defence of the volunteers as a difference, and the leader Liam Kali has been making a distinction for most of the time.
The series continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morlos stopped a shot of Kali.
Scott Pittman was shot at by Rangers' goalkeeper Alan McGrigo and won another set of pizzas from Lithago Way.
The cruises continued to come into the Livingston Box and continued to be cleared, even though the two panels - alternative Glen Middleton had been repaired after the challenge and for handball.
‘ Unbelievable ’ Kirty Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lambont Tony McCarney Arena, BBC Scotland
A great performance and performance for Livingstone.
To someone, they were poor, they continued to give up hope for everyone at their high speed.
After returning to the top level, their game types and players have changed very little, but since they have to go to the lobby for the way he has united the group.
He had a lot of bosses.
Captain Halcket was amazing, created a poorly organized defense, and kept Manga Cone Goldson and Joe Warle always safe.
Even though the rangers were less inspired.
They've lost the same value as they did under Gerard.
They missed the final ball - only once they opened the guests - and this is a warning for the Rangers, who are now at the table.
Mixture added in the Erdogan Colon
On Saturday (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were delighted to meet for Brexit in Berlin.
This is the last day of the German trip to President Erdogan's debate - which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO team members.
They debate the issues of human rights, freedom of the press and participation in the EU of Turkey.
Erdogan then travels to Cologne for the establishment of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have protected 25,000 people from joining the mosques, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of opposition protesters - many of whom were Kurdians - heard their voice condemning the two of them for welcoming him to the country in his policy and in Germany.
The protest is proof that a spectator is praised by the German Turks as a goat and condemned by others as a ruler.

Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the riot.
Six high-security officers have been injured in a riot in a man's prison, the Prime Minister's office has reported.
On Sunday morning, at 9:00 a.m., HMP Long Lartin of the Orchestra is spreading and it's going on.
There are eight prisoners in a branch of the "Tornedo" specialty in the conflict.

A spokesperson for the Privy Service said: "A particularly trained prison activist has been mobilized to face an incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff have been tested for rape
We don't tolerate violence in our prison, and it's clear that the criminals will be taken under the law and they'll spend a long time behind the prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 5 percent of the country's dangerous criminals
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator went to the hospital after being affected by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a major riot of the Wright officers was called to prison where the workers were attacked by force.
Harikan Roza Phoenix, Las Vegas, Saltlake City is threatening the skyscraper.
There has been an accident in Arizona, Greece, but it seems to be the first time in the week that Harikan Roza South-West will be exposed to the threat of natural rain during the rest of its power throughout the Mediterranean.
For the time being, West Arizona and East Nevada, Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and South East California and UTA have launched Flash Flow Watch in the cities of Saltlake City.
It is hoped that the rain will reach the end of Monday, directly and on Tuesday.
In a tweet by the National Climate Director of Phoenix, only "the 10-year-old storms have remained in the summer of Phoenix for 200 miles since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Jed border."
The latest model of the Harikan Centre predicts rains up to 2-4 inches, with Arizona moving in the rim, which may be up to 6 inches apart.
In other parts of the South-West East, with Central Rockies and Great Basin, there is the possibility of raining up to 1 to 2 inches, which can be up to 4 inches apart.
The daily rain can be a blessing for people who are at risk because the areas are devastated
Although there is a very serious concern about the forest, it is likely that this rain will be of benefit to the south-west.
According to U.S. estimates, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's total salary is being spent, which is the second highest category of weather.
First, Harikan Rozza's path will be flooded by the Gulf of Mexico's California subsoil.
Roza, still a powerful Harricane, is moving from Ponta Eugenia to South 385 and to North 12 miles every hour on Sunday morning.
The storm is driving cold water into the Pacific.
So, on Monday afternoon or at night, the summer storm is expected to collapse in Mexico.
Mexico may have heavy rainfall, which poses a significant risk to the forest.
"From Baja California there is a chance of rain to 10 inches in the north-west Sonora"
Roza will travel north across Mexico as a low-sense summer before arriving at Arizona on Tuesday morning and enter the South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The expected main danger since the end of Roza is the heavy rains of Baja California, the North West Sonora and the South West East of the United States," according to the National Harican Center.
The rainfall can cause deadly natural and destructive floods and floods in the desert and can cause earthquakes in the eastern part of the country.

Trump said that the Kavana Democratic Party was called 'disgusting, angry'
"At a meeting in West Virginia, Trump said, "A vote on behalf of Judge Cavenar to reject a fair and cruel democratic party,"
Trump says that Kavana has been called the 'disgusting, angry' of the Democratic Party through her nomination process.
Kavanh testified before the Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the claim of Christian Blaci Ford that he had been subjected to sexual abuse a few decades ago in his teens.
Ford also testified to hearing about his allegations.
President Saturday said that "the American people saw Kavanho's remarkable qualities and courage on that day."
For Western Virginia supporters, he said that a vote on the part of Jaz Kavanh will be a vote to protect a lawyer with public starling records, the most successful element of our time."
In the middle of the elections, the president clearly acknowledged the appointment of Cavenar as a representative of the importance of the Republican vote.
"From one of the most important choices in our lives, only five weeks away.
Although I don't take part, I do take part," he said.
"That's why I'm always trying to fight for poor candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats are on the "resistance and prevention" mission.
It is not expected that the Senate's first main presidential vote on the election of the Cave will follow Friday, a former partner of the JOPI leadership told CNN.
In Indonesia's earthquake, hundreds of deaths in tsunamis, there is a sharp rise.
At the time of a major earthquake and tsunami in the island of Sulaoc, Indonesia, some 384 people were killed and many said they were in the stream on Saturday.
A few thousand people were gathered in the city of Palu on Friday for a celebration at the seaside when six meters (18 feet) of the night broke up in the high valley, which drove many to their death and destroyed everything on the road."
Sunami comes after an earthquake of 7.5.
"People continued their activities at sea in the face of yesterday's threats, and those who could not run immediately and became victims of it," said a briefing in Nugroho Jakarta, a spokesperson of the BNPB disaster in Indonesia.
"Sunami didn't come from itself, it took a car, a log, a house, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho added, "Sunami traveled 800 kilometres (477) in an open sea at an hour before it hit the ground.
Some people got out of the tsunami and they got away with it.
Nearly 1,700 people have been removed from the center of the city.
Pictures showing that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, the walls have been turned and broken, and a mosque has collapsed in the water.
The aftershocks continue to burn in the suburban town on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt by 2.4 million people in an area filled with people.
In a statement by the Indonesian Agency for the Assement and Application (BPIT), the power released by the Great Earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 qualities in the heroism of the Second World War.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of the seabed, can increase the size of the tsunami
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" that a few thousand homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have broken down.
Some of the affected buildings have been found to be trapped under the destruction of the building, and he also says that there are 540 injured and 29 missing."
Nugroho reported that the incident and damage of the earthquake in a region near the center of the earthquake may be even more serious in the north of Palu.
The communications said, "It was completely pangu without any information."
More than 300,000 people live there, "Red Cross has made a statement, and added that workers and volunteers are going to a damaged area."
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse."
Sunami Palu was widely criticized for not providing this information on Saturday, although officials said that the noises had come when the alarm went off.
A person on the top of the building on the floor of a cupboard shared in the social media has been alerted to the warning on the street below.
In a few minutes, a tidal current of water was pushed into the ground and swept through buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the result immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami have resulted in a power failure that disconnects communications around the world and makes it difficult for authorities to recover quickly.
The military forces, with the help of Jakarta and other cities, started sending Kargo Plans, the authorities said the rescuers now need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been relaunched for rescue and will be closed for the ordinary by October.
President Joko Widodor was about to visit the refugee centres on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the number of deaths in tsunamis has risen to 800.
It's a terrible thing.
According to Mr. Dossever, when the workers of the world's organizations were moving safely from Dungala to Palu, where workers took refuge in their offices, they saw the picture of destruction on the road.
Doseba also says, "They've seen many houses destroyed there."
It's a pity.
Even when the relief teams began the disaster relief program, some complained that a lot of foreign aid workers were being banned from travel.
Indonesian lawmakers, economists from abroad, food suppliers and workers will be able to come when a disaster is declared as a national disaster area.
But it hasn't been announced yet.
Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Ariani said, "It's still a country-wide disaster."
"If once the government says yes, it's a national disaster," we can start international aid, but there's still no announcement.
On Friday, the second night of the tsunami strike in Palu, friends and family of the homeless expect a miraculous event that will bring them light to the end of a natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy is taken from the nordama.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been nailed to her mother's body for two days.
The Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Xendon Subandono trained the two Asian Games Paragliders, who are now searching for what took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Mr. Mendagi also said that those who had been arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel were students.
He also said, "I'm responsible for my feelings as a leader in the paragliding field."
Mr. Jendon recalled how Roa Roya Hotel had spread to the paragliding community just hours after the news that it had been destroyed, he had been backing up and spreading it through the Watsoap message to the Palu contestants who had participated in a festival in the Gulf of the Sea.
Although he did not read his message, he did not read it.
He said, "The message has not been sent."
The thieves stole $26,750 when they returned to the M.M. machine in Liv's newport.
A news report from the Newport Police department reported that on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 while the British workers kept money on MM.
The car driver was emptying his M.M.'s money in the entertainment complex and ready to give more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy at a news conference.
While he was working, he ran behind a Brinks worker and ran away with a bag full of money that was designed for handcuffs.
According to the news report, the supervisor has seen many suspects run away, but the police have not yet identified the number of people involved.
If anyone can identify these people, their newport police are asked to contact 859-292-3680.
Cain West: This apper changed his name.
Ro Apper Cain West has changed his name.
In his announcement of this change, he wrote on Saturday on Twitter: "The officially known Cain West."
West, 41, was also known for a long time as Yee and he used the name as his property.
His presence in Satard's Night Life was revealed before, where he hoped to discover his new album Yandi.
The event was replaced by the singer Ariana Grandede, who cancelled the event "for emotional reasons".
The West has already said that the word is religious, in addition to the short name of his current professional.
At the beginning of the West Year, radio performer Big Boy said when discussing the title of album, "I believe that 'Ye' is the most used word of the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'.
"Here I am you, I am us, this is us.
Cain says, which means the only person, is to reflect our good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects our identity more."
He's one of several famous apparitions who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known in various ways as P.D., P.D., or D.D., but this year he announced that he prefers the name of the recipient and the name of the brother.
A former partner in the West worked with J.G., and Hyphen, Hyphen, and the capital.
Mexico's MML has sworn not to use military forces against ordinary people.
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel Lopez, has sworn to the 50th anniversary of the bloody persecution against students that he will not use military force against citizens.
Lopez Abrado vowed on Saturday at Tolateloco Plaza that "Do not use military force for the persecution of Mexicans."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at peaceful protests that killed 300 people while the left-wing student movement in Latin America was building its own strong position.
Lopez Abrado apologized to young Mexicans by helping to set up a monthly school and a more governmental school.
He said the lack of opportunities for youth unemployment and education drew young people to a crime alliance.
The United States should pay double fees for its expertise.
As China has become more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S.A. and should double the amount of expenditure in research, says expert intelligence researcher and investor Kai-fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This statement came from various parts of the government, the U.S.A. announced that the U.S. has an official intellectual failure.
China has already launched their new plan last year: its goal is to achieve 1 place in the development of artificial intelligence in 2030.
Lee also said, "Two-way research projects will be a good start where most countries are far behind and we are looking for further steps in the progress of skill."
Double-table U.S.A. could double the chances of gaining great skill, this week, in an interview given by CNB, Lee said.
Lee, whose book "All Superpowers : 'China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order' this month, is the lead executive of Huton Miflyn Harcourt, Sinovez Venzer, who has invested in China's most top professional intelligence organization Facebook++.
In the 1980s, the University of Carnegie Melon worked in a specialized intelligence system that defeated the top-ranked American player and was the founder of Microsoft Research and a Chinese member of the Google branch.
The former US government technology competition, like the Robotics Challenge of the Agency's Advanced Research Project, has acknowledged the next steps to be taken.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win a government grant, Lee said.
"China does not remove academic leaders; corporates are giving," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology agencies have appointed scholars from universities to work in skilled intelligence.
Lee says that changes in immigration policies can help increase the U.S. I.I. efforts.
"I think the Green Card should be offered to PSD automatically," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched its next generation of intelligent development plans.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to US researchers, such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, but there is little academic value for work, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has set up a joint expert research centre, which has the funding of the arts and educators involved, and announced the election committee on the White House's expertise.
And this month, DRPI announced $2 billion of investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law did not see any progress within a few months in trying to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in favour of whether to rename the country
A referendum on whether to hold the "Republic of Northern Macedonia" voted on Sunday to change the name of the Macedonian people, a step that would resolve a decade-old conflict with Greece that prevented the European Union and NATO from seeking membership.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, is the name of its northern neighbour, representing a claim to its land and vetoing the entry of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments have agreed on a new name proposed in June, but nationalist opponents believe that this change will undermine the national identity of the Macedonian majority.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the vote and doubted whether the Turnout vote required at least 50 per cent to be valid in the ban.
The question at the referendum was: "You are in favour of NATO and members of the European Union, with agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name with Prime Minister Zoran Jaev have expressed their support for the European Union and NATO contribution to the fall of Yugoslavia to one of the countries in Macedonia.
"I am here today for the future of the country, to vote for young people in Macedonia so that they can live independently of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," 79-year-old Olivers said in Skopje.
However, enough members of parliament have said that they will follow the result of the vote through decision-making.
The Parliament needs two-thirds majority to change its name.
The Kingdom Election Commission said there was no news of Nagad Anyom on Wednesday.
However, 34 per cent of the 2016 national parliament elections only voted 16 per cent, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said José Tenevski, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Jaev, his wife Jorica and his son Dushko voted to change the country's name for the referendum in Macedonia, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join Macedonia on September 30th, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and chaired the setting of those who voted to vote.
"We are on the side of NATO and the European Union, but we do not want to join the service door, "Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to be our Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia setting."
Prime Minister Jayev said NATO members will make the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe it will be a huge majority because more than 80 percent of our citizens are European Union and NATO," Jaev said after giving his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "confirmation of the future."
The Macedonian Institute for Police Research said last Monday that 30 to 43 per cent of the votes required for the tournament will take part in the vote.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia shows that 57 per cent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent said they would vote.
The vote must be more than 50% in order to be successful.
The failure to vote last May will represent the first fatal blow to the Western government since it took power.
See: Go into the entire British defence for Sargio Aguareo in Manchester City
In the history of Manchester, England, over a period of between 2 and 0 in the Saturday state of Manchester, Joe Briton defensed Sargio Aguaero and Rome Sterling.
Aguaro made it easy to see his score in the last 65 minutes.
At the beginning of the sequence, Argentine striker found a passage in midfield.
Before going to open ground, he ran through three British defenders.
Aguaro was then surrounded by four green Jerseys.
He turned around a defender before leaving several more people on the edge of the British box.
Then he pushed a pass to the left to find the starling.
Using his first touch box, the English foreword returned the ball to Aguareo, who defeated British protector Matthew Ryan and shot his right arm at the right side of the valley.
"Aguaro is struggling with some problems at his feet," the City Manager told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he made a hole at the moment."
However, Starlingi Sky Blog provided the first opportunity for the first battle of the Prime League.
That round came in 29 minutes.
Aguaro got the ball deep in the Briton area.
He sent Lira Sen to the left with a nice route.
Sen took a few toes before taking Starling to the remote post office.
The ball tapped the net just before Sky Blue Forward.
The City Championships League will fight with Hophenheim at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday in the German Sinshim Rain-Neker-Arena.
The name of the player wants to play the Rakis game
After removing the Nationals from the playoff debate, there was no reason to force anyone else to start.
However, Shire hopes that he will take a stand against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the playoffs against the L.A.L.A.D.'s leadership against the W.G.R.R.
On Friday night, Rockis won the Wild Card between 5-2 against the Nationals, but they still want to get their first division title.
"If we don't play for anything, at least we can get a shave on the audience of Denver that Dad and the other group may know at the top of any points I'm facing this year.
Why don't I want to compete in it?"
Nationals has not yet been able to announce a starter for Sunday, but it is reported that the Sharger can be beaten in such a situation.
Sherger, who will start his 34th time, released a bullpen session on Thursday and piss on his usual restaurant on Sunday.
Washington's right hand was 18-7, with 2.33 IRs and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inches.
Tromp meeting in West Virginia
In the middle election, the president strongly mentioned Bret Cavena, who was elected to his Supreme Court in the situation around the Republican poll.
"All we've done is in danger of November.
Five weeks away from the most important choices in our life.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I've been across all places to fight for the poor candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible legal group of your democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to use any means necessary to regain power, you see this lowness, dignity.
Whom do they hurt, and whom do they have to follow in order to gain power and control, and who do not give up, they only want power and control, and we will not give it to them."
He said the democrats are on the "resistance and prevention" mission.
"And you've seen it over the past four days," he says, calling the Democrats "disgraced and angry and worthless and unfaithful."
He called the Democratic Senator Diane Finnstein of the Senate's Justice Committee, who received high-ranking tweets from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you lost the argument?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Leber is no longer a free organization.
It's not like those who say what's in their mouth.
When the members of the Momentum party in my area blamed me and voted, it was not surprising.
Because your heart will not welcome the habit of speaking here - I was the last lebar in the list to tell you.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan had a similar attitude because she was firmly opposed to Jewish religion.
For me, it was my fault that I had to deal with Jeremy Karbin.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, Europe and national security, and similar issues, which Jeremy did not even agree with previous leaders.
On Friday, Ntingham East Leber said that "we want to make meetings inclusive and productive."
In my eight years as a local Leber MP, the first Friday night GSI meeting was exactly the same.
Sadly, however, today, it is not the sound of the meeting and the promise of "gentle, gentle" politics has been forgotten for a long time, if it does ever begin.
It is increasingly apparent that there are no differences in the party and that it is acceptable for group leadership to be judged on a case-by-case basis.
When Jeremy became leader, it started that I thought with my colleagues that I was announcing the same political viewpoint they were hoping to take the U-turn on me and say that I would not be in any situation – whether national security or the U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-
Every time I speak in public – and even if nothing happens to what I say – there is a call to get rid of social media, a condemnation of central politics, and I'm told that I shouldn't be at the party.
And it's not just my own experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have made are also political.
I've been surprised to see all of my colleagues who face the storm of daily sexual violence that is contradictory or racist, but never ashamed of their professionalism and their ideas.
The most disappointing aspect of politics in this century is how Galagali's inadequacies have become normal
Last week, Jeremy Karbin claimed that the Leber Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free organization and that each "unsafe" vote or election rule constricts the group.
For the past two years, many have advised me to keep my head down, not so much talk and whether I'll be "right"
But I came to politics not to do this.
When I joined Lebar 32 years ago as a school student, we were encouraged by the neglect of the theatre government that literally destroyed the classes of our extensive school, and I tried to provide the necessary government services – whether as a local councillor or as a minister of government.
I never hid my politics with the last election.
No one in the Ntingham East has been confused about my policy position and the areas of conflict with current leadership.
For those who spread this movement on Friday, I will only say that when the country is moving towards a brunch that would damage the family, business and our services, I cannot understand the intention to be loyal to the leader of the Lever Party to waste my time and energy.
But I really don't have a message for Ntingham Momentum, whether it's a member of my constituency or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of unrest or political urgency will prevent me from telling the best of what I believe for all of you.

Iron 38-17 Melrose: Rise at the head of undefeated iron
Two attempts at the end of the day can be somewhat reduced, but there is no doubt that this day's premiere match was worth winning.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated group in ten.
Finally, it was their best defense, just as it was their ability to take the opportunity, which helped the group to win and the right reason to be happy with the Cos Peter Morchi.
"We've been tested in every game so far, and we're still defeated, so I have to be happy."
Melrose's rabbi Christie says: "Iar needs credit, they've done better than we have done."
For the 14th minute of Grant Anderson's attempt, Frasier Klimo converts the ice into ice, however, a yellow card from Rury Hughes of Scotland, which evicts him from the wares for the game, makes Melrose the majority and tries to make Jason Baggot a failure.
In the Klimo Panel, the air lead was increased, just before, at the time of the haftime, it was released into a single attempt to break 17-5.
Melrose, however, well started second grade, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn the bagot into five points.
Then, for a long time, the game was stopped for the serious impact of the Rüyred Nott, which became a stretcher and after the game was resumed, much more went on through the action of Stefan McDoval, which was transformed by Klimo.
Air's heavy-duty leader Blair McFerson then took a yellow card and set up an additional player for the Air's Bruce Colvin of Melrose at the end of a critical pressure.
Even though the guests come right back, and when they see Klimo's yellow card to fight without speaking, they push down the MacFerson from the panel line and push down the revenue mill.
Klimo converts again, Kyle Roo when David Armstrong's box of kicks and sends Gregor Henry out to the fifth attempt on Home Side.

'The sea is ours': on the ground, Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Nabekra La Paz is providing a rigging Klade Nevall's office.
Public buildings are flying a sea-blue flag.
From Lake Tikaca, the Navy is designed by the prime minister: "The sea is our right"
It's a task to restore ""
All over Bolivia, the memory of the Gulf of Chile is still clear to Chile in the fight against a bloody resource of the 18th century – just as it is to visit the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are probably highest in a few decades, because Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years' discussion.
"Bolivia has the speed, unity and natural awareness, and of course we expect results with a positive outlook," said Bolivia's Foreign Minister Roberto Calzadila.
Many Bolivians will see a large screen across the ice-rolling country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support the claim that, after a few decades of proper discussion, Chile is forced to discuss giving Bolivia a sovereign outlet on the sea.
Evo Morales, the Bolivian Carishmatic Indigenous President - who will face a controversial fight to re-election next year - also depends on the decision of Monday.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he promised by the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is not possible to decide on Bolivia's behalf - and if so, it will change a little.
The United Nations based in the Netherlands is not able to land Chile and has indicated that they will not determine the possible outcome of the discussion.
The final argument of the ICJ's ruling is that the case was "not complicated", said Chilean International Law Specialist Page Jeret.
And in the past four years, it could go back behind the cause of Bolivia.
"The current Bolivian administration has raised the issue of access to the sea," Jeret said.
Morals's speech against the war has brought about any heartfelt happiness in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk for a while, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Since 1962, the two countries have not been able to exchange the state.
The Bolivian representative, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzi, has rejected the unusually rapid decision of the Court of Justice.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring an opportunity to "an extraordinary opportunity for a new age in relation to Chile" and "to stay in line with each other's interests for 139 years".
Kalzadila also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using Mertimem as a political breakthrough.
"Bolivia will never abandon access to the Pacific," he added.
"It's a chance to see that we have to get rid of the past"
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come until the United States has believed in it.
North Korea's Deputy Prime Minister Ree Yong Ho said his people would not be able to release nuclear weapons if Washington could not be trusted.
He gave this speech at the general session of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promise he made at a summit in Singapore of opposition leaders.
His comments come when Prime Minister Mike Pompey of the United States of America seems to be on his way to resume the brutal protests more than three months later with Kim Jong Won in North Korea.
Rey said it was a "pipe dream" that would continue the bans and threaten North Korea in the US about the announcement of the end of the Korean war.
Washington warned that Pyongyang would be able to accept this announcement without first taking notice.
Kim and the U.S. president, Donald Trump, wanted a second convention.
However, there is great doubt that Pyongyang is the only way to guarantee his country's security.
Pompe wants to go to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp meeting.
Paris Fashion Shows publishes the last line of huge headsets on a high street road near you
If you want to increase your top collection or block the sun completely, no longer need to be seen.
The designer Valentino and Thom Brown Runway discovered a series of supersighted heads for their SS19 collections, which shortened the style set during the Paris fashion week.
In the summer, the most inappropriate tops have been shaded in the Instagram, and these designers have sent their eyebrows to Katwa.
Valentine's creation was one of a top-the-top beiz top that was decorated with a wide edge like the sheet that covered the models.
Other overrides include a beautiful turmuse, a wizard's hat, even an anchor - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Brown also published a choice of volleyball and Halloween at just the right time.
Many of the colored masks were similar to the Hannibal lecturer.
A creation with snorkel and Googles is similar to a full Scooby Diving gear, the other one looks like a bad ice cream.
And if you continue the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that large boats can reach you on high streets.
Outsided hats are competing for 'La Bombay', a two-foot two-legged kangaroo hat that has been seen from Ryana to Emily Ratazkovski.
Kalt Labelty sent Katwa another big creation behind the highly unreasonable cloth that spreads through social media - a stretch of silk bag that is almost as big as a silk-dressing model.
Paris Fashion Wik was the second one with a white leather handle in the collection of the SS19 of the La Riverera of Jakimas.
Celebrity Stylist Luke Armitage Fimail said: 'I hope that big hats and special bags will appear on high street next summer - because the design has so much impact, it will be difficult to ignore the needs of the over-crowded relatives.'
John Edward: Language skills required for the world’s citizens
Scotland's independent schools have kept a record of academic excellence, and it has continued to produce an unparalleled test in 2018, which is supported by personal and collective success in the efforts of the sport, art, music and other communities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independents School (SSIS), are trying to provide their students and parents with the best possible level of service.
Lonely schools aim to prepare their place as their chosen profession and world citizens for more and higher education.
As an educational area that can design and apply a special school curriculum, we continue to see modern language as popular and popular in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language that he means, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, he'll be in his heart."
It is a powerful sign that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
As a result of this year's recent test, we see that languages are top of the league tables with the highest pass losses in the single school.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages won a higher degree.
According to data from the 74 members of the SSIS school, 72 per cent of students achieved higher grades in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German studies, 69 per cent French studies, and 63 per cent of Spanish studies.
It proves that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
The language is now taking place in the same way as the single school curriculum and elsewhere (science, technology, technology and mathematics).
A 2014 review by the EU Commission for Employment and Skills shows that 17 percent of employers have been responsible for losing their language skills due to the lack of sufficient funding.
More and more, language skills have become indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are needed in the world around the world for the possibility of further action.
Any career they choose, if they learn the second language, they will have the real advantage of gaining their lifelong skills in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners automatically presupposes a multilingual person to compete.
In 2013, 75 percent of Ugov’s more than 4,000 adults were not able to speak well in any foreign language during the conversation, and 15 percent of the French language was the only language in the decade.
This is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
More languages, especially those of the developing economy, will give children a better opportunity to find meaningful workshops.
In Scotland, each school will be divided into the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will be considered to be the most important languages in Uuk, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in independent schools, including specialized education.
Scottish independent schools are requested to provide an environment for education that will prepare children and create them with the skills needed to succeed in any future.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied at this time that languages play an important role for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Actually, modern languages should really be regarded as "the skills of international communication."
Lonely schools will provide these preferences, diversity and excitement for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent School
Lebron will reveal himself at Sunday's Lakes in San Diego
Lebron James is almost finished waiting for the fans to see the first trip from Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coch Luke Walton announced that in San Diego, the President of the Opener James was playing against Denver Nagets on Sunday.
However, the number of minutes he plays is not yet set.
"It's going to be less than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After this week's training, James was asked about his plans for the six-game award for Lakers.
"I don't need my prince's game to prepare for my career," he said.
At the time of Ellie of West Virginia, Trump, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump, West Virginia, stormed the campaign meeting tonight.
It was the first of five tofsil meetings in the following week, with a friendly location with Tennessee and Mississippi.
The purpose of the Supreme Court is to create support for the election of the Supreme Court for its election, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
What was the time for the West Virginia convention tonight, and how do you view it online?
The meeting of the Tromper Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the West Virginia convention below by live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk this week about the election of the Supreme Court candidate Bret Cavenar, which has been shaken by the allegations of sexual abuse by an expected Senate vote during the FBI investigation.
However, the primary objective of these meetings is to help the Republicans to achieve some speed in the face of November's election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that next week the five of Ellie's aims were "to strengthen volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and the representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress Control is so important to its agenda that we will travel as much as possible to the kingdom as possible with the introduction of a busy campaign," a broadcaster from the non-profit trumpet told Reuters.
Today's meeting for the Wesbenco Arena in Hulling "can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring cover from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Last month, as the second time in Saturday, Trump travelled to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent points in 2016.
In front of the Trump election, the candidate of the West Virginia Republican Senate is trying to help Patrick Morrisica, who is behind bars.
According to Reuters, West Virginia University politician Simon Hedar said, "It is not very good for Mary to try to encourage her in the election," he said.
Reader Cap 2018: Team U.S.A. shows the hunger for fighting to keep the unit on Sunday.
At the end of the three half-hour session, Saturday evening forsammy needed this reader cup.
Momentum's pendulum floor is a completely invented game idea, but players really believe it, and it's most popular in this national competition.
So where are they going to say the minute now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little moment now," Jordan Spith said to leave for the day.
Europe has the opportunity, of course, to remain at four more points.
As Spith said, Americans think they have some help on their way and can be encouraged by a lot of things, especially the Spith and Justin Thomas forms that played together every day and took three out of four.
Spith was deadly from the beginning to the end and leading from the front.
With his rounds, he was stronger at celebrating, when he and Tommas were behind two points after they had scored, and the four-point full score was as important as removing the match.
His suit was the same as the match they won on the 15th, which makes you think he believes that the American team is not out of it.
"You really need to go deep and think about your match," Spith said.
There are now all these players.
18 holes to mark.
More points have been found in the last two days than in Spith and Tommas, only French milleries and Tommy Fleetwood, reader cup's justice story.
It's strange in Europe, but half a couple can't make four or none mistakes.
"Molloid" was the only couple who didn't shoot a bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday evening and Friday morning.
The race, and their power, seemed to be moving towards and out of this exciting crowd, as if they were defeated on Sunday, and with the sunset in Le Golf National, there was no more popular player to win the European victory without fleeting or milling.
It's better if they're both at the same time.
Even though European pride has been on the rise.
When he was dating Alex Norren, Bobba Watson and Web Simpson had a problem with the Forebel Najk Sergio García in the morning.
In the first nine, a bogie and two double Spaniards and Swede put them in a pit where they could never get up.
On Sunday, though, no one is going to get you out of your pit.
The mutual deception between the pair, which they recommend, which does not recommend and which can be changed immediately, is very attractive because of the force and the closeness of the forum.
Europe has so far played well as a team and has taken an important lead on the final day, but this forum has further shown that there is a team of USS hunger for the fight that suspected something, especially the stateside.
Europe takes 10-6 lead on the final day of the Reader Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, the Forum and the Forsam match will take advantage of Europe's 10-6-year-old lead against the United States.
The encouraging pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari have now taken their plate to four points against the Tiger Woods, twice in the leadership of the Golf National.
The European team of Tommas Jørn, two years ago, is begging for the recovery of the lost truffle in Hazeltin, beating the poor American side between 3 and 1 in the morning.
America is proposing more resistance to two matches, but they couldn't fill the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12th match to restore the trophy.
Tana Four Point Flywood is the first European rock and he and his millinary, together after a remarkable week in the history of the Rider Cup, only the second pair of four points from the first four matches.
Woods and Patrick read behind the fork, and then lost Woods and U.S. Rocky Brison DeKambiu were heavily imprisoned by Superbly to defeat 5 and 4.
On Saturday, the two-massed teddy bears sometimes sparked a lightning storm, but now he has lost 19 match and tana seven between his foreball and 29 match of Forsam.
Justin Rose, taking a break for the morning forum, returned to the Forsam partner, Henry Stanson, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coupkar's 2 and 1 defeats - one and three numbers from the world.
Although it was not on its own in Europe on the day of the wind, it was a moratorium to the south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas set up a scale for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 against the Spanish Zone Ram and Ian Polter in Forrbal, and lost Polter and Rary McLray back in 4 and 3.
In the history of the Ryder cup, only a group like twice has returned from four points of defeat, even though it is now necessary to restore the Furic side's trophies.
After being the second best for two days, however, on Sunday, it seems it will leave them.
North Korea said 'how' not to be isolated without faith.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the existing ban was deepening the lack of faith in the United States and that there was no chance of leaving the country's nuclear weapons alone in this national situation.
At the annual general session of the Rey Yong Ho World Organisation, North Korea said that last year, it took positive steps to stop the nuclear and nuclear testing, break the nuclear test, and promise not to expand the range of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons."
"Then we couldn't see any similar reactions in the United States."
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no trust in our national security and there is no way to free ourselves from this national situation."
Although describing North Korea's "level-based" method of remanding against North Korea's remand, his speech was emphatically based on the fact that he did not put the remand out of action in North Korea, because Pyongyang had done so in the past.
On June 12, he mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Won and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the US President and North Korea's leader in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the "exploitation of Korean sub-oils" and when he gave a security guarantee to North Korea.
North Korea is looking for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
The call for severe international bans on Washington North Korea has also been rejected.
"America" has stressed disarmament-first" and has increased pressure by bans to achieve their goals with coercion, even against the declaration of the end of the war." Rey said.
"The bans can put our ground on this idea of a strange dream for those who don't know.
But the problem is that the ban continues to deepen our disbelief."
There was no comment on the plan of the second summit between Rey Kim and the Trump, which was first mentioned by the United States Prime Minister.
Instead of Minister Mohandy, Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jain mentioned three meetings last five months: "If South Korea were not the United States, it would not have been so difficult to eradicate the Korean sub-island."
However, Rey's speech was dramaticly different from last year when he told the UN to target North Korea's main mainland when "Mr. Evil President" called the Trump Kim "Rocket Man" himself.
In the UN this year, Trump threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, he praised Kim for her courage in taking action to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and the bans would have to be maintained until North Korea is disarmed.
Wednesday Trump said there's no time for it, he said, "If it takes two years, three or five months, nothing can happen."
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the U.N. Security Council
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike has also told Americans that on Thursday, the Security Council: "The Security Council's bans must continue to be effective until we fully understand the fully-fledged disarmament."
The bans on North Korea has been increasing since 2006.
Pompeii also met with the general clergy of the United Nations in Esembly and then said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second convention.
North Korea has already travelled three times this year, but its last trip is not good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that some progress had been made, just a few hours before North Korea accused him of "like Gunda".
North Korea promised to break a missile site and a nuclear complex to meet with Mun this month if the United States accepted "imitation."
He said that Kim was looking for what he was looking for was the security guarantee in Trump Singapore and the security guarantee that went to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking sufficient rest.
This year, Harvard University's new Caffeine-Zbalani course is giving all of its students more sleep to cope with the growing culture of the teacher at night."
One scholar discovered that students at a number of universities are often confused about how to take care of themselves.
Harvard Medical School's sleep medicine teacher and Brigham and female hospital expert Charles Sicily has developed this course, which he believes is the first in the United States.
After giving a talk about what had affected the lack of sleep in school, he was moved to start the course.
A woman came to me at last and said, ‘Why is it that I was told to come to my senior year?’
He said that anyone who never told him about the importance of sleep - what surprised me, he told the telegraph.
This year's course, which began the first time, explains how students can improve their general health by helping them sleep well in academic and athletic performance.
Paul Barra, the director of the Harvard Medical School of Health and Health Services at the University, said that the students decided to start the course after they had been seriously out of sleep during the week.
For an hour, there are some related tasks in the course.
In one section there is a picture of a student room where students click on coffee cups, screens, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are affected by sleep loss and understand the importance of a Bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer
A map of the campus with an interactive icon and then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately
However, we believe that they have the right to know - even though you decide to smoke, you have the right to know its effects on health, 'professor Cecilar added.
He says that the culture of "Saraat's pride" still exists, he says, is an increasing problem of sleeping because of the increasing pressure on modern technology and students.
A student should be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety to make sure that you sleep well enough, he says -- even the sleep deprivation makes the brains miserable, it continues to make them hungry."
In a 19-year-old study of chemical and physical biology in California, Professor Sejiler helped design the course, taking a class at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all senior students will be asked to complete a study programme prior to their participation in the competition.
Teacher Sicily suggested that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the 'Blue Light' produced by the Wieduttin Screen and LED Light, which may destroy your Circedian booth, thus showing the problem of falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: the victory of Manger Gollir Gerard.
The Dolly Menger goal, Steven Gerard's elite team, was defeated between 1 and 0 by the Rangers another AA match.
On February 4-1 in St. Johnston, the Ibrex team had another victory, but Gary Holt's team won the second victory as manager on March 18th, which led him to eight points away from the top of the Leadbroke.
Menga was hit seven minutes ago by Haf-time, but the hopeful Rangers line-up could never hit them.
The Rangers have now gone down to sixth place, Livingston has gone up to third place, and left the hibernian behind the goal.
And there may be more problems for the rangers because of the need to treat Linsman Calam Spanes for any object that is short on the edge of the wing.
The Gerard group has changed eight that took the top to the Betfred cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, went along with the same Livy 11 who took a point from Harts last week and was proud of how his handsome team had slowed the opponent down.
The rangers may have the power to take over the rangers, but Livingston did more than they did.
If Scott Pittman was sent to Le-of-Allan McGriger's team for the first time, they should have been scored for only two minutes, but the midfielder had ruined his chances.
A long free-kick leader of Kahhan Jacquebs had received Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithago, was only able to hit the back post.
The rangers had reinvigorated control of the boat, but the final thord had more hope than their belief in the game.
Alfredo Morlos must have felt that his panel should have been found in the quarter-east due to his and Steven Lollez's clash, but the rapporteur answered the request from Steven Thompson.
The Rangers can only target two first-class shots, but the head of the former Ebrox goalkeeper Liam Kali Lasana was a little troubled by the shooting of the head and OVI of Azerbaijan.
Liver's 34-minute creative goal may have been against the current of the game, but no one can deny that they alone have the right to play the game.
The Rangers failed to complete the late set-up of the Jacobs.
Because of the collapse of the Dean Galagar Scott Robinson's ball, Scott Arfield did not respond, he kept his head cool to choose Menga for general finishing.
Gerard took part in a break with Ryan Kent and was about to work with him because he was in Morl, but the amazing Kelly was out of line.
Livingston viewers, however, began to play the kind of game they enjoyed, after Lithago and halkett had spoken for a long time.
Holt's team was able to move on to the final stage, but MacGreger stopped trying to destroy Jacobs before heading from Lithago Corner.
With Jacobs, Thomason again turned his face to the subsidiary of the Rangers, which demanded that the late panel be caught up with him.
Almanak: Founder of the Gigar counter.
And now a page of our "Sande Morning" Almanak: September 30, 1882, from 136 years ago... the day the natural scientist Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany in the future.
Gigar created a method for detecting and measuring vigour, a discovery known as the gigar counter.
Since then, a basic foundation of science has become the foundation of a pop culture, in 1950, in a film entitled "Bless Of Kornado", possible Kaupok scientist Roy Rogers and Del Evans:
People: "What's this again?"
Rogers: "It's a guitar counter, used to detect active fossils like Urenium.
When you make these phone calls, you can hear the effects of blood pressure on the mines."
Evans: "Is that too much to say?"
"Hans" Gigar died a few days before his 63rd birthday in 1945
However, his designated discovery is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the detection of poor cells to the immune system.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill the affected cells.
As part of the vaccine, the immune system learns to detect poor cells
The method includes removing the cells that prevent the disease and changing them in the lab.
Then they can 'see' a common protein for many cancers and then re-enter.
A test vaccine has shown a number of positive results with cancer patients.
A woman who has been treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect poor cells, has been invisible for more than 18 months.
The method is to remove cells that are resistant to the disease, to modify them in the test so that they can see many of HER2's common proteins "see" and then re-enter the cells.
Professor J. Burzfsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute at the Battlesde of Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 explains Professor Burzfski's explanation for the increase in cancer of various types, including breast, dimbashi, fusfus and colorectal cancer.
Disease prevention cells outside patients and "How to Target Cancer Cells" have also been used to treat Lukemia to "teach" them.
Canye West SNL joined the Pro-Tramp dispute after a MAGA hat
It didn't work out.
Kanei West was set up in a studio after a bad performance in satard's Night Life, where she praised President Donald Trump for staying in sleep in the United States in 2020.
After performing his third night song in Host Town, where he received a Mac America Great Cap, he denounced the Democrats and reiterated his support for the trumpet.
"Sometimes when I talk to a white person, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's a writer?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd come out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL Matt Daemon started the show with a sketch where Hollywood star Christine Blaji Ford had fun at the Senate Judicial Committee with Bret Cavern's testimony about the claim of sexual violence.
Although it has not been disseminated, West's funny football actor Chris Rock social media uploads.
Although it's not clear who tried to mock the West with the rock post.
In addition, West accused listeners of having to face problems with his head in the backstage.
"They put me in the backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out after the hat.'
They kicked me!
And then they said I'm in a dive, according to Washington Examiner.
West also says, "Do you want to see the place?" He says he'll read his "superman cap, because you can't tell me what it means to do."
Then try with love."
His comments were repeated at least twice from the viewer, and the SNL cast members were upset, the Vary told the publisher that "the whole studio had a penthouse in silence."
West was brought as an alternative to the singer Ariana Grand, whose former lover, Appar Mac Mila, died a few days ago.
The West I Love It Sings is a beautiful Peruvian bottle that deceives many.
The West Protective Group of TPUSAR received support from the main Candes Turner, who tweeted: "Thank you for standing up against the rapists."
But the Toxo representative Karen Hunter tweeted that the West "was what it was and she was very poor."
"Then I chose not to reward anyone (who buys his music or clothes or who supports his "art") who is attaching and spreading a harmful pattern to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now officially known as the Cana West.
D is not the first artist to change his name and follows his path, known as Puff Daddy, Puff and Paddy.
Another contemporary apper, Snoop Dog's name was Snoop Lion, and of course the early royal prince, changed his name to a symbol that was previously known as the Prince.
Trying to kill at the restaurant in Belfast
On Friday at a restaurant in East Belfast, a man was accused of attempted murdering a 45-year-old man after he was stabbed.
The police have reported that the incident has taken place in Balihakamori.
On Monday of Asami, the Belfast Magistrates Court is scheduled to attend.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington attacked the toxic masculinity or poisoned humanity.
Kitt Harington HBIo is known for his role as a warlord in the medieval fantasy game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor said about the stereotype of Macho Nayak, that this national role on the screen means that it is hard to think of young children as being respected.
While talking to Sande Times, Kit believed that something was wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in #MeToo.
Kitt, who recently married Rose Leseley, a member of the Game of Thrones, at the age of 31, admitted that she felt strongly about the problem.
'I personally, feel very strongly, right now - where are we wrong men?' he said.
'What did we teach them when men were old that we are now facing this problem?'
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic massculinity for its many male characteristics.
He also says, 'What do we learn and what we learn?
What do you learn on TV and on the street that children seem to follow this particular path when they are men?
I think it's really the biggest question of this time - how do we change it?
That is because there has certainly been a great error in the young men .
In the interview, he admitted that when the next summer the series will be new, he will not play any game of thrones in the regular or psychological way, he said he ended the life of 'fighting and horses'.
From November on, Kit Sam Shepard will be performing in the restoration of the True West, which is a film producer and his brother-in-law.
The actor recently published that he considered his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife at this show, so it gave my future family my life.
Rose Ami Award-victory Fantasy series acted as an irritant character of John Snow's character.
In June 2018, this couple married Lesley’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has increased 14% in new events.
China has reported a 14% increase in HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 affected people in the country, health officials say.
Nearly 40,000 new events have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were caused by a sexual conflict, which has changed since the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading to different parts of China to perform blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been nearly zero, Chinese Health Officers said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
Although the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased every year, the number of people living in China has increased by 100,000.
Sex is a major problem for the Chinese LGBT community in the HIV crisis.
In 1997, homosexuality was validated in China, but it is still considered to be the case against LGBT people.
Because of the country's conservative values, it is estimated that between 70 and 90% of men have sex with men, they later marry women.
Many people come from inadequate sexual protection in this area.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV as part of its efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters Zeopy Senators rejects 'dangerous lies' and 'machining facts'
On Saturday, the United States Republican Maxin Waters denied the claim that one of its members posted personal information on Wikipedia by three Republican US senators.
The Los Angeles Democrat strongly claimed that these claims are being disseminated by "Altra-Wright Wing" and websites.
"False, lie and more hate lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The release tells us that the US senators' home address and phone numbers include both Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Haas, both U.S.A.
On Thursday, this information was posted online, the Supreme Court's elected candidate posted an unknown person to the Capitol Hill when the Senate panel heard the charges of sexual abuse against Bret Cavenar.
After questioning the three senators, it was just a moment ago.
Protective sites such as the Gateway and Redstate reported that the IP address identified the post source was connected to the Waters office and reported on any members of the Waters Actors.
"This baseless accusation is a complete lie and a false lie," the Waters continues.
"Members of my employees - whose identity, personal data and security has been accused of this fraud and false accusations - were not responsible for the falsification of this information.
This baseless accusation is a complete error and a false lie."
Waters' statement has received many reviews online with the former press of the Quick White House.
"This refusal is angered," Flasher wrote.
"It says he doesn't have the guts to become a member of Congress.
They won't be angry when they're accused of something they haven't done.
Of course they won't argue.
They should certainly not be questioned about the complainant's intentions.
They will be safe and sound."
Compared with the democratic's criticism of the judge's cavern, the firefighters thought he was very angry while he was listening on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is choosing to elect Waters in the middle elections, also published his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true it's big," he tweets.
In his statement, Waters said his office warned the "used authorities and law enforcement agencies" about these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that criminals will be released," he continued, "and any members of my staff who are destructive and dangerous for all their actions will be legally held accountable."
Johnny English Strikes Agnes Review - Weak Ryan Atkinson Privacy
It is now traditional to see the Brexit scene in any new image with a British shot and it seems to be suitable for the reconstruction of John’s English action-commedy Pope Francis – which began with John’s English in 2003 and returned to John’s English River in 2011.
Clearly, how many junkies are we going to be able to make that self-reproaching issue?
Any loss, pop-eyed, unrestrained Johnny has a license to create new things like the second time - his name suggests that he designed a wide-ranging comic book for the world of cinemas other than English.
He must have been a stupid secret representative who, despite the thrilling excitement of the moment, contributed a note to the 2012 Olympic Festival of Shariots of Fire Theme Town in London, a Dash of Mr. Bin.
He was based mainly on the Traveler, and people of the international secret atkinson were acting on Berkecard TV advertisements that had been forgotten once and for all, spreading confusion in science.
This last Jai exit has one or two miserable moments.
After the medieval Burmese clothes, I liked to see Johni English come to a helicopter in a bit of helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical entertainment is being shown, but ridicule has been very low and strangely exaggerated, especially in 2007 and mission impossibile "Syrias" film brand is now offering himself as an element of self-confidence.
The joke seems to be aimed at children more than adults, and I don't think the events in John's English are as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent film.
The topic is a major problem for Great Britain for many years.
A cyber hacker hacked into the very secret web of Britain's secrets, a small role for all British agents in the field, to discourage the responsible agent - sadly for Kevin Edden.
It is the ultimate trust of a prime minister who has already suffered the full misery of politics, he is a poor and impenetrable person: Emma Thompson has done his best with this semi-Terresa character, but there is nothing more like working in a script.
His search advisors told him that every active secretor was burned, so he had to get someone out of bed.
And it means calling Johni English, who is now a school teacher in some other institutions, but teaching off the record about how to become a student worker: there are some good jokes here, as English is offering school at the Rock-Type Academy in Goendagiri.
For the emergency briefing, English Whitehall returned and again met with his former long-lasting sidekick.
Bau is now a married person, married to a submarine commander, a zly-hky-stick role in which Vicky Pepperdine has been a bit neglected.
So, in the action of Batman and Robin, Hurricane Olga Corleneco, a woman named Ophelia Bulitover, faced a fatal mistake in the service of the Majesty's Secret.
Already, Prime Minister Carishmatics is dangerously falling into the magic of the Technology Billion, who claims that he can solve the problems of the British computer: the criminal Jason Volta in Jack Lassie.
English and Bau begin the strange sound of their far-reaching high-gin: they set fire to a flash French restaurant in the middle of the weather; they self-drive into a volleyball boat and begin to steal; and they create a clean state to get to know each other inside the English volleyball house.
All the stops have been cut for the last time, but the more Myanmar and open, the more children think about the whole thing.
A lot of middle staff.
And I couldn't think of it as other English films: can't the British film artist Ryan Atkinson play a role that really does justice to his performance?
Lebar denies that he plans to work for Britain for four days a week but gets paid for five days
Jeremy Karbin's Labour Party will consider a major plan that British workers will work for four days a week - but will be paid for five days.
According to the report, the organization's owners would like to share an additional day's holiday savings with employees through artificial intelligence (AI).
It will try to enjoy a three-day holiday for workers - but will still pay the same wage.
According to sources, the idea will be 'fit' with the group's financial record and plans to move the country to the workers.
Trade Union Congress has approved a four-day shift in order to allow workers to change their economy.
A senior member of the Leber Party told The Sande Times: 'A policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It's not a night, it's a four-day workday that suits the team's method of maintaining balance in the economy for the work of the team.'
In support of this national idea, the Green Party promised four-day workdays during its 2017 general election campaign.
Desire is not currently supported by the Leber Party, however.
A spokesperson at the Leber Party said: 'A four-day working day party is not a policy and is not considered by the group.'
Shado Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Work Conference to express his views on a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to restore the ability of 'unidentified' and 'beneficiary' to the facilities.
Shareholders in Shado Chancellor's planning funds can get back their entire share of the water because the labor government may 'distort' some of the wrong work.
He also confirmed the plan to keep employees on the organization board and to create ownership fees for 10 per cent of non-governmental organizations, which amounted to $500 a year.
In Lindsey Graham, tell John Kennedy "60 minutes" whether Kavana's FBI can change their mind
Judge Brett Kavana, the FBI's investigation of charges against the Supreme Court, has been delayed for at least a week at the end of the vote on his nomination, and asked whether the Bureau's investigations could bring back their support to any republican senator.
In an interview on Sunday, a "60-minute" reporter named Scott Pelly Republican asked the senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find out what led them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than her partner in South Carolina.
"I think, of course," Kennedy said.
"I asked to go to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavana.
After this incident, I called him, and the accusation came out, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was a man of great resolve and determination.
Graham's vote, of course, seems unchangeable.
"My brother-in-law has developed a mind-set and a very important complaint will be needed to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bret strongly rejected it," Christine Blaci added Graham.
"And whose name he said they couldn't check.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."
What has Global Citizen Festival done and done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event that has a poor line-up of star performances and a equally dramatic mission; the world's poverty remains.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will not only see thousands of people turning to the Great Lon of Central Park to enjoy such acts as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendez, but also increase awareness of the real target of the event of extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is an extension of the global poverty project, a group that is expected to increase the number of people actively involved in the international fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), a number of Consertgo's actions or "activities" such as volunteering, e-mailing a university, calling a phone or helping to raise awareness about their goal in order to make ends meet.
How successful, though, is the 12 - year - old Global Citizen in achieving its goal?
What real steps are being taken to encourage people to take action through a non-profit concert, or another case of so-called "clickivism" - where people think they're really signing an online application or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has been saying that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving towards different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to declare the same promises and principles as the $37 billion that will affect people's lives in 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had quoted 390 promises and announcements that began from its work, including at least $10 billion already in distribution or tax.
The group's assumption that the safe haven has so far affected nearly 649 million people throughout the world.
Some of the main promises are the commitment of U.S.-based investors to "help children increase their full potential" and the promise to provide Rwanda 35 million after more than 4,700 Global Citizen tweets.
"With the help of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens, we can make the social injustices of crime a cornerstone of history," said Tracy Ulman to the public of London during a concert held in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 steps have been taken in the United States to improve mothers and children's nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, which will reach 5 million women and children in poverty.
A frequently asked question on its website will answer the question "What do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and strong path - we will ever fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-discrimination movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mandes, Cardi B, General Monny New York, is one of the most performers in this year's event, which will be held by Deborah-Le Fernes and Hue Jackman.
The Russian firefighting can be used to stop the army from "defence" - the U.S.
Washington can take refuge in its ship's "necessary" to prevent the arrival of Russian fuels in the Middle East, according to Washington's investigator, US internal Scyb Ryan Jink.
Jink claims that Russia's merger in Syria - where it works in invitation to a legitimate government - is a mistake to look around the new fuel market.
"I believe that their position in the Middle East is the reason they want to power like the Eastern Europe, the South European Centre," he said.
And according to the authorities, there are ways and means to take care of it.
He said, "We have the ability of the United States to keep the sea free and, if necessary, to prevent their fires from entering the market."
In the United States of America, a useful group known as the voice of Zabalani's customers spoke for participants in the event by the Energy Alliance of Conjuma.
He compared the use of Washington with Russia and Iran in real terms.
"Russia is referred to as a "astin card" with an economy based on biofuel, "the financial options of Iran and Russia are less profitable than more fuel," he said.
Instead of the Trump administration in Russia, these statements are being made when European customers are expected to have a large number of natural gas exports to Europe.
With the authority of the Trump administration, President Donald Trump of the United States is attempting to stop Germany from "unsuitable" North Stream 2 pipeline projects, according to the Trump, it is being held in the hands of Berlin Moscow."
Moscow once again stresses that the 11 billion US dollar North Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the power of the existing pipeline, is ready to take 110 billion cubic metres - it is a fully-fledged project.
Cremlin's argument is that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing more than a financial one, and it's an example of an unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that we cannot be used as a fire-pressing tool and should be able to choose customers," Minister Alexander Novak of the Russian Fire Department said after a meeting with US Minister Rick Peri in Moscow in September.
The situation in the United States has resulted in a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the German project.
In the field of art, the German Federation of German Industry (BDI) told the United States to stay away from the bilateral agreement between the European Union's fuel policies and Berlin and Moscow.
"After the recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Marcel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the federation of German Industry (BDI) said that our problem is a major problem at the hands of a third country in our Lebanese border.
Elizabeth Warren 2020's "look at the crowd" in the bid for presidents, Massachusetts's senator says
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that after the interior election, he would "see" the petition for the president's petition.
Warn assures us that he is in competition when a town of Massachusetts Hollyak.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government we've been reading and include women in the top," he says.
"After November 6, I will strongly oppose the President."
Warren Town is saying that during the course of the day, President Donald Trump is driving the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," he said.
Warren Trump and the Supreme Court of the Trump face criticism of Bret Kavanawagh.
On Friday, in a tweet, Warren said, "We need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A review published on Thursday shows that most Warren's voters do not believe that he should fight in his election in 2020.
The Sofok University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe said that the five percent of Massachusetts's "possible" voters said that the Senate should not fight in the vote.
The year-on-year fighting has been supported.
The review shows that more support for the fight against the vote of the former government Devil Patrick, where 38 percent supported the possible fight and 48% did not.
Other high profile democratic names discussed during the 2020 vote include former Vice President Joe Byden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Associated Press reported that Byden officially decided to take a decision in January.
At the meeting of the whole Palin Donald Trump, the track Pauline quoted PTSD
The 26-year-old track Palin spent a year listing Iraq in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with internal violence
"He said to the audience at a Donald Trump meeting in Oklahoma, "By coming back to my own son, through whom he's going, I can understand other families who can understand the consequences of what the PTSD and our soldiers are going through."
Palin calls his arrest a "home hand" and says about his son and other war-experts, "they come back a little bit, they come back strong, they come back to think about whether the military and the air force and the other members of the army are respectful of their fellow workers?"
He was arrested in Alaska on Monday, and according to Dan Bennet, a spokesperson for the police, he was charged with family violence, arms and drug abuse against a woman.
18 Member States support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Attractive Member States and the District of Colombia are supporting Iney Challenges against a new US policy that refuses to protect victims of gang or family violence who have fled.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 Member States and districts in Washington, D.C., sent a friend to the Court of Justice on Friday to support a refugee who challenged the policy.
The full name of the citizen in the Greek V. Sessions case, which was filed in August against the US Civil Liberties Union federal policy, was not published.
He said his rival "and his violent gang members beat him, but US officials refused his asylum on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The Greek-supported Member States, for example El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, are experiencing widespread gang and family violence, from which a large number of asylum-seekers are coming to the United States.
The new American Refugee Policy reversed the 2014 Appellate Board's decision to allow unrestricted migrants to flee for domestic violence.
The District of Colombia, Attorney General Carl Rezin, said on Friday that the new policy "has ignored many decades of national, federal and international law."
Friends of the Court Brief say that "all refugees should be tried according to the specific information and circumstances of the application under this federal law and that the national ban violates the basic purpose."
In the statement, the Attorneys further argue that the policy of denying immigrants' entry is affecting the US economy, because they are more likely to be enthusiastic and "supply the necessary work."
The Attorney General of the Jeff Sessions of Immigration Judges ordered that family violence and gang violence should not be sheltered.
"Nation, religion, nationality or certain social group can be protected by oppression or fear for members or political opinions," he said in his policy statement at the June 11th session.
To say refuge is never a solution to all the problems - even all the deadly problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
The death toll between the efforts to save the living and the survival of Mary in the Palu
The answer was terrible for the survivors.
"The 35-year-old Risa Kusuma at the Palu city's shelter said to let her bright child be comforted," it was very disturbing."
"Every minute there's an ambulance coming.
Can't find clean water."
In an effort to save what can be found in the pool's water, people have returned to their own homes to be destroyed.
Hundreds of people are injured and 7.5 injured in hospitals.
Some of the injured people with a fracture in their back and shoulders are kept outside the Palu Army Hospital, being treated under the sky due to the forced next team.
During the time he and his wife were in the five-bedroom hotel room, he complained about how he felt about the earthquake.
"There was no time to save them.
I was stuck in the middle of the break, I guess," Harris, a news reporter, said they came to the city for a wedding.
"I can hear my wife's cry for help, then remain silent.
I don't know what happened to her or my kids.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador of China has charged with "galli" through "propaganda advertising"
A week after the U.S. newspaper of a Chinese government announced a four-page ad, the U.S. government accused the U.S. government of using U.S. press to launch an intentional campaign against U.S. state-of-the-art Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned the Ped Supplement to the Chinese Daily Des Mins Register last Wednesday, and accused China of attempting to intervene in the November 6th U.S. Congress.
Tramp is accused of trying to intervene in the Beijing U.S. elections, which the U.S. officials call a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
It's a natural event that the foreign government will advertise for commercial advertising, but Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war, which has resulted in an increase in imports of shulk.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that China's vengeful shells, such as Aywa, were designed to harm rapists in the Member States who supported the Tromp Republican Party in the first place.
The former U.S. envoy of the U.S. state and Ivor, Terry Branstad, who is a major agricultural reformer in China, says that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businessmen.
According to the Daes Mines Register of Branstad on Sunday, China "has now doubled the amount of noise by deliberately advertising our own independent press."
Branstad writes, "The Chinese government is taking the moral advantage of the freedom of speech and the free media's history in advertising money in the Das Mins Registry."
"On the other hand, you will find a limited voice in the streets of Beijing, and you will not see the real reflection of the Chinese people's differences in China's dangerous economic path, because the news media is in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He also said that his writing "refused to print a leading newspaper in China", although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Before the midterm debate in Kavanf, the Republicans wanted to keep women voters away, the analysts warned.
In the face of a number of complaints from the top Republican sex abuses, the Supreme Court's Nminini Brat Kavanf stood by and warned analysts in hiding that they would see a reaction from women especially in the upcoming midterm elections.
The issue has become increasingly intense, and most Republicans are already willing to vote publicly.
In a paper on Saturday, Professor of State Science at Maxwell University of Siracuz, Grant Rehir, told The Hill, "These can never be returned."
Rihar said that he had doubts about whether the pressure of Senator Jeff Flack (R-Arizona) would calm the angry voters in the final moment for the F.I. investigation.
According to the Washington Dyss newspaper, the former leader of the movement and national female spokesman Karen Jean-Pierre said on Friday, "Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it either tomorrow or November."
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, the protesters "comes on November" during the protests in the Senate on Friday morning, while deciding to proceed with the decision of the ruling panel of the Republicans on the nomination of Kavanf.
"Native political analyst Steve Rothenburg told this news site," democratic excitement and inspiration will be past.
"People are saying there's already too much; it's true.
However, it may be more, especially among the female voters in the city, and among the young voters between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before testifying to Ford’s public testimony against the Supreme Court’s elected candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans continue to approve, they may be involved in various forms of torture.
"It has become a complex matter for the GOP," former Chairman Michael Steel NBC News told the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just the committee's vote or the final vote or the Kafonf's being held back, the Republicans are telling the lead U.S. group, who are helping the voters, how they took it and how they used it."
However, the Americans felt a little confused about who should be believed in fords and kavanf's meeting, and the next person's opinion was heavy.
A new review of Yugoslavia shows that 41 per cent of respondents are sure to believe in the Ford witness, where 35 per cent say they believe in Kavanf.
Moreover, 38 percent said they thought Kavanf had probably lied at the time of his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the strike, FBI is currently investigating the charges against Debora Ramirez for Ford and the smallest other prosecutor, the Guardian's report.
Ford testified in front of the District Court Committee on the oath last week that he had been sent to Kavanf Nash at the age of 17.
Ramirez complains that in the 1980s, the Supreme Court Nmini showed him his youth at a party at Yale's seminar.
Google and Facebook have planned to start a new internet with World Wide Web promoters.
The World Wide Web's team is launching a platform to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology, the Incredible, is a company that will create Burns-Lier Open Source Platform solids.
Solid users have the right to choose where their data will be stored and what information people have access to.
In a concerted interview with Fast Company, Bernards-Lei said the Inrapt's real goal was "World Authority".
"We have to do this now," he said about the start.
"It's a historic moment."
This app allows everyone to create P and D or "Personal Online Data Store" using solid technology.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spitify in all the same browser and get the same.
The unique feature of the online data store is that it will depend entirely on the user who can access it.
The company called "personal power through data."
According to Sio John Bruce, the Inrapt's idea will help all to gain solidity, resources, processes and skills.
The organisation is currently a security platform purchased from Burns-leigh, Bruce, IBM, with a group of agreed on-staff developers and volunteers.
This week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own non-focused applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Burners-ley said he and his team "will start a complete change with Facebook and Google where all their business models will be completely changed at night."
"We don't ask for permission from them."
In a post on Saturday's media, Bernards-Lei writes that the Inrapt's "is intended to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid and to provide a facility"
In 1994, Bernards-ley Massachusetts Institute of Technology set up a World Wide Web Consortium to change the Internet.
In the past few months, Bernards-ley has been a strong voice in the net's privacy debate.
Will be the founder and director of the Burners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute at the time of such intrusion?
"I'm impossible hopeful about this future age on the web," Bernards-Lei added.
Bernard Van: Victoria Cross-Clarical celebration of the First World War
The Church of England is the only priest in the early centuries of the city who won the Victoria Cross during the first world war.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Van won the award at the September 29th, 1918, Belanglis and Lehancott attack.
However, he was killed four days later by a rebel and never knew he had the highest British military honor.
On Saturday at Northamptonsha's Russia, a Kushkawaj revealed his memorial to his two nephews.
One of his nephew Michael Van says it's "unusual" that this monument is being discovered just 100 years after his grandfather's ceremony.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion during the de Saint-Quantin Canal Paronena.
He then took off the fire line and led the line with "Serbs Boldness" and only one field song with him and three enemies were fired.
Lieutenant Colonel Van on 4 October 1918 was killed in the hands of a German dictator - only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, says his grandfather's actions are "something that I could never do and that I couldn't respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Kuschkawaz, gave the award, led by the Brandwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van says, "I feel very honoured about the part of pareda" and says, "A real man's passion for a real goat is shown in support of a lot of people."
The M.M. spies woke up all night to see 206 Bellots, but instead they found Peppa Pig.
Think about it, you haven't been up all night to see a great 206 dancer, and the main event isn't shown.
There were 13 feet on the main card of the bill from San Jose and the U.S. Channel 5 shows live all night.
In the morning, when Garard Mousaci and Rary McDonald were preparing to face each other, the cover was turned into a pepa pig and killed the United Kingdom audience.
In particular, they were awake until morning, so some people got angry.
On Twitter, a hater described changing children's cartoons as "the same disgusting ridicule".
"It is not appropriate to show such events at 6 a.m. when they were forced to change their children's cartoons," said President Dave Shawarz, in answer to questions from Bellato's senior secretary.
"Peppa The Pig," yeah."
Belato's chairman, Scott Koker, said that the future would be about creating a timetable for UK audiences.
"We may be able to solve this at the time of the refill."
"Then there will be six Sunday mornings and our Sundays, they will not be able to do this until Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it's switched, many messages come later and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technological mistake.
But no, it was a government matter.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to cut it down to five-bits instead of six - as we usually do - in an effort to add more fans.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Delly suffered "in humiliation" because of sexuality.
Olympian Diver Tom Delly said that when he was growing up, he felt humiliated for his sexuality – but it inspired him to succeed.
This 24-year-old said he didn't understand that "everybody isn't like me before he goes to high school."
Lauren Lavern, the first radio 4 Deert Island disc to talk about "hope" sexual rights.
He also said that after the birth of the child, his thinking about his Olympic victory was reduced.
Christie Yong, the regular representative of the event, has been on vacation for several months because of his illness.
In Lavarn's first social event, Deli said he felt "small" more than anyone else, because "the boys' preference was not socially acceptable."
He said, “To this day, the feeling of being a little boy and feeling different has become a reality that has given me the strength and strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove himself to be "something" so that when everyone knows about his sex, they wouldn't be disappointed.
Two times in the Olympics, bronze medalist Victory has become a high profile LGBT publisher, and in Australia this year has used more countries to ask for recognition of homosexuality.
He said he opened his mouth because he thought he was lucky and wanted to "hope" others.
This three-time World Championship says that a man is reading in love -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he saw what in 2013 -- "I was surprised."
Delly married the Oscar winner last year, who was 20 years older than him, and said that there was no problem between him and him.
"When you're so young," she went to the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14, and her father died of cancer three years later -- she said that it was hard to find someone who had seen such a rush in life.
The couple gave birth to a son named Robert Ree Black-Dellie in June, and Delly said that he had changed his "full vision".
He said, "If I were asked last year, I would say, 'I have to win a gold medal' that was my idea.
"Truth, there's something bigger than the Olympic goldsmith.
Robbie is my Olympic goldsmith."
His son's name was his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011.
Daley says his father never admitted that he was going to die, and he has finally asked whether his ticket for London 2012 was valid - because he wanted to stay in the first row.
"I never could have said, 'You won't stay in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when his breath stopped, and he left his last breath and died, and I didn't admit that he wasn't in surgery," he said.
Next year, Delly won the 2012 Olympics and bronze medals.
He said, "This was my whole life's dream of giving my audience a ride to the Olympics, nothing better than that."
It also inspired his first favorite song -- the spring of the Hidar Small -- which was sent to him in the Olympics and which is still tearing down his voice.

You'll be sitting in the bench on the top of the Michaelson on Saturday.
American Phil Michaelson will make a record of his 47th reader cup game on Sunday, but if he doesn't want to make it miserable, he'll have to return his form.
Michaelson, who has played this two-year event 12 times in the record, has sat in the bench instead of Captain Jim Furick on Saturday's Forum and Forsam.
Instead of being at the center of Halchael, which he was playing in the United States, this five-time major won the day of the victory, working for the cheerleader and busy in the racing of his game.
Not always available among drivers at the top of the career, this 48-year-old title is not suitable for Golf National Courses, where long raps often endanger long shots.
And if the course itself is not bad enough, Michaelson, 9th March, faces the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who won their four matches this week along with the Rocky Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans, who have four points at the beginning of the 12 Singles match, can start well, Michaelson's match can be very important.
Furik showed her self-confidence, even though there was not much to say.
"Even today, he fully understands his role, holds hands on my shoulder and says he's ready for tomorrow."
"He has great self-confidence on his own.
He's one of the most famous characters in the past and he's given this team a lot this week.
I probably didn't think they'd play the two games.
I was hoping more, but that's what happened and we thought about moving on like this.
He wants to be on the ground, like everyone else."
The match will be released on Sunday by Michaelson Nick Flander, the largest player in the game cup match.
It can drag the reader's cup into a career that doesn't even fit his personal record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 wins, and seven hips, although Furik says his presence will bring the team back to life.
He said, "That's funny people, Amuda, smart people, people like you, like you're in a team room," he said.
"I think the new players have enjoyed playing with him very much this week, which is very good to see.
He's just giving more than playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big lead can also be invisible.
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a situation can be created in the final days of the Rider Cup, even though it is called Singlse.
Dan's self-discovered match in 1997 in Valdarama, where the Savi Balesteros leadership team won five points with Americans, but only in the narrowest margin won the funding line at 141⁄2-131.2.
"You must remember that there was a big lead in the bilderama; there was a big lead in Brooklyn where we lost, and in bilderama, where I won, only in the middle of the day," Bjorn said, he was seen in the picture, on Friday and yesterday two days at the Golf National in 2018 at class 5-3 win 10-6 in front.
History will show me and the team that it's not over yet.
I'll call you back tomorrow.
Get on the ground and do the right thing.
The board does not end until all points have been raised.
We've got a target, it's trying to win the trophy, and it'll keep our bird's eye on it.
I've always said that I'm looking at my team's 12 players, but I'm also very aware of who we are on the other side of the world."
Bjorn adds, "I am happy about the way our players have done in the hard golf course. "I will never be overconfident.
Tomorrow's a different fight.
Tomorrow's personal performance will come forward, and it's a different thing.
When everything goes well, it's great to be with your partner, but when you're alone in the field, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
This message must be delivered to all players who want to know the best time.
"This time, you have to throw away your mate and get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent will be watching Jim Furik to see what the players have played as a group in person as better playing, with the exception of Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who brought up three points between the four points.
In the "Medine Miracles" in Europe, Furik has gained two experiences of dramatic post-war change in the last days as part of the victory group in Har and in Brooklyn.
He said, "I remember every word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you'd like to get rid of us as fast as Brooklyn and Madina.
When the game ends, there is a lot of pressure in the middle of the games.
We're going to line up like that, and we're going to call the kids like we thought, and we're going to do some magic tomorrow."
Paul Cassie, Justin Roosevelt, John Am, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polttar are responsible for leading Thomas against Europeans, who will face Rory McLary at the beginning of the match.
"I have arranged this group, because I think it will cover everything," Bjorn said about his singles election.
A new warship in Germany has been repatriated
According to local news reports, Germany's newest ever to replace the warships of the former Cold War was to be launched in 2014, but it will not be until at least next year due to the use of the faulty system and snobbling.
According to The Zeit newspaper, the first "Rainland-Falz" of the new Buden-Wartemberg-category was suspended until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the high school project was in trouble due to the delivery problems.
In 2007, the Navy will replace the four boats of the Buden-Wartenberg-category with the old Bremen-Class frigate.
They are known to contain powerful action, anti-aircraft and anti-shipping technologies, such as reused radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include long-term maintenance - new friggets can be removed for a maximum of two years from the port of the country.
Whatever the case, the delay is the amount of the inexhaustible warships - which Germany is supposed to help in the demonstration of power abroad - will be obsolete at the time of the water call, the news of Die Zeit.
Last year's disaster hit F 125 frigates, when the German Navy refused to launch the ship and returned to Hamburg's flower and Vos Shipyard.
This is the first time a ship is returned to the shipyard after the military delivery.
The reasons for the return are very little known, but the German media mention a number of important "software and hardware errors" that will upset the ship in the war.
The software's backbones are particularly important, because the boats of the Buden-Wartemberg-class will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors - half the people of the old Bremen category.
In addition, it was found that the ship would reduce its operational capacity and create obstacles to the future upgrade of the ship's army.
This 7,000-tonne "Rainland-Falz" is thought to be twice as heavy as the German ships used during World War II.
Despite the faulty hardware, the entire project, including the training of the crew, has become a problem.
The first level of 2.2 billion pounds is amazingly reached at 3.1 billion pounds (3.6 billion dollars).
New fryets have become more important in the recent context of the warning of the collapse of Germany's nuclear power.
At the beginning of this year, the German parliament's main defence committee, Hans-Pierre Bartels, admitted that "Motayen's ship is going into the Navy."
This official says the problem has been overdue over time, because no replacement ships have been brought in because of the cancellation of the old ships.
He regrets that no vessel of the Buden-Wartenberg-category was able to join the Navy.
Don't listen to the national trust in the secret life of teenagers.
A new study is being carried out in an estate in the Scottish Province to learn how to use potatoes for food.
It is hoped that the search will shed light on the behavior of this unique flying animal and help save the future.
Research will be carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland on ordinary and soprano Pipesrells and on the Debentons of the Universal Garden of Western Russia.
Special record areas around the area will be important to track the performance of the bats throughout the Mossum.
NHS workers and volunteers also run a running track using portable detectors.
The experts will analyze all the sounds of the recording and adjust the configuration of outgoing calls and let you know what a nation is doing.
Then a map and a report will be created to create different landscape-scale images of their behavior.
NTS's conservation advisor hopes that the results will show which areas of residence are most important and how they are used by each nation.
This information will help determine the benefits of housing management, such as how to protect the soil for the creation of a third country and for the breeding and other related populations.
Over the past century, the number of outpourings in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined greatly.
For building and development, they are among the dangers that damage their sleeping and housing.
Air-based turbines and light-based lights may be dangerous, such as some chemicals from flippers and building devices, and may be dangerous to the attack of clothing aliens.
It's not really blind.
Even so, their ears are more effective than their eyes when it comes to victims' habits at night.
They use an improved echo-location technique to identify dangers and obstacles on the way to Udition.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings throughout the country, 38 major industries and 76,000 hectares of land, have been important to the site.
Ten of them are trained experts who regularly review, visit and ever rescue sleep.
The organisation has also set up the first and only required shelters in Scotland in the Damfriez and Galoy Drive Estate, where the ten most deprived people live in Scotland.
State Manager David Thompson says it is a model area for the islanders.
"There's a good area for thrives," he said.
"There are old buildings, there are many old trees and there are all good homes.
But much more still remains unknown, so what we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about what we need to do to survive them."
He stresses the importance of knowing about the presence of the dam before preserving the property, as it could be killed 400 mothers and children because of the inexhaustible destruction of a mother's residence, and it could be a means of determining the total number of local dams.
It is illegal to have extra-protected animals and to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their habitat.
Scotland's security officer Elizabeth Federal urged the public to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to know about the aliens, and we don't know anything about how many people live."
Ronaldo denied charges of rape and lawyers are going to file a case against the German newspaper
The charges of rape against him are called "false news" and people want to increase their "intellectuality" with his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a case against the German News Magazine of Mirror, who have published the complaint.
This Portuguese and Juventas Foroard was accused of rapeing an American woman at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of having given him $375,000 to remain silent about the case, reported on Friday in Dr. Mirror's report.
A few hours after the claim came out, 33-year-old Ronaldo commented on the report as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million-dollar followers in his Instagram live video.
"No, no, no, no.
What they have said today is a lie," said Balon-de-or-win camera five times.
"They want to increase their contact by using my name.
It's a normal thing.
They want to know my name, but it's a food member.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well." The player said in a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a complaint against Dr. Spigel, whom they have called "a suspiciously suspicious report on privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schartz says that the player should want to be "one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times for moral damage to the seriousness of corruption".
The said event occurred in Las Vegas in June 2009 in a package of Palms Hotel and Casino.
According to a paper submitted to the Nevada Clark County District Court, Ronaldo and Myorga went to the home of a nightclub where he committed felony.
Myorga claimed that Ronaldo was begging Penney after the incident and told him that he was disappointed by "99 percent" "good people", "one percent".
The document claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sexual intercourse, but it was inconsistencies.
Myorga also claimed that he had gone to the police and had taken photos of his injury to the hospital, but then he was able to settle outside the court because he was "feared for retribution" and was afraid to be "degraded in public".
The 34-year-old girl said she wants to re-establish this settlement now because she is mentally disturbed by the alleged incident.
At the time of the crime, Ronaldo Manchester was between joining Royal Madrid from the United States and participating in the 100 million-dollar Italian club Juvey.
Brexit: Losing position as a vehicle manufacturer will "suffer forever" to the U.S.
Minister of Commerce Greg Clarke says that the United Kingdom will be the first to lose its position as the world's first to build a car after Brexit.
He also said it was "concerning" that the United Kingdom told Toyota BBC that if Britain left the U.S. without any agreement, they would temporarily shut down their products in the factory near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
This Japanese car manufacturer said that people could go to work because of the time limit given when they were broken without a contract.
Burnston's factory -- built by Toyota Aris and Avenis -- produced about 150,000 cars last year, with approximately 90 percent of them exported to the rest of the European Union.
The director of Twitter management, Marvin Cook, says in Burnston, "I think if Britain comes out of the U.S. at the end of March, the product can be stopped at our factory."
Honduras, B.M.W. and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about how to manage the EU's other car manufacturers' international trade without any agreement.
For example, BM World said they'd shut down their mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
What car manufacturers say about the main concern is the risk of the supply chain in the case of contract-free flexit.
The twitter product line is based on "Just-In-Time", the U.U.C. and the U.U. suppliers come up with tools every 37 minutes for the ordering car.
If the UK leaves the U.S. on March 29th without any agreement, there may be a break at the border, which can cause a delay in the operation and a crisis in the operation.
The organisation said that the twitter Derbysha plant cannot hold more than one day of valuable inventory, which could cause the product to shut down.
Mr. Clarke says that in the future, the Theresa May Chess Plan "has been properly implemented to avoid such checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want to make the best deal that doesn't only succeed, but it's possible to make future improvements," she says on BBC Radio 4 today.
"Not only the Toyota, but also the words of other producers show that it is very important to continue the success of the Sopley Chain."
Unable to tell how many days the product will be closed, but they have suggested that the competition for the extra cost factor will be reduced and that it can lead to many jobs.
Working in Burnston for 24 years, and the Union of the Plant called Peter Suvalaris said that his members were continuing to express concern: "They don't come back once in my experience.
One government spokesman said: "This is a specific and credible plan for the future with the U."
White House said the trumpet meeting with Rosenstein could be even longer.
In the middle of the trip to the Suprem Court of Nemini Bret Kavanf, Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosestein said the high-level meeting could be held "after another week" on Sunday White House.
Rozstein, an expert on Russia's intervention in the elections, a partner of the trumpet and a connection between Russia and the possible obstacles to the President's trial, called into question the work of Mr. Robert Mueller.
The Trump Deputy Attorney General has been in Washington for the past few months to decide whether he will destroy the Army General and whether he will face the issue of the freedom of the Moeller.
In early this month, Rozstein reported on the possibility of removing the president by using secret Mike to record talks with the New York Times.
Rosstein denied the report.
However, he is going to resign in the face of such a report, saying he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, a meeting with the trumpet was announced on Thursday, when the trumpet was at the United Nations office in New York.
Trump said that he "does not like to discredit Rosestein", but Kavanf and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blazee Ford, both of whom were held as witnesses, was behind the meeting to avoid the hearing of the senate's judicial committee.
Friday, the FBI ordered a week's investigation into the case against Trump Kavanf, for which the entire Senate vote was even longer.
All Sanders' press secretary attended the Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rozstein, he said: "No date is right, it may be this week, it may be another week for all the other issues of the Supreme Court.
But let me show you and I always want to tell the news media."
Some journalists would object to this statement, which Sanders did not review in the White House after 10 September.
Corporal Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders says not to keep a brief because it's not about "showing people" hate for journalists, although he says, "I don't deny that they've done it."
Then he suggested to increase direct communication between the trumpet and the press.
"The current president is asking more questions than any previous president," he said without stating any such evidence: "We have judged that number."
In the future, Sanders says, "Then the news media would be much better if the President of the United States could ask directly than talk to me.
We've been trying very hard to do this and you've seen us do this over the past few weeks and we've been talking to the President of the United States instead of the Press Briefing."
The White House regularly receives the trumpet question when participating in the press conference or during the opening of the opening sessions or during the opening of the opening session.
A single press conference is very low.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why to do unplanned work and sometimes to appear exciting in front of the press.
Health Minister N.H.S. Scotland writes a letter fearing the break-up of EU workers
The Minister of Health of Scotland thanked the European Union workers for their work at NHS and expressed their desire to remain in the future.
Jean Freeman M.P., U.S.A., sent a letter less than six months ago to get out of U.S.
The Scottish government has already promised to metabolize the state-of-the-art application for government services in the EU.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: There is a continuing discussion between Uke and UU over the summer, which can be expected to result in this condition.
However, the United Kingdom is also preparing for a possible unagreed situation.
I know you're all going through a rough time.
That's why I want to remind you again how valuable their contribution is to me, especially the nationality of each member.
Workers from all over the European Union and outside of it have gained valuable experience and skills that have strengthened and improved health services and have benefited the sick and our community.
Scotland is your country and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombian emergency weapon after stabbing his head
Tenesy's Mike Organ said that the tennis State Tigers' lineback Christian Abercrombie was forced to attack Vanderbillt Comodores on Saturday 31-27 after being beaten in the match.
Tennessee State's chief COC Red Read told reporters that the hit was just a short time ago.
Read says, "He's coming to the sideline like this."
Teachers and psychiatrists have given oxygen to Abercrombic as a sideline and are then returned for further testing.
Chris Harris, a Tennessee State official at Nashvile Tenesi, told Chris Harris that the Vanderbit Medical Center was outside the Abercrombie Army.
Harris also says that "not yet known about the type/type of injury" and that he is trying to know when the Tennessee State hits.
After moving from Illinois, a second-year-old student named Red Shirt played the first mouse with Abarcrombie, Tennessee State.
He had five totals before he left the game on Saturday, which included a total of 18 totals.
Foreign creditors have to give more stamps when they buy property in the United Kingdom
When foreign creditors buy new assets in the United Kingdom, they have to pay more stamps and spend more money on homelessness.
This action will enhance the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp will apply to those who do not do so in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury hopes that more money will be available per year to help the homeless to increase their income.
When foreign creditors buy property in the United States, they have to give more stamps - and this extra money will be spent with homeless people, Thessa will announce today.
This step will enhance the efficiency of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters and target high-ranking residents.
This stamp increase will apply to people and organizations who do not do so in the United Kingdom, and the government will need more money to help the homeless.
Charges may be more than three percent of what was lost in the second and second houses two years ago without the current stamp.
Treasury hopes that this will result in an increase of up to £120 million per year.
About 13 per cent of London's newly created total assets have been purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom, for which the price has increased and the situation for the first residents has become more difficult.
Most of the country's foreign regions - especially the capital - have become "unknown city" by foreign Croats.
The new policy came a few weeks after the call from Boris Johnson Stamp Sulk Komanor to buy their first home for the young generation.
He has charged the increase in property prices without using land against large construction agencies, and calls for the cancellation of the mortgage to solve Mrs. Mek's "dwelling problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for the reform of the housing system, which includes rent control and "no-flot" riots.
He wants to give the council more power to create a new home.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would propose my prime ministership in the recovery of the British dream - which should be more beautiful for every new generation.
And his money is to take the broken house down.
The British will always be open to those who want to stay here, work and create life.
However, it is also not clear that foreign and foreign non-governmental organizations that do not live in the United Kingdom will be as easy to buy as hard-working British residents.
Many people have lost their dream of homeowners, and the problem of homelessness is real.
Jack Ross: 'My final dream is to take responsibility for Scotland'
Sanderland Boss Jack Ross said his "excessive desire" was to be managed by Scotland in the future.
The 42-year-old inhabitants of Scotland are currently experiencing the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which is now in third place in the League, three points behind the first team.
In the past months, St. Maryen returned to the Scottish Premiership to come to the light at the summer stage.
"I wanted to play the country as a player.
I've had a B-cap, and until now, "Ros says to the sport sound of BBC Scotland.
"That's when I grew up watching Scotland play with my dad in childhood and he always pulls me back.
If I succeed in running the club, only this opportunity can come."
As Sanderland Manager, Russia's predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Mess, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy, Gus Pojet and Paolo De Canio.
This former Alloa Athletic boss said he did not feel disappointed by the offer of a large club, such as Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, I'm going to be the most successful man in the world, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
The club's structure and facilities make it certainly worthy of the Premier League," she says.
"It's not that easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself as successful if I can get the club back there."
After 15 months as a coking staff in Dumberton, Russia's manager's life is only three years old.
Then he helped to restore the light from the Anonmon and later to convert St. Maryn from the Anonmon Gate to the championship title.
And Ross says he's feeling more self-willed than Clyde, Hartlup, Falcar, St. Miren and Hamilton academically.
He recalls taking responsibility for the light, saying, "It was probably a real Milton."
"I really believed management was better for me than gambling.
It's strange to hear it because I've done it right, lived a lifetime of it, and enjoyed some success.
But the game is hard
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same way about working pressure, then the management seems right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, it's the most voluntary thing I've ever had in my adult life."

Review says Saturday at 5.30 p.m. is the best model for the pint.
The summer's temperature has increased in the UK's muddy feet, but the restoratives have put pressure on China.
In July, sales of bars and bars increased by 2.7 per cent - however, statistics show a decrease of 4.8 per cent in the cost of restaurants.
SGI's business adviser Peter Martin, who compiled the statistics, said: "The expected long-term participation of the UK in the open road and the World Cup is the same in July as last June, when the sale of papayas has increased 2.8 per cent and the sale of restaurants has decreased.
On June, 1.8 per cent of the restaurant industry went worse in the fall in July.
The main drink and the bars have so far been very good and the sale of restaurants has been so bad.
The main food pudding is also hot, but it's not called the sales below, like the restaurants.
It looks like people only go out for a little bit of a drink.
All cans and bars have grown 6.6 per cent this month, and food sales have dropped by three per cent."
Retiring and Atheya analyzer and S.M. Paul Neuman said: "The spring of the end of April is still continuing.
The impact of climate and large social or sporting events on the market outside the home remains the most important.
It is not surprising that the restorative groups are in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent reduction in annual sales will be particularly painful.
Food operators can't come from long and hot summers in a bad time, and the mild climate of August will only tell you if it will bring some relief."
In July, with the new invention, the total sales growth in restaurants was 2.7 percent, reflecting the decrease in sales in brand rolling outs.
The U.S. has collected and analysed the performance data from the 47 operating groups of the Peech Tracker Industry Cells Monitor, a coffer from the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, with a total of over 9 million pounds, and an established art standard.
Each of the five children has a private social media account that they keep with their parents
The review revealed that one in five children - some 11 years of age - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
In comparison with the 20,000 high school students, the "Copy Insta" page has been expanded
The news shows fear that sexual content is being posted
Hundreds of girls John's students say there's an "main" account to show their parents
One of the five children -- someone's hiding from 11-year-olds -- is creating a social media account.
In comparison with the 20,000 high school students, "Copy Insta" -- the image share's site Instagram -- accounts have been seen to grow rapidly.
The news shows that sexual content is being posted.
Hundreds of young Johns students said they had a transparent "main" account to show their parents, as well as to hide.
A mother who has seen her 13-year-old daughter's hidden site has seen a young man calling out "Screw me" to others.
The study of Digital Awarness U and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) shows that between 11 and 18 years of age, there are two 40 percent profiles that have been recognised as part of a secret account.
H.M.C. Chief Mike Buchann says: "It's worrying that it's difficult to create places that parents and teachers can't find on-line."
Elid Doyle Scottish Athletic Board Becomes "Vous For Athletics"
Elid Doelle was elected a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as an executive manager at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Duel Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman Yan Bet described this step as a poor opportunity for athletes to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Scottish, UK and the world Athletics community have great respect for Elid and we are sure that he will benefit from the Scottish Athletics Board," Bet said.
Doyle says: "I am interested in working as a voice for athletes and I hope that I can really help Scotland play and move it forward."
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals with 200 metres and 400 metres in the Atlantic in 1996 and is now a regular guest in BBC, has stopped his march after a tragic Ischemic attack.
He writes on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said I could tell how long I'd be able to get better.
It was hard work, but now I've learned to be healthy, to walk again, and to start again today!
Thank you for the inspirational message!"
The Internet is divided into two sets of ads in the column pump compared with the mother and the cow
A column pump company shares the internet's opinion with an advertisement to compare the mother's milking cows.
What is called "the first silent column pump in the world," the food technology organization LV published a fun music video to show the new pump the freedom of modern mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing with a song full of cows, including Lirik: "Yes, I do my own milk, but I don't have a leg" and "if anyone sees it, it's not a pet, it's my stomach."
Corass continues: "Fuck and push, push and push, I'll eat the children, push and push, I'll pray my friends' milk."
However, the advertisement, which has been released on the company's Facebook page, has created an online debate.
The video was mixed by viewers in 77,000 views and shows, many say it highlights the "frightness" of dual art.
"The use of cows in the advertising of this product is a very bad decision.
They need to be pregnant and give birth to babies, as we do for milk production, the difference is that their children are being stolen from them within a few days of birth," one wrote.

Another comments: "It seems to be disappointing for both mother and child.
But why don't they use the breast pump for the mother who keeps her baby safe?"
Another says, "The advertising is so unpopular."
Others stand by the ad, one woman admits that the song has been her "rejoicing".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I ate the baby, I'd take one.
I think it's too hot when pumping.
The ad is kind of crazy, but I got it right.
It's an innovative product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a funny advertisement that he's making for mothers who pump (usually in their workplace or in their toilet) and think of themselves as "goose."
This advertisement does nothing to praise or criticize Deary's art."
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they all danced with the pump hidden in their bra.
The advertisement is based on the idea that many women feel like cows when pumping their breast.
Although the LVV pump is completely silent, it does not have a tube or tube and fits beautifully in the nursing bridge, which also allows women to move, keep the baby on the phone, and even be outside.
Anna Balarin, Mother's partner and I CD, said: "LV Pumps should be a bipolar food that should start bold and excitingly.
Drawing a parallel picture of the female and the twins, we want to highlight at the stop pumping and all of its challenges in the spot, revealing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring in a fun and related way.
LVP has not been the first news ever.

Some migrant children were taken to a camp on a quiet Texas border
The number of children in detention has increased, although the monthly border has remained unchanged, because the harsh rules and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to keep children close to their parents.
Traditionally, most Spaniards themselves are afraid to lose their ability to live in their own country to inform immigrants and children without a paper.
The risk is growing in June when the federal authorities announce that the possible sponsors and other adult members of their family will have to put together fingerprints and share the information with the immigration authorities.
Last week, a former immigration and sulk official testified before the Matthew Albenz Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked for children's support.
The Agency has subsequently reported that there is no past history of 70 per cent of those arrested.
"Approximately 80 percent of the sponsors' or sponsors' families are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are indictees.
That's why we're looking for them," Nister Albenz said.
In an effort to bring children back to society more quickly, officials introduced some new rules, including a month of detention to be brought before the court, which was 60 days ago.
Many people will not be personally present at the video conference call when they come to the immigration judge for honor.
Those who are considered unworthy of salvation will be expelled quickly.
According to the shelter workers, and in recent months according to reports published by the system, children are more likely to have more anxiety or frustration, which could lead to a violent attempt to escape.
Supporters said that these concerns are more intense in the larger centres, such as Tornillor, where children are more concerned, more likely to be ignored, because of its size.
They also said that if children are not mentally prepared or are not given enough time to move away from the center, many may be able to increase the amount of time they have already suffered.
U.S., French and Turkish forces have urged Syria to move immediately
Addressing the U.N. General, the Foreign Minister has called on Syrian refugees to return to Syria, although the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moylem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister of the country, says that foreign armies are inexorably on the ground in the fight against terrorism, and "We will take the appropriate measures."
"They have to leave now without conditions," he tells the student.
Moylem stressed that Syria "is almost the end of the war against terrorism", where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He says Damascus will continue the war "until all Syrian soil is cleared" against both terrorists and "unlawful foreign presence".
There are nearly 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria, against President Bashar-Al-Assad, and the Kurdish army and the Syrian Arab for major training and advice.
There are more than 1,000 French military members in this war-torn country.
Moalem said in the refugee question that the situation is appropriate for their return, and he is responsible for "spreading illegal fear" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and human organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're political about the entire human problem"
The United States and the European Union have expressed concern that Syria will not be given any reorganisation until the end of the war between Assad and the opponents.
U.S. policymakers have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey has brought about a further political debate in order to create a buffer zone in the Idlib's last major rebellion.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a major attack by the Russian-backed Syrian army in the region, where three million people live.
Moalem, however, stressed that the agreement has a "clear time limit" and he expressed hope that this military move Al-Qaeda-Assisted Nossar will work against the Gihadites, who will be "defeated."
The United Nations Ambassador Staffon De Mistura has soon expected to convene a new committee of government and opposition members to prepare drafts of the war-to-war constitution and to make the way out for elections.
Moalem expressed his commitment to the participation of the Syrian government, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing existing constitutional paragraphs", and he warned against unintended action.
Why beat the trumpet in the second round
In this argument, Trump 2020 will win the re-election, as many liberals may hope that the blessing and the calendar will soon end.

Of course, in contrast to anything else on TV, Washington can determine the future of Ro-Five, whether immigrant families can reunite and wait for the world economy to happen.

It's no surprise that the 17th vote in Pennsylvania is flying, as two candidates are fighting for the return of the Congressonal District.
The recently redesigned city of Pittsburgh District Pitts has brought Democratic Representative Connor Lamb to fight - who won another district in a special election last fall.
Lamb is fighting against the Republican Keith Rothfas, who is currently representing the 12th district of the old Pennsylvania, many of which are part of the 17th district.
In January, Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts are constitutionally well-formed according to the Republicans, which has redesigned the map.
This new 17th district electorate has competed between the Democratic Campaign Committee (Decis) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
The 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, in March, received a long contact after winning a special election.
For more than a decade, this approach was in the hands of the Republicans and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political teachers are continuing to push the Democrats a little further.
To support the U.S. China, El Salvador is sentenced to imprisonment, then returned
Cottologists have noted that Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, a bit behind Washington.
Mr. Trump Panaman President Juan Carlos Verela held a warm meeting in June 2017, and he also had a hotel in Panama, but the participants removed the tromp organisation's manager.
In a statement at the beginning of the month, foreign counterpart Hydar Nort said that officials from the office decided to bring back the U.S. leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to Taiwan "the recent decision not to acknowledge Taiwan".
However, only El Salvador was punished, which received nearly $140 million in 2017 for drug control, development and financial assistance.
The proposed fine, which included financial assistance and a specific visa ban, could become painful for this Central American country because of its high unemployment and loss of life.
Along with the progress of the internal meeting, North American and Central American officials have suspended a high-level conference to prevent migrants from entering the United States last year as a step towards security and economic prosperity.
But in mid-September Nagad, senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the convention, which resulted in an effective end to El Salvador's sentence.
Co-intelligants said Vice-President Mike Pens will give a speech at this conference, which was scheduled for mid-October to notify the administration of imports.
And American ambassadors from three countries have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new strong message or punishment from Washington.
Mr. Bolton was not prepared to comment on the statements made by three American officials who had been discussing the internal issue of the lack of a White House's name.
Their speech was confirmed by an external analyst and he also refused to publish a name.

The next incident could be an accident with a special report by Robert Mullar on Mr. Tromp's possible limitation in law, which now has sufficient evidence in the public record.
During the election, Mr. Tromp's involvement with Russia has been reported to be on the way to investigate Mr. Mullar.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility, just as he is preparing to go back to the voters and possibly to the jury with his associates.

History's path often turns like this, and it's always driven, sometimes delayed, by the constant speed of democracy.
America's history has also turned this way.
What should we do if Mr. Trump's deputy, Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, is out of the question that will determine the fate of Mr. Mullor's investigation.
Since it was published last year, Rosenstein has been in danger that he secretly suggested recording the president and assumed his own disability.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news of the Times is false.
"What if our campaign against Bret Kavanf starts with an F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or unjust - or even if he is found innocent in the Supreme Court despite a credible charge of sexual assault and false testimony?

Graham Dorans of Rangers hopeful before the Epid Viena War
On Thursday, the Rangers will play with their own Epid Viennese, and at the beginning of Amas, if they win a great deal against the Australians, they will have a good chance to qualify from the G Group of their European League.
Because of the kicking in the hand, the midfielder Graham Dorans Mossum's first game played in the game with a 2-2 rounds, but he believes they can get to a good place by relying on this result.

Federal Consuls want a death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
New York's Federal Consuls are calling for a death penalty for Sifalo Sipov, who suspected that he was involved in a terrorist attack in New York to kill eight people and that no one was punished after 1953.
It is alleged that 30-year-old Zipov attacked his bicycle on the way to Lower Manhattan in October, so that bike riders and passengers would go back.
Consuls must prove, according to the notes given in the New York South District, that Sipov has killed eight people "willfully" and "willly" severely affected them.
According to the court, it is sufficient for both of them to execute the death penalty.
A week after the attack, a federal Grand jury filed 22 charges against Siepov, which included eight charges of murder, usually involving organised crime, and charges of violence and car destruction.
The councillors say that "adequate planning and advance direction" is needed as the "sanctioned, cruel and corrupt" attack has occurred.
"Syflo Habylewish Sipov, whose family and friends are injured, damaged and damaged by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lorra Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Elise, Harnan Feruchi, Harnan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Mendoza," notes by Intent State.
Travelers from five Argentinas among the victims.

The two of the Rosenberg couples were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953.
The resident of Uzbekistan has not issued any form of discipline, reports from the Court.

The police said they also asked for the ISIS flag in his hospital.
He's been suing himself for 22 counts.
A David Patton of the Federal Public Defenders of Cyprus says they are "clearly disappointed" in the decision of the Consul.
Patton says, "We believe that the decision to search for a death sentence will be longer than a request for a life sentence."
Sipov's legal team had already applied for the death penalty for Consuls.
Senator Tory says Nigel Farez should be held responsible for the Brexit Review.
Nigel Farez promised to "attack the army" in protest at today's Tori.
The former prime minister said that politicians have been "stretched out of Euroseptics" -- when the MP said that he should be held responsible for discussing with the U.S.
Conservative leader Peter Burmingham's sister Burmingham's campaign said that if Mr. Farez Brexit were secretary, the United Kingdom would already be "outside the U.S.".
However, Mrs. May has once again become clear to keep her deep-separated officials in one place, when she joins another Brexit-Resistant toris in another Brexit-Resistance protest.
One of these Brexit-supported Brexit-Resistants and the U.S. attack is driving the hammers to keep the deal in the right direction.

Mr. Solihale's sister said at the Live Mins Live meeting that she wanted 'Chuck Chess'.
He suggested that Mr. Farez should be co-worked and that he should be responsible for the discussion with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have gone out into it," he said.
Wellinboro's MP also says, "I'll support the Brexit, but I need the paychecks."
In Utah, he told his opposers: “We did not fight for the world to survive
We want to make our own laws in our own land .
After the vote in 2016, Mr. Sister has been able to change people's opinion. "British people want to stay in exchange for EU - this is a completely false idea."
In Tory Brexit's supporter Andre Jenkins was also at the campaign, which told reporters: 'I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Shakers will not vote for the general public's dislikes, the opponents will not vote for it, and also the people and the active actors who have brought us here.
Move the sugars and try to listen."
For Mrs. May, he also said: "The Prime Minister is thinking about where she should keep her promise."
At Mr. Farez's meeting, he said that if politicians were to be unfaithful to the decision of the 2016 referendum, they should be forced to understand the ‘opposition’.
"It is now a matter of belief among politicians," he said.
They are trying to be unfaithful to the Brassites, and We shall say to them: 'We will not let you escape, if we do.'
He also said to the encouraging people: ‘I want politicians who are trying to cheat on Braxit to face the situation.
“We are running the armies of those who won our brigade, and we will not rest until we have become a single, independent, proud kingdom.”

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would think deeply about applying for the presidency after the November vote.
Boston Globe reports that this Massachusetts Democrat is a city in the West Massachusetts City on Saturday, which is about its future in the future.
Warren, who often criticises the President's trumpet, fought against G and P State candidate Jeff Diell in the November elections, who was co-chair of the Massouchets campaign in 2016.
He is currently discussing that he will be able to compete with the trumpet in the 2020 election.

It was a difficult day, because Valteri fought all week and worked like a real gentleman.
The group is doing a great job first," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump was ridiculed by Senator Diane Finnstein for not putting forward the letter of Christian Blazi Ford against the charges of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court.
Instead of speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president spoke directly about the subject, he said that people's "low and worthless and false" mentality was reflected in what was happening in the scene.
"This is something that could have happened and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate for weeks, you'll see anger when you see low and low and low and false people," he said.
"When they see the data being lost, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
Oh, I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you throw it?
Remember his answer... did you dump a document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't throw it away.
Hey, wait a minute.
We're stuck...no, we didn't," he says, copying the senator.
In July, the letter was sent to Ford Finnstein, describing the charges against Kavanf, and the letter was closed in September -- but Finnstein denied the letter from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't do anything," the Finnstein Committee said, "The Hill's report.
"He told me to keep it secret and I kept it secret according to his word."
But he didn't dare speak to the president, he said at a Saturday night meeting: "What I said was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen a worse body language than that."

Look at low mentality, dignity, not forced to hurt anyone, not forced to change power and control," the president said to the media.

Hundreds of air traffic controllers assured the survivors of the plane's flight from the earthquake for their lives
A Indonesian air traffic controller with hundreds of passengers is honored to help fly and die.
On Friday, more than 800 people died on the island of Sulawesi in a large earthquake, and many people are missing.
The area is falling repeatedly in the company, and people are trapped in the ravages of the ravine.
But despite the fear of all their fellow workers, 21-year-old Anthonyas Guanawan Pulu Mutiyara did not flee the control tower of Cisse Al-Zufri Airport.
From him, he confirmed that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then in Ranwei, could fly safely.
Then he slammed the control tower down because it was broken.
Then he died at the hospital.
Indonesia Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirite said that his decision may have saved some lives, reports from Australia's ABC News.
We set up a helicopter from Balykpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, this morning the helicopter died before it arrived.
"Our hearts have been broken by hearing this," he added.
Already, the government's fear that the number of deaths could not be thousands has been reduced by disaster response agencies, reports Dongala, Sigi and Butong.
"The number of deaths is supposed to be increasing, because there are arrests below the end of many bodies that have not yet been reached," said the agency's spokesman, Old Nugroho.
A six-metre-high hole leads to the destruction of the lilac where people will be buried on Sunday.
Rescue and assistance are being provided through military and commercial flights.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, says Sky News: "Mordeh comes in ambulance every minute."Mordeh comes in ambulance every minute.
No clear water can be found.
Small shops are all over the place."
In Indonesia, the head of the International Red Cross, Jean-Galfand CNN, says: "Indonesian Red Cross is taking help to the living quickly, but we don't know what to see there.
It's already sad, but the situation can get worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia went to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military members: "I ask you to stay in your day-to-night rescue work.
What are you doing?" CNN's report.
In the beginning of this year, Indonesia's Lambo has been struck by earthquakes that have killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Newigni reported an undiscovered aircraft crash
When one of the aircraft crashed into the Pacific Legion in Micronesia, they reported that 47 passengers and workers were rescued from the deep plane, and now they say there is a missing person.
Air Newgini says in a report Saturday evening that a man cannot be found.
The airline reported that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find it.
The airline immediately refused to disclose details such as the passport and nationality of the trip.
After attempting to land at the airport, the plane's crew helped to rescue passengers and workers.
The officials reported Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers are in the hospital on Saturday, and they are all stable.
There's still nothing clear about why this incident happened.
Airline and the United States Navy have both said that the plane is going to land before arriving in Ranwey.
Several observers thought the plane was gone to Runway.
The American traveler Bill Jens said the plane was very low.
"That's a very good thing," said Janes.
Jens says that he and others reached the early entrance of the deep.
He said the plane workers were screaming in fear and he had a little scratch on his head.
The U.S. Navy reports that near a jet is also helping rescue crews working in Sarajevo, bringing people to land before they land 30 metres (100 ft) of the plane.
According to the aviation security network, 111 people have died on the PNG-registered airline for the past two decades, but there has been no accident of the Air Neuginin.
Analysts have been able to repeat the time when the woman was burned.
In 2014 a woman in Mississippi filed a case on Saturday for the prosecution of the accused for murdering a woman.
U.S. Departmental Analyst Paul Raolet has witnessed several hours as an expert on the analysis of research.
He describes to the jury how he uses his cell phone records, 29-year-old Assami Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, who made the incident of her death on the night of her death.
Raolet said he recovered a number of cellphones, which suggests that Telis and Chambers were together on the night of death, which was against Telis's earlier dubious report.
It is reported that at the time his cell phone was with Chambers, although he claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police Sanford spoke with him.
Sanford said on Saturday that he wasn't in town last night.
When Consuls ask whether Telis is telling the truth that she was on a Sanford's truck that night, Sanford answers that "it's a lie, because his truck was in Nashaville that day."
Another inconsistency is that Telis said he knew Cambers two weeks ago.
The cellphone record says they only knew each other for a week.
Raolet says that shortly after the death of Chambers, Telis deletes text, call and contact information from his phone.
"He's just taking her out of life," Hally says.
The case's final argument was filed on Sunday.
The judge says the case is expected to go to the jury the next day.

Another bastard?
New York Nancy filed a complaint against a couple after the "distinctive" text.
A mother has received misleading text from a New York woman who is suing a married couple for a different divorce to be called "a raisin. "
The couple refused to be discriminating and sought a lawsuit against the "Julum" charge.
Two children's mother, Linci Plasco-Falxman, expressed disappointment after her first day of work in 2016 when she learned that Gigel Morris was a new babysitter.
Ms. Plasco-Falxman wrote a text message to her husband.
Anyway, she sent Miss Morris twice instead of sending her husband.
Later, when she realized her mistake, she kicked out Plasco-Falxman Miss Morris, who said her former sister-in-law, who was an African-American, had hoped for a Filipino, a report from New York Post, because of his bad conduct.
Miss Morris is given a mine one day and is then sent home to a new call.
Morris is now trying to get damages against the couple and wants compensation for six months as $350 a day, even though he was first hired as a housekeeper without any agreement.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do that," he told the post Friday, and he added, "I know it's different."
The couple said against the claim that the reason for evicting Morris was the fear that he could not be trusted after being accused of him.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent.
He's not a characterist.
We're not a discriminating couple," says Joel Plasco.
"But will you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have misused, even if it is wrong?
Your beloved child?
Say it."
Plasco said his wife only gave birth two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"Do you want to go against someone like that?
It's not very good," said the banker.
In view of the ongoing case, the Social Media Court strongly condemned the couple's behaviour and arguments.
The Edmonton publisher expressed fears that readers might not be able to relate to their favorites, published in a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was accepted, says about the letter: "It's hard to say what will happen to her mind for the first time before publication.
It's really fun to know after the great success of Paddingon.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write children's books, said he was hopeful to refuse his work and said that he had the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year.
Paddington, whom he described as "the most important member of our family", said that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quiet man, and he wasn't a good man," he said.
"Then Paddington was so real to him that your child succeeded: you're proud of him, even though you don't have a role in it.
I think that's how he saw the little success of Paddington.
Although it was the fruit of his own creation and imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her way to death and I had to say goodbye to her phone.
Soon after the landing, his daughter was taken to Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nod regularly called saying it was very bad, and she won't live without understanding," says Mrs. Ednan-Lapperoz.
"Then I got Nad's phone and found out she was going to die in two minutes and I was forced to release her on the phone.
And that's what I do.
I said, "Tashie, Darling, I love you very much.
I'll come to you very soon.
I'll come to you.
The doctors gradually stopped working on his body and went outside.
He died a while ago and then it all stopped.
There was no way but to wait on my seat, you know.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was mixed up with family and people.
I had to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapperoz, crying out at the death of her daughter, took her by flight along with other passengers - she was unique for this difficult situation.
No one knows," he said.
"I bowed my head, and there was tears in my eyes.
It's impossible to describe it, but I was the partner of Nade's unfavorable suffering on the plane.
He needs my love and compassion.
I know how good he was.
The pained woman posted a card to stop her suicide
Two women who have lost their love of people in suicide work to stop the suicide of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphreys posted cards with inspirational messages from the Welsh Bridge and phone numbers where people can call for help.
Miss Davis' son died of depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I represent," he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, says his son was a promising boss and had the right to laugh.
"Everyone knew him for his laugh.
Everyone used to say, "The house is bright with his smile."
Anyway, he quit his job before he died because he was really going dark.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, aged 11, was found dead.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm still worried that this will lead to trouble."
Ms. Davis card says, "Tell everyone that there is someone you can talk to can be a friend.
Don't sit still. You need to talk.
Miss Hamphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davis for many years, lost his 15-year-old partner Mark after his mother died.
"He never said that his heart was bad or he was poisoned or anything," he said.
"I made some changes with him two days ago.
"Christmas was a very bad day - when the children opened their presents, they didn't even look at them."
He said his death had a huge mental impact on them, but it had to be cut off: "It has created a huge space in the family.
He broke us apart.
But we have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanf's future inquiry into F.B.I.
"I thought if we could give him what he wanted -- because the investigation is limited, the opportunity is limited -- we might be able to bring something together," Mr. Flack said on Saturday, and he said he was also afraid that the committee might be "defeated" in the face of this biased behaviour.
Why did Mr. Kavanf and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their obligation is related to time.
On 6 November, only five weeks left in the middle of the elections - if Republicans are expected to fail, their efforts will be weakened to find people they love in the country's highest court.
George World Bush is calling the senators and testing them to support Mr. Kavanf working in the White House under Mr. Bush, through which Mr. Bush became acquainted with his wife Assal, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after F.B.I. reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
At least 50 votes in Mr. Kavanf's Senate are still not clear, which will ensure him in the Supreme Court if Vice-President Mike Pens is broken.
Number of members of North Korea under Kim's "compass"
Seven years ago, after Kim Jong-un came into power, North Korea's troops were reduced, a South Korean law enforcement official said.
Park Beong-seg, quoted the Ministry of Integration of South Korea as saying that last year there were 1.127 - 2,706.
Mr. Park says the root cause of hard-to-restricted control between North Korea and China and the repression of human traffickers.
Piojiang has not commented on this.
A large number of refugees from North Korea were granted citizenship in South Korea.
Sun reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them fled China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross a very secure, uninhabited zone (MJD) between two Koreas.
China does not consider these refugees to be refugees, but considers them to be illegal immigrants and often forces them to return to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea - those still in the war - have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the current month, the leaders of the two countries met for discussion in Pyongyang, which was at the center of the peace-keeping of the temple.
This was followed by a historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they unanimously agreed to work to create a nuclear-weapon-free Korean island.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Deputy Prime Minister Ree Yong-ho blames the US ban on progress.
In a speech to the United Nations in New York, Mr. Rey said, "If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation we will never get rid of ourselves in the first place."
Nancy Pelosi Bret Kavanf called "histeria-gristed" and said she was unable to perform her duties in the Supreme Court.
The House's few leaders, Nancy Pelosi Suprem Court, called Bret Kavanoff "histeria-gristed", and said that he is usually inappropriate in the performance of his duties in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi comments on a visit to the Texas Tribune Festival on Saturday, Austin.
On Thursday, Pelosi told the Senate jury about his response to Kavanf's testimony, "I couldn't imagine that if any woman had ever done such a thing, she would have been called "histeria-gristed".
Kavanf Zorre denied the claim that he had sex with Dr. Christine Blazi when they were both young.
During his initial speech, Kavanf was moved to talk about his family and high school life and breathe.
He clearly denounced the democrats in the committee and accused them of being a "democratic and social character" organized by Liberals, claiming that Hillary Clinton was doing this out of anger at the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi says he believes Kavanf's testimony proves he's not worthy of the Supreme Court, because he's proved to be biased against the Democrats.
"I think he's proved himself unworthy of the statement he made and of the way he spread out to Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When he was asked if Kavanf would bless him if he was sure and if the democrats had won the majority in the house, Pelosi would say no.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't speak to Congress or FB, he's not only eligible for the Supreme Court, he's also not entitled to the Court he's in," Pelosi said.
Kavanf is currently the judge of the Circuit Court of Apples of the CDC.
Pelosy adds that as a Democrat, he is concerned that Kavanf Afordable would oppose the act or Ro V. Wed, because he himself is a conservative judge.
In his confirmation, Kavanf has avoided changing some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be that histeria-gross will go to court and tell us, 'Isn't it great,' says Pelosi.
And women should control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years after, and she can't cry.
"We cry when we get angry," Miss Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's crazy, what do you say?"
He also said, "A woman in charge helped me a lot, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but she chose the idea that when she started crying when she was angry, the one she was talking to would tell her, "You may think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
Then he went on.
I thought it was amazing."
The tears are partly an expression of anger, because they are largely victims of misunderstanding.
My first job was a strong memory, a man-chief office, where I once saw myself crying in incredible anger, an old woman held my scarf -- that was a good manager I always feared -- who took me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you."
Patrick Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman of Colorado, worked with him when he was elected president of Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on board a manky business abroad and left for a no-good job, he was deeply disappointed by Miss Schroeder that he had no reason to be a candidate for his own president.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he laughs after 30 years.
"The other seven candidates are already fighting, and no one else wants to.
One said to him, "Sno White and Seven Palms."
He was behind the tax collection at the start of the campaign, so he pledged that he would not name the race without collecting $2 million.
It was a war of defeat.
He saw that if a supporter gave a man $1,000, he was only given $250.
"Do they think I'll get a price cut?" she said surprised.
When he announces that he is not running official propaganda, he is deeply moved by his feelings and appreciation for his supporters, and he is disillusioned with the financial system, which is a source of disillusionment to the system, with the exception of representatives, and becomes ill with sexual diversity.
"You might think that I've had a snooze," recalled Miz Shroder.
"You might think that Klinex is my corporate sponsor.
Remember, I thought, where would they bury me?
"He's crying?"
How this commercial war in the United States can go to Beijing
The U.S. trade war was the first summit of the war, and when the war ended, the two countries could benefit from the Beijing long term, like experts.
President Donald Trump, U.S. President of the United States, first alerted China to the solar panels, expats and aluminum, which are the beginning of the year.
The most significant response is this week, when the total imports from China amounted to nearly half of the total, which amounted to nearly $200 billion (150 billion pounds).
Beijing has taken revenge as usual -- recently they have increased from five to ten percent of US dollars over 60 billion dollars.
China's eyes have decided to fight, and the world's second largest economy cannot be seen soon.
The claim to kill Washington in the wake of the claim, however, will be very humiliating for China's President Shi Jinping in public to lower his head to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play cards correctly, the pressure on the US trade war can reduce interdependence and help China in the long term.
"Any rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing could lead to a financial downturn in both countries is far more dangerous than the idea of the Wakybhal building," thought tank agency, a co-sponsored researcher by the Center for New American Security, Abigail Grace, who is working on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return its refugees, the Foreign Minister says.
Syria says they have requested the country ready to return to the will of the refugees, and the seven-year war has taken place.
While the United Nations is speaking in general, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mujalem said the country is improving its situation.
"The progress made in the fight against terrorism is stable and secure today," he said.
The government has continued to reinstate the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists.
All the situations now are appropriate for people who are forced to leave the country because of terrorism and the relative economic situation.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million have fled the Syrian country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people from the country need human assistance.
Al-Mohalem says the Syrian government welcomes all assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he also insists that no conditional assistance will be accepted or that the country that helps the rebels will not be helped.

We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good leader.

I love these 12 people and they're proud to be their leaders.
You have to honor them.
We didn't get up in the game."
Modern Red Stream: Pinellas, Manati, and Sarasota decrease density
The new report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in the density of the Red Stream in the Tampa Pre-Sea region.
According to the F.W.C., Pinales, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kolier County have seen the flowering situation of the pacifier, which is a low density.
The red stream's flower ranges from north Pinellas to southern Lee County, some 130 miles away.
It's almost 10 miles from the Hillsboro County arrow, but it's down compared to last week.
The Red Stream has also been observed in the Pasco County.
Last week, the average density of the valley and the arrow in the Pinellas County, the Helseboro County suburb, the manatee county density, the Sarasota county suburbs and the distance, and the Charlotte County mean density, the Lee County suburb and the colliery county density were reported.
Penellas, Manati and Sarasota, Lee and Kolya County are still experiencing breathing problems.
Last week there was no respiratory problem from North-West Florida.
