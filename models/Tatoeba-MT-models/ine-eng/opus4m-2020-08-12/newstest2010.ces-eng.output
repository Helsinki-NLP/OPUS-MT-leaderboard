Barack Obama gets the Fourth American President of the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth American President in history.
Diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with Michelle's wife and have plenty.
First, he welcomes the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with five members of the committee who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The president's couple then have a planned meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonjo.
In the afternoon, the visit will be followed by a solemn ceremony to which Obama will take the prestigious award.
He gets it as the fourth American president, but only the third one who gets the price directly in the office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will be talking about the Afghan war when it comes to winning the prize.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that the price is being taken as a president who is currently fighting in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago increased by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of his criticisms.
Obama also receives gold medals, diplomas and cheques for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to give for charity, but he hasn't decided on a particular charity yet.
The President's programme will then be set up on a banquet, where he will also be the Prime Minister and the other 250 guests invited, except for the Norwegian king and the Queen.
Obama's been building himself more durable from the start to the price.
He said, for example, that he felt he didn't deserve it entirely.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said he was "calling for action."
Nature defender accused of extortion
The Litomeric Police accused the President of the Civil Society of the Lithuanian Nature Protection Society of expulsion.
In a few cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction management, demanding money from investors for his own benefit, said Litomerian police spokesperson Alena Romová.
The President of the Lithometric Society of Nature's Guardians is Lubomir Studnička.
He's in prison now, threatening him for up to three years.
Class containers Brno doesn't smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can order packs of drinks, in the south of the village, you will again meet class containers at every step.
What about Brno?
There to make a few minutes before you find the right ashtray.
I don't want to claim that the waste in Brno would never be sorted.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the Republic, the advisors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the laundry league of the classification of waste not only that as citizens here we can still throw only paper, glass and plastic into class containers, but above all the number of ashes on such waste.
Have you ever tried to dump PET bottles in a collection basket in the center, for example?
It's a finished lump, mostly it wants time and nerves.
The only place I've ever met is in the Moravian Square opposite the Potrefene Husse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think I'm gonna get a damn thing.
Not that there is no honey in other parts.
A number of my friends don't like the waste.
From the lens.
They have it far to the ashtray.
I don't admire them.
After the celebration, I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored ashes on Kounic Street.
Luckily, I ran into the wrong place by the way.
However, the waste ran out of him.
It's still the center of Brno, which may represent the city the most, right?
But ecology and some aesthetics are probably of little interest to the Brno Socialists.
They'd rather buy the city a hockey extraliga, which would shame us all over the Republic than buy a few more containers and offer other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad that I could confirm with official statistics after I was surfing the Internet.
According to ECO-KOM, Brno is really the highest in the whole of the South Moravian region.
Parobkov's budget took money on pensions and hospitalization
After the left has added to the opinion of the government to farmers or officials, the budget must not be money on pensions, sickness or construction savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international court disputes.
It will create problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists advocated a rise in some groups, they relied on the government to lend additional loans to sensitive expenditure, pensions or ill health. "It's just putting problems in the future, putting mines," says Janota.
The money borrowed is as high as possible, and sometimes it has to come back.
He doesn't have much choice to make.
If it does not reduce social benefits or costs on the way to the state, it must raise taxes.
All that she now added to: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later on, and their kids.
Retirement or sickness, from which the account has disappeared 1.8 billion, do not have to worry people, they will get it.
However, at the price of the state being more indebted, the next year will not only miss 163 billion, but more.
In spite of this, I am trying to raise the debt of Minister Janota as quickly as possible and together with him the cost of interest.
The State will need money at its refund and will no longer be sufficient to unduly increase VAT or reduce motherhood, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
As a result of money transfers in favour of several groups of voters, the next year will also miss five billion to build railways and railways.
It is mainly the already complex and disaggregated sections that are not redesigned and, where appropriate, reduced.
Most of all, it's not free of charge.
This means delaying or halting thirty major buildings, also threatening to draw European money, the spokesperson of the Karel Hanzelk Ministry of Transport warns.
The ČSSD proposed that the loss of money would solve the cash loss – it would reach the dividend ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the majority and from which the transport fund will be raised.
The problem is, the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it's no longer a poor source.
Last year, ČEZ joined the budget of 18 billion.
The elimination of environmental damage from dividends shall be paid annually, the pension account shall be supplemented or served as a reserve for future pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 per cent of GDP under EU rules.
But that doesn't stop the carnival movement.
Nearly three billion have been spent in the budget for various damages to victims of Communism and crimes or for spending on court disputes, even on construction.
If you don't have that money, it's not sure.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, says Janet.
Then the minister will have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing from the already proposed two-billion-dollar State Treasury project, which is intended to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities are missing.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister didn't find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone, on which the user will press the only button to switch between different operating systems.
Discovered plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile move to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely what the U.S. company VMware is looking for, focusing primarily on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We'll allow you to run two user profiles on the phone at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at one and at the same time, Srinavas Krishnamurti of VMware pointed out in a conversation for the magazine Computerworld.
He was presented in November last year and was first introduced a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has successfully conducted a smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were running alongside.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full flow.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones, and devices should be available to customers during 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains affects hotels
The big meetings don't just worry about crockery tractors.
The lack of snow also reflects people from the booking of ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
This is why free rooms are still available in Krkonos for all winter periods, including Christmas and Silver.
We have a big visit on our website.
People go through bids, find prices, but they're afraid to order.
And if they call us, they are immediately asking if we think Christmas will be on the snow or on the mud this year," said Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants a wild stay in Spindler's Mill exactly as he thinks he shouldn't weigh any more.
Whoever gives priority to saving money and the quality of the accommodation is with him to the second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindler Hotelers are currently offering mostly weekly stays on Silvestra.
I think they'll try to marry them for a while, but then they'll let them go for a little while.
And then the rooms will die quickly," Jandura estimated.
The free bed in all winter periods is still offered by the Ingtours peak travel office.
Now we're most interested in a Christmas week that's not yet sold out.
That's how half of the seats in our offer remains free.
That's why we've already found some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in the Giant Mountains can offer the top travel office also, but there are fewer places available.
Good for the rest also for the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter periods are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the year on the mountains without snow.
If they are snowed during the week, Christmas is also sold out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, something better than the wreath can be contained in the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Peci pod Sněžko.
We're about five percent better on this.
We have the last few seats on Silvestra and Christmas.
A lot of interest is about Polish holidays in January and it's well sold in February," said Karel Rada, the director of the best mountain hotel.
Of the 80 percent have the Silvetrov stays occupied and the Omnia Hotel at the central parking lot in Janský Lázni.
On the contrary, half of the beds are available in the most recent Janskolasen hotel on Christmas.
We were delighted to be surprised this year by the ice that we already have about 60 percent.
It's a little weaker so far in February, but once snow strikes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will certainly rise, said the hotel director of Omnia Erik Sporysch.
However, on a larger snowy slope, the crockery hotelkeepers have to let the taste go.
On Thursday, if there's any rains, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then it is due to come again to warm up, Jiří Jakubský informed from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
It is even comical, with which the school effort Barack Obama, the president of the world's smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered to be the stupidest.
Finally, when he put out his coveted Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had described it through a copy from Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only does he use the verb "as in Iraq" in his own text several times, but he does not even dare to use the name Bush's January 2007 statement as the name of his own statement: "New Way Forward".
At the same time, he criticised Bush himself three years ago for sending fresh military troops to Iraq in a civil war-torn manner as "inresponsible and in its disastrous consequences".
The following months, however, have shown that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of the full commanders was the only possible and most successful one that today's reports on Iraq do not address at all.
Bush didn't improve his reputation, but he objectively left his successor a much more appreciative starting position than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was again asked by full commanders for the military contingent, in particular Chief of Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordinary habit, severely criticized heavy-duty shooters in the White House.
He asked 40 thousand men to break the situation for the better.
The president weighed three months, but he didn't get any better, so at least he ambushed the general with 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to make up for about 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally counted at least 10 from his own.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than provides answers.
Many doubt that half-incentives give the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the brutal wars of the past few years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is marked by a different symptom - no one can be relied on and no agreements can be complied with.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces are being badly prepared to change their Lord every day according to how they do so.
Political institutions, although formally founded, will remain only a legacy village, which will continue to have patriarchal tribal relations.
The balance between the interests of various ethnic groups is unusually complex given the opacity of the conditions which are even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the construction of an "assisted state", which is a minimalist objective of the entire operation, does not seem too realistic.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is affecting his volunteer.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent to a war cry for the purpose of "fast return home" causes here a miracle done, only a soul can truly be romantic, reality unaffected.
From a political point of view, the date of withdrawal of troops is a clear responsibility, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect recognition of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan tends to be less.
European politicians do not have and do not want to explain to their wills how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war at the foot of Hinduism.
Another factor that can radically affect the situation is developments around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran do not come into effect, the United States will face a serious issue, will it not try to solve the problem by military force?
The answer will have to be given at exactly the time when Obama says America will move towards a victory descent from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only trap for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain in the presidential elections, so there is still enough time left for him to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer get cash rewards
The top executives of the US Goldman Sachs will not receive cash salary this year.
It informed the company, which is thus responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 senior managers will get instead of the stock money that will be available for sale within five years.
In addition, the shares may be taken by managers in the event of excessive risk.
Goldman Sachs is thus led by the agency Reuters to try to connect wages to Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to be issued, the former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank has become a target of criticism after, in the first three quarters of this year, giving aside nearly $17 billion (approximately €300 billion) for remuneration.
The total remuneration in the company this year according to Reuters is likely to exceed $20 billion in spite of the notified measure today.
High salaries in the banking sector have become a hot political topic in a number of countries with the coming financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that a banker’s bonus of more than 25,000 pounds (about 712,000 CZK) would charge a one-off tax of 50 per cent.
A similar step is being taken by France.
This year women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
The record five women today in Stockholm were taken from the hand of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustafa this year's Nobel Prize in professional and literary categories.
Besides four scientists among them were also the German writer of Romanian origin Hert Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their country Jack Szostak, for research in chromosomes.
The price for chemistry was received by Israel's Ada Jonath, together with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to explain the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner was Nobel Prize for the economy won by American Elinor Ostrom and her country Oliver Williamson for economic management analysis.
The only professional category that went around this year without a holder was physics.
Today, scientists Charles As for optical fiber research and George Smith and Willard Boyl have taken this prize for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical remote views.
Each graduate took a diploma, a Nobel Prize and a certificate of financial reward.
In each category, it reaches ten million Swedish crowns (about 25 million Kč).
If they are distinguished in each and every one of them, the reward shall be shared.
Traditionally, the most unexpected Nobel Peace Prize has been won by American President Barack Obama this afternoon in Norway's Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, for he was only at the beginning of his journey and was also in the forefront of a country that waged two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
But in defending his policy, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to achieve peace, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering the demise.
President Václav Klaus will accept the Minister of Finance of Eduardo Janota on Friday morning, who is considering delaying the government, because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for the following year, as the Ambassador approved on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps Janot's suspension in the cabinet will be the subject of their Friday meetings.
The budget also criticises Klaus.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further deepens the public finances crisis.
The meeting was briefed by President Radim Ochvat's spokesman.
Janota wants to deal with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget law that Klaus is now getting to sign, the Czech Republic should run the 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, the House voted against the left-wing proposals for money transfers and raised the money on the salaries of state employees, on the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has called for proposals for social democracy by secretly raising the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right to the right of the other side, there was a sharp internal political dispute, which led to the beginning of a question about the further operation of Fischer's official office, on which the ODS, ČSSD and Green Party had formed in the spring of the agreement.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the package of economic measures imposed by Fischer's government in the fall and is intended to stop the debt of the state.
Klaus, who can, but also does not have to sign the state budget law, announced today's breakfast with the businessman that politics has for a long time been neglecting "a serious problem", which is "an unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He says he doesn't have a good solution today.
The improvement could only bring about a strong government that could, moreover, bring about a wider consensus of the political parties, my President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Neczas said that the concept of an official office with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "strong sentences".
ČSSD chief Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánka's words that the terrible budget deficit that the former Topolánkov government has prepared for this year and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD marked the approval of the state budget for the next year for success.
The people were also at peace.
Mandelu played Morgan Freeman in the newspaper of Clint Eastwood
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Unbeatable will tell the world a lot about the country, about its fights and victories despite some criticisms that the main roles are created by American actors.
The story will tell about sports, racial relationships and Nelson Mandel.
A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first Montenegrin President Nelson Mandel in his life story is an Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that twenty-one-two-year-old Mandela asked him if he could make it in Eastwood.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
For example, a two-and-a-half-year-old actor who won an award for the role in the Eastwood Drama from the Million Dollar Baby Box created for example a leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave, the fictitious president of the United States, and even God in God's Evan, but rarely anyone else who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released for freedom in 1990, and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for unbeatable and is a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The picture is a true story of Nelson Mandela joining forces with the captain of the South African rugby team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly-elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains after apartheid still racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can connect his people through sports, so he will decide to unite the football players that belong to the world-wide dimension between outsiders.
The South African team will eventually enter the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for a few years to get Mandel's story on canvas.
I had no other goal but to play this role so that I could get as close to her as possible, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found out that when I print your hand, I take your energy, it's transmitted, and I felt that I know how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to be with another person.
Matt Damon is featured in the film Françoise Pienaara, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role of rugby in the hard world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember how I rang the doorbell, he opened to me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look a lot bigger in the movie."
Despite the clear differences in the characters of the actors compared to their actual assumptions under the leadership of the director of Eastwood, Invictus received: Unbeatable positive review and is also talking about the ambitions of Oscar.
The movie critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his review in words: "It was a very good story, a very well done film."
In film reviews on the Rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76% of positive reviews.
September secret over Norway dissolved: Russians were testing the rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
Only yesterday, the Russian Defence Ministry admitted that near the Norwegian border, a intercontinental ballistic missile was being tested.
But the start was again unsuccessful and shot marked as "Bulava" type, which was originally to be the mud of the Russian army, slowly becoming the black plague of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests did not have an effect on the success of pilot flights.
Most of the boulevards didn't fly or get hurt in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulve" is already written as "a rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This in the 13th series has been a normal attempt at the beginning.
By the end of the flight, there was a technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently the engine exploded at the third level of the rocket.
This time, "Bulva" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donski, which sailed below the white sea.
This type of rocket enables the firing of a vessel which is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was actually damaged by "Bulava".
From the very first moment, Norwes had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals are defending themselves, and they claim that they cannot speak clearly about failure.
The first two stages of the rockets survived, and the accident hit to the third.
In the previous cases, engines were damaged immediately at the first level.
Even though no trial started without a mistake, only six out of thirteen of the Defence Departments have failed.
Nearly fifty percent success therefore fills the generals with optimism and still claims that "Bulava" will one time fly without problems and that it will even take up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total mass of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51-year annual contract in CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender of Vjačeslav Fetisov is presented again in a professional hockey game in 51 years.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and the holder of Stanley Cup will help with his team CSKA Moscow and will appear on Friday's KHL duel against Petrograd.
Fetisov, who completed his career in the 1940s in 1998, is currently President of the Cska.
After Denis Kuljaš gets hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We just need to resolve some formalities, quoted by the agency AP looking at the Moscow Club of Sergei Germany.
It's not clear yet whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only concern one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of the other players, he said.
Thus, according to the AP, in the case of return to ice, Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockey provider.
In the NHL, he played 15 goals and 26 assists in the whole season for Hartford's legendary attacker Gordie Howe.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union's training, he won two Olympic gold, seven world champions, triumphed over Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he was also successful in NHL, where he twice raised Stanley Cup in Detroit.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the hockey Son of glory.
Hyundai has spoken to the board.
The management of Hyundai's car with the board agreed to cancel all the overtime.
It was due to frequent overtime that the committees announced an emergency on Monday.
Confirmed the speaker's car Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, management wants to agree with the board on another Saturday shift.
We can't give up on our production plan, which is fundamental, so a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two changes being made, Vaněk said.
Server Sevenmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work on the Saturday shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
That people get back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vanika, the company decided to change the motivation of employees during the proposed overtime.
They either let themselves pay the extra overtime or they can choose the spare time on December 28th, and thereby, by the day, extend their Christmas holidays, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees will get paid drivers and lunches.
In view of the fact that the weather was the most urgent and urgent point of view in terms of the comments and complaints of the experts, and the protesting employees who stopped production last week, Vaněk said yesterday afternoon, with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime by December.
Car employees were forced to work out a two-hour shift almost every day last week.
Upon signature of the agreement, the staffing committee shall withdraw the emergency
Further negotiations between the car management and the experts are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
On Wednesday, the head of the board, Peter Cooker, said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are prepared to cancel the strike.
The situation in the car was resolved last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously paid for their overtime.
They also protested against bad pay conditions and alleged harassment.
The Board of Directors recommended that overtime employees should work to meet the requirements for the supply of cars.
In their Monday statement, the Board also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the board requires the company to reduce the overtime to a minimum.
Besides, they want to pay 5,000 crowns this year.
The Hyundai Car now employs 2,000 people.
The company's serial production broke up last November.
By September this year, it has produced about 80,000 cars, and its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also carries on 'depressed' HIV
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also takes on viruses that have already received against medicines for immunity.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the combination on the common variant of the virus is not as strong as some medicines already available.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the reproduction of HIV in the body.
However, their use results in a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of virus multiplication is due to the development of so-called resistant viruses against which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallic carbonates act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metalcarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus other than all medicines used today and may therefore overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
Metalcarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made of boron atoms, hydrogen and carbon are combined with metal atoms, in this case cobalt.
Traditional and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV injection, mature viral particles would not occur.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in the press report issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cells (see table) are combined with a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
Something weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease substances was tested in the laboratory and also against its (resistant) variants from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarbonates on the usual variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinical medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which medicines are often ineffective.
The only mechanism of the effect and its other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical adaptations from metalocarbons are interesting compounds for further research aimed at proposing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlín Rézačová, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
A budget crash, the ODS got into Fischer, the one who's fighting.
The head of the ODS Mirek Topolánek marked the approved budget for the following year as "fearful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The ODS' statement marked the government's president as a strong verdict.
He's leaving time for analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Netimes said that the concept of the official office with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
The President of the Government has to decide, according to the Times, whether he intends to join the House on a minority that is fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is lagging behind with parliamentary left.
The ODS approach and social democracy to the issue of public deficits are diametrically different, Netimes noted.
On Wednesday, the 2010 budget was adopted, however, with left-wing amendments of more than 12 billion crowns.
The survey raised money on salaries of state employees, on the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's emphasis on social democracy's proposals was that they secretly raise the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to have a share of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, expressed the government's desire that even the revised budget was a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and emptiness
Minister of Finance Eduard Janato talked about disappointment and sense of emptiness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government's current situation would be further evaluated.
Sometimes it is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to leave the function in the event of the adoption of the amendments, the situation might seem different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered to the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering further delay in function.
The reason is his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks for another fight with the budget deficit, they do not, according to the times in the government, what the ČSSD nominees do, which has planted changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will give a demise if the House approves other laws of an increasing deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or new service law.
Topolánek: Ministers for the appointment of the ODS did not proceed
It's the matter of Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ODS nominees did not do anything wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text report.
He recalled that in a number of ministries, there are people reporting to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Sometimes he stressed that if Fischer decides to resign to the principle of the fight against the deficit of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is a left-wing majority that is currently in the picture".
Then he cannot count on the support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's up to me, I'm going to dedicate myself to it, he told reporters in the photos of the defence minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the citizens of democracy.
Prime Minister Fischer went to the Brussels European Council this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS has stepped up
At the same time, he stressed that on Wednesday, ODS would probably vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister did not expressly ask for the adoption of the budget.
We do not seem to be orphans, we are not small children, then we have responded to the question of whether the ODS did not trouble the presence of the President of Parliament and the Czech Republic in the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that the next few months would be mainly about the Bolshevik shooting and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD order, less trains will be driving almost the same
The Czech routes from December 13 will cancel or limit some less burdensome speeds and locations, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of transport shall be reduced from the date of the entry into force of the new driving licence compared to today by two percent.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer drivers, will not change.
For example, more connections to the main city are obtained by the residents of Ostravska, the tracks on this track add one set of pendolin.
On the contrary, the accelerator will stop driving to Bratislava.
Less speed will also go on the Prague - Sand - České Budějovice track, mainly limited direct connections Prague - Letohrad.
From the regions, the roads plan the largest reduction in transport in the Královéhradeck region, a total of eight per cent, on the contrary, Prague and the surrounding area can enjoy growth.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and the operation of several fasts on the Prague - Sand - České Budějovice route are limited to a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today the Milovićí must cross in Lysé nad Labem.
It is the 15th link of the Esco suburban system, its opening is possible due to the completion of the electricity supply from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Remote connections to the main city will end at the Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more connections SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostravo and trains to Schumperka/Jeseník will go at two hour intervals.
From December 13th, passengers no longer travel to Bratislava.
This year's account for regional railways: 200 million more
It quickly orders and pays the Ministry of Transport, in total, to pay for the so-called demonstrable losses, gives me four billion crowns next year, as well as this year.
This year, regional trains are more expensive than 200 million.
Locals and fasts have tracks with a newly concluded ten-year contract, so far it has always been a contract for one year.
Roads commend the system, which is why they have probably not been able to increase the prices of the rough majority of drivers.
Changes will only take place in one-day network ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiškya will take place just a short while away, so far the road between any regional cities has been unified and made 160 crowns.
Filipino armed forces still hold over 50 people, Children released
Today, the armed forces in the south of the Philippines have taken 75 people, including a number of elementary school students and their teachers.
It was introduced by the AFP agency, which initially informed only about 65 abductions.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 armed men are using hostages as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, the armed men belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP police agency, rape was initially prosecuted for violence that required the management of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed was declared a state of the art.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections to the government office were 30 journalists.
The governor of this south-eastern province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan tribe, were arrested for suspected involvement in the massacre.
On the island of Mindanao are also active Muslim separatists.
But they resumed the peace talks with the Filipino government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film, Clint Eastwood Invictus (an official name in Czech, Invictus: Undefeated) comes to the American cinema, which captures part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.
The role of a world-renowned apartheid fighter was set up by Morgan Freeman, who chose Mandela himself for his creation years ago.
The later male role of the legendary South African champion in the glory of Francoise Pienaara was created by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the picture into the movies, they come out of criticisms and public awareness.
Nelson Mandela
Born on 18 July 1918 in the South African Union, Nelson Rolihahl Mandela.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, then in 1993 together with de Klerk Nobel Prize for Peace.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa between 1994 and 1999.
Great expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when, however, in the South African Republic, preparations are being made for the world football championship, but the media are alarming reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination on the part of the Montenegrin ruling majority.
According to the report agency AP, the announcements for a new film in JAR for the time being are all positive, despite numerous exceptions to the inclusion of the main roles of "empty" Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film according to his own words.
I've been dreaming about that role for years, and I've been getting ready for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela himself many times to, as it is called, draw his energy, talk after the film's celebrated premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandel's personality and message through the film.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it's about every human being, added.
On the national rugby team's training
Image based on the book presentation by British writer John Carlin with a freely translated name In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portraits the South African human rights representative during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to stifle two races throughout the film and after a long period of time the mutually defined population group and, like in 1995, Nelson Mandela, he is also taking part in the acting role of the South African national rugby dress on the world cup field that JAR won at the time.
For the entrance to the lawn in the dress, which is understood in the JAR almost as something sacred, Mandela raised a large sheep mostly of the white public fourteen years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, according to the rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" in the national team.
If the tension in the JAR gets better, it'll just show up.
However, the white South Africans are sceptical, for example, in a recent LN interview, a fan of the rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled to Britain.
The championship will begin on 11 June 2010.
A transformer burns in Lounska for tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught the morning transformer of Čeps in the divorce place near the town of Výškov na Lounska.
The fire has six units in contact with Lukás Marvan, according to oral speakers.
The firemen initially wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they reassessed the opinion and the fire casts a mixture of water, foam and special resins.
The reason was the technical error, the internal failure of the transformer.
No one was injured, an accident according to the spokesman of Pauly Mandat's company does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, exactly counting it will succeed until the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will have to replace the Mandate with a new one.
In ten years' time, nothing like this has happened to Čeps, the issues of this type are isolated, complemented.
Electric power supplies were not affected by the operation of households, offices or fire companies of the tram shop, according to ČEZ spokesperson for the northern Czech Republic Soni Holinger Hendrich.
A.s. Čeps operates in the territory of Czech Republic as an exceptional transmission system operator, electrical controls 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 divorces with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system and driving routes with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura gives a criminal notice for a three-heitman talk from the ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura today gives a criminal notice for the talk on three social-democratic heitmanes.
And it's Michael Hask of the South Moravian region, Radko Martínka of the Pardubian region and the Hetman of the Olomouc region of Martin Tessarík.
Janchura put it in the radio station's twenty minutes.
The complaint concerns companies trying to operate regional train transport in some parts.
All regions, however, have finally signed long-term agreements with the Czech Dragons.
All three Heitmans are attacking us and talking about picking roses, but we've only brought the offer to what they wanted.
They say we're more expensive than Czech roads, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech roads that were closed last week.
So there's nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It's for a talk to the Student Agency, he said to the Janchure Radio Journal.
He also stated that he had evidence from all countries that he had not taken his steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing to encourage the European Commission.
The criminal notice has been filed by Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves him as the unpaid advertising of his company and his own people.
I am of course prepared to protect the good name of my country and my country and to the same challenge as the other Heitmans.
I assume that even on this occasion, it will be clear that it is Mr Janchura who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in regional rail transport, Hasek said.
Jančura has already announced last week that he is investing several million crowns in advertising, which will alert the countries of the unfavourable step.
He told the newspaper that the campaign after Christmas would be interrupted and that he wanted to continue in it after the New Year.
He made it clear that the campaign would be against corruption as such.
The campaign started with Janchura after the countries agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Dragons and to order around 150 billion crowns did not write down tenders.
According to Jancura, the proceedings are similar and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train transport in the regions, Janchure has already threatened the ČSSD MP.
The only threat was that if we didn't let it go, we could get a bus license.
He's introduced himself as a ČSSD MP, I know which gentleman you're talking about, I'm not gonna say his name, he said to Janchure Radio Journal today.
Expectation against tyres will be free and non-compulsory
Anti-pneumococcal exposure from January will be a common practice.
It should be the first for families free and at the same time uncompulsory.
But voices are already being heard that it would be more effective to expect.
Preparations for the introduction of a free landing against tyres shall be completed.
The medical institution is already setting maximum prices for vaccines that will pay health insurance.
Experts are also clear in the process of expecting.
New Expectation
Free vaccines for children in August
From January, children born last August and later can be culled free of charge against tires.
The condition is that they haven't got a single dose of expectation yet.
Anyone who's started snooping last year or before has to pay for his own overtime.
The first dose should be given between 3 and 5 months of age of the child.
Last year, she volunteered to let her children fight the tires of a quarter of her family.
Parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are required when expecting younger children.
In general, experts estimate that health insurances spend between 300 and 450 thousand crowns a year at the cost of cleaning.
But they'll save for the treatment that the children would need without waiting.
So far, he has given about 500 thousand children every year for all the ample expectations.
The so-called Janot's package introduced the welcome.
Pneumococcal causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including inflammation of the brain and blood vessels.
For a year, we're going to die of pneumonia infection in hospitals with up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the children's plyings against tyres were introduced in 40 countries.
Will the expectation be binding?
At the same time, there are views that this expectation might be binding in the future.
Since January, it's supposed to be insured and not mandatory.
For example, Nałas Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civil association, pointed to a better expectation.
His association promotes a long-term pneumococcal vaccine.
The experts at the international conference that our association attended were not fully satisfied with our voluntary expectations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has been achieved.
I think it's the road that we have to go on now, according to Kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the anti-pneumococcal expectations.
At this point, we don't even consider it, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršenj.
Voluntary Expectation Has its Advantages, Hard Doctors
Hana Cabrnoch, president of the Professional Association of Practical Child Doctors, acknowledges that he has a voluntary expectation of his disadvantages.
If all the children were taken into custody, it might be thought of reducing the number of overcrowding "For a situation where this vaccine is so high, we understand relatively the political decision that the vaccination has been initiated as voluntary," Cabrnoch says.
Experts expect his grades to be rubbed against tires from next year by more than 80 percent of fresh parents.
Pneumococcal expectations are also broken by the fact that, as the children’s first flat expectations, health insurance does not stop.
Insurance should spend money on prevention, saving for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy their own drugs.
However, it is related to the concerns of the practical child doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines should be purchased from insurance companies, and doctors should receive them just as the state provides them with drugs for other treatments.
Some Members, however, feared that insurance could be "delegated from health insurance".
That's why doctors will have to buy the drugs and wait for them to be paid by the insurance company.
It is estimated that individual practitioners will invest 40,000 months in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnoch.
Son of an American artist 's stolen in the museum'
The son of a renowned American maker, Frank Frazetta, was accused of trying to steal images worth 20 million dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The police in Pennsylvania said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr Frasetta and the other man were used to enter a museum in the Poconco Mountains Bagr region.
Mr Frasetta Senior, 81, celebrated the creation of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as the press agency Associated Press reported.
The AP quoted the former police officer as saying that Mr Frazetta was younger than he could have been motivated to act by long-standing family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr. Frasett issued a younger swearing statement, aged 52 years, that he did so at his father's direction, "to get into the museum in any way possible and move the images into the sweeter areas," said the agency.
Mr. Frasetta Senior denied any such authorization as the agency had stated.
Labourers against planned tax increases
Ministers defended the increase in taxes and cuts in expenditure reported in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and committees.
As Alistair Darling pointed out, the Torys have "promulgated" the possibility of showing that they mean seriously delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the elections.
Even the chancellor got under fire because of the low- and middle-income deficit.
According to its proposal, there is mainly a growth of 0,5 % in social security and 1 % in the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Resolution on social insurance
The committees protested that low-income workers were punished for the recession they did not blame and warned against "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - growth is about 3 billion pounds a year - which has boosted the community of entrepreneurs who said it was employment tax, while it should focus on economic recovery.
This increase, which limits these revenues to more than 20,000 pounds per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PBR key points
Social insurance will increase by another 0,5 % from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected by 4,75 % this year
New tax 50 % of bankers' bonuses
Growth 1% tax on companies for write-offs in small companies
Reduction of taxes on electric cars and wind power stations
Increase in the measurement of pensions by 2,5 %
According to the estimate, some revenues of 30000 pounds a year are reduced by 90 pounds and some revenues of 40000 pounds are reduced by 190 pounds, while some revenues of 10000 pounds are increased by 110 pounds.
Ministers announced that their goal of reducing the deficit by half by 2013 was "complicated decision-making", but argued that 60% of the special taxes should be 5% of those with the highest income.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms has argued that the proposed increase in taxation and expenditure limitation would be "the drop in the ocean" compared with what would be necessary to do.
"It allows us to reduce the deficit by half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should come at the end of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth - which will have an impact on the volume of necessary loans and on how the deficit will be reduced quickly - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to review previous amounts.
In his opinion, the economic downturn was 4.75% this year - far worse than the fall of 3.5% predicted in April - because the loans were 3 billion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Promulgated opportunity'
Conservatives, who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the "debt crisis" of laborers, marked the planned loan of 789 billion pounds over the next six years as ineffective.
Ministers failed to put forward a credible plan to replace it, added, "cynically" they postponed this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourers insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future jokes unlike Tory's proposals that would want to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal democrats argue that money generated by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to support expenditure in the coming year rather than to reduce the deficit, and argue that plans are "based on sand".
The BBC political commentator Nick Robinson stated that the timing of the announcement - for example, the above inflation is increasing and will result in the inability to pay the doses in the next April - that it could lead to the Chancellor's charge in the election campaign if the money was difficult to get back a year later.
But laborers continue to provide special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
Suspected budget'
Although the ministers did not publish the details of the expenditure after 2011, the economists stated that it is clear that the reduction in public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The recognised Institute of Budget Studies has announced that the office numbers indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially include transport, higher education and defence in the future.
"It's really painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the elections if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte's bookstore.
"It was a report on the suspect preliminary budget, and markets are making it happen."
FBI conducts investigations in 'American Prisoners in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation in the Pakistan prison of five Americans suspected of connection to extremists.
Men were arrested for an attack on a house in Sargoda in the province of East Panjab, as told by the BBC of the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was an investigation into whether it was the same man who had been declared unconscious in the last month in their residence in the American state of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are said to originate from Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the other comes from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were held," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit reported that the agencies were informed about the arrest and were in contact with families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to identify their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncles of one of them.
It has been stated that the house has always been a centre of interest to the local police and that charges against arrested men have not yet been brought.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, the press agency Reuters reported, but stated that the United States must "cooperate very closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Absent amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The situation of respect for human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, says Amnesty International's report.
The report describes in detail "the methods of torture" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected the above-mentioned criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran and tens of them were killed following the controversial election of President Mahmud Ahmadinepurchase, leading to the biggest street demonstration since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Tens of them were sentenced to imprisonment, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five persons to death.
BBC writer John Leyne, who is now in London, stated that earlier in protest High Leader Ayjatoláh Alí Chomejní declared the wrongfulness of certain torture methods and prohibited their implementation in the Karizak Correctional System.
But since then, almost no legal criticism of power has been tolerated, according to our correspondent.
False confession'
Amnesty International quoted the report of a 26-year-old student in the field of computer technology, Ibrahim Methari, who stated that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protests against the results of the elections.
"Frequently they were in my face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head, they threatened me with a cure, and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed false confessions and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, said Amnesty.
In August, Mehdi Charroubí's presidential candidate was defeated after the protests was detained after the elections and sentenced to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian senior state officials denied charges of rape, but admitted torture.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner who claimed to have been held in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and justice had set up committees to investigate the concerns and reactions of the government, but stated that the mandate and authority of the authorities were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees had been published.
The group stated that at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski lift was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the memory in Bristol into a race track.
The driver's track for the race in the park has attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the trainway in the Brandon Hill Park was a short jump bridge ahead of a 100 m long train.
A fourth year medical student John Hickman said that it was a beautiful view from the top of the highway, but that it was really appealing.
It was a beautiful view of the bright lights of the city down.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
Prices were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the highway.
After the Thursday evening competition, the snow was left to rot.
Still them and us
Can I be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters called after the ban on the construction of mines, and in general the alarming reports of alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrated - into one of the most unreliable secular societies of the continent.
After reading this book, some readers became admirers of the author of the last work, "Why the French don't like the hats on their heads" (2006), this elegant and debated study on controversial issues that have been dividing and employing the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened on the basis.
He spent months in the mixes, schools and institutes that are now taking care of 5 to 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students on issues that are most concerned about them.
Should I enter a marriage union in a mosque or in a councilroom (or both)?
Should the young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can a Muslim marry a man who's not a Muslim?
Does Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These seem to be the world's controversial issues that are being debated and which are part of everyday life more than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of assets, teachers and intellectuals, among others commonly known persons, except Tarika Ramadan, Arab, a Muslim researcher and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how it can be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives do not believe in the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen interviewed are joining the domain that it is the anti-polo of Salafi—priests of the Purists Sunni Islam, who are associated in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
They ask themselves how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who so strongly defends the local public) are really devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It is of the opinion that Muslims have probably less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make a historic compromise with secular republic.
More than the development of pragmatism has found "the hiding of the screws of values".
After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say, "Yes, but not now."
The World’s Most Exciting View
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
The limiting ice is the alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The loans of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water sources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
In the book "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, author and illustrator, resembles the natural history of the North icon, a polar bear.
Well-informed of the complicated history and the masonry processes describe the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to power the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a brave fourteen-year-old swimmer who was fighting only with the shell of the fly is really a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears who were swimming behind their newly killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared suddenly in one circus state.
Even today gardens in the zoo typically have an area a million times smaller than the area they have grown up in the wild. Climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.
You'll find more after clicking here!
Mr. Ellis draws from the work of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters are threatening the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indians are hunted on skis and all are armed with effective assault gloves that shoot their advantage.
Ironically, it is being played in the waters north of these two hunting nations and that ice will finally be the largest.
In his new book "After Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unsatisfied responsibility for the Arctic science and a ludicrous summer view of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the rate of change.
It's for lack of testing.
Fridtjof Nansen's research journeys at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries indicated for the first time the movement of floating ice.
The cold-war ponies then mapped out the hummingbirds when they were underflooded.
Satellite research and extensive probes in floating ice-creams are a useful supplement, but many are still being carried out thanks to vulnerable individuals, campers in winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking into the extremely fragile world of the backward system inside the Arctic ice created by the drying of salt water that melts when frozen.
But from the height of the bear to the microscopic marvels, all of this is doomed to destruction as the summer ice moves, which is sometimes played between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it can be us'
6000 members of the seabed put the sailors on their graves in Arlington
Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple van on a soldier's grave with whom he had never met.
For him and the other marine footmen who made their way from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville in North Carolina to the National Graveyard in Arlington to decorate the graves, it was the day when he took away the hold of men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months' time when we're in, it can be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me to show me respect just as I try.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to put prisoners at the funeral of veterans in several departments in the Arlington Führer Act.
In 1992 Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, started this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Flying Act.
Now it is an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the army and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters don't look for profit in it, they run across America, which they own in other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 veneers in the Arlington cemetery, in the Pentagon area, in the National cemetery Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City, and in the memorial flight number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The second year, Walmart has spent more than $150,000 on the purchase and transport of wine.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, stated that she had made her way to Arlington to honor her husband, the deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband wasn't buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way back to what she was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Greened in layers of warm matter, volunteers walked through the cemetery to the surrounding lawns and pahoras.
Volunteers turned to older graves from the First and Second World Wars and from the Vietnam Wars, because these are not visited as often as the newer graves.
The joy was positive when the children played and held their hands together when they carried a young pine tree to our tombstones.
Each round bean was dark green with a small red bee cover on top.
Near § in section 60, where most veterans from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there was really silence.
The United Service Organizations devoted 1,000 vincas to decorating the department, but the cloudy mood of the wars just underway filled this area.
Some sincerely cried, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved into stones, while others agreed to see small black and white names pressed into a wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
She spent eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohio to visit the last resting place of the sergeant of David Shane Spicer's regiment, who fell into a battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, rules.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
US Government Supplier Imprisoned by Cuban Government Officials
The Cuban government has detained an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as officials of the foreign ministry introduced on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. with a residence in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular officers, together with the American interest section in Havana, sought access to the detainee who was detained on 5 December.
Certain charges have not been made public, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, are at risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by the popular commenter Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to take over the prices, but her permission has been denied.
The detention of an American supplier may be the result of an increasing tension between the Communist Brother Castro, ruling in Cuba, and Obama's administration, which was seen as a "holding tactic" in improving relations with the island.
As the first to report on the arrest of New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although these are new and sought-after Commodities in a country where the average salary of a state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are used mostly by sending text messages, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's salary.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and in some government attachments, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign in must give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in the prison in Cuba are behind the snares of drug abuse, according to Gloria Berben, the printing officer of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
Incarceration and detention were clearly moral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American human rights enforcement programme, who recently published an unfavourable report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the tattoo of Cuba," as an attack on Raula Castro's installation as a leader of the country and a replacement for the famous older brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the charges were often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all the solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are focusing on a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are exposed to conspiracy regarding the sending of men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities revealed an alleged conspiracy leader concerning the sending of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, and they stated that they hoped that this case could help expose a wide network of terrorists who are tracking the Internet and searching for a radicalized young man.
The investigators reported that they were searching for three rebel personalities, known as Saifilláh, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men published a comment approving the terrorist attacks on YouTube's website.
Saifilláh sought the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan in the zone of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But the Pakistani reporter who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifilláh was unsuccessful in certifying Al-Qaeda commanders and that men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were exiled for several days to the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the horrific mountains in the northwest, which became the refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a hit unit.
The reason they were expelled was stated by an official who spoke of maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official stated that the men were not frightened and were still trying to obtain consent to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the exercise of Pakistani law.
The case of this five - who remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruits in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, the identification of who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has placed the highest priority on attempting to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The sponsors of the organization act as guards, excluding those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who could be investigators.
U.S. fake recruits have been detailed in al-Qaeda's special investigation, analytics have been introduced.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential access to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation with a seat in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years in enabling him to join them because the US news agencies have found experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their set-up model, which has already been monitored so much? Mr. Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Kodana, demanding climate action
Tens of the protesters marched down the streets this Saturday and demanded more important climate action than the negotiators at the Bella City Congress Centre.
Protesters reported the number of participants in this event, but the police hope that the number was about 25000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists placed a few small loads near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day when a small incident occurred in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists passed through the city and carried transparency with the English inscriptions "This is not a planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, who reported "The country says 'quit'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish models and photographers Helena Christensen, who indicated that she had traveled to her mother's home in Peru and provided me with information about the restless state of the country where climate change is taking place.
That's part of why we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leading personality to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it has to be done, it can't be avoided.
The police prevented the protestant from approaching the center of Bella and stated that she had held 19 people, in the first place because they either had masks or had pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating spectators, who does not want to be identified because they are involved in climate talks, masked activists as athletes and in black clothing have put several loads near the Kodani main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They were agitated at the buildings, they said, they started with lights, but then there were "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television shows to watch the tour during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the minds of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration nevertheless had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Currently, that is something that I was not aware of" (in fact it is something I do not know).
Then he went on in Chinese and said, "Because the place is huge, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the views of everyone.
The focus is on the broad public and the various sectors and the subject matter of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
Test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certification of the knowledge gained from mathematics was welcomed as a feature of the good news about public education in the Columbia County.
Although the district is far behind the country's highly efficient systems, the certificate has shown greater progress among the students of the fourth and eighth classes in the last two years than in the cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Centre for the Advancement of Learning is the enduring differences in the knowledge acquired between African-white students and both local and national.
The average result of the fourth-class white disciples of the Columbia District for the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from 500 possible), but their Afro-American rowers have only reached only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has actually increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among African Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant deviation of one point from 245 to 245.
The average result for white disciples was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade disciples in 2003 when the first NAEP was carried out in the district was 60 degrees (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference in the complaint was about 58.
In the past week, some district education defenders said that the results celebrated by the secretaries Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were more widely stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the margin of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality of employment in the district.
I didn't jump up and down for two or three points, said a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown Committee (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticising the style of administration of Mrs. Rhee, Mrs. Brown said that reporting on the results of the tests meant secondary education in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the bets and I respect it.
But what's frightening is that we haven't spent almost no time and energy that we needed to spend on our high school.
Mrs. Rhee said that the effort of the district is to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are reading in the use of new basics, Wilson's reading system, aimed at students in higher secondary schools and high school students who have not been able to manage the basics of reading before in their knee careers are significantly behind their peers.
Every day mathematics and the basics of mathematics education into sixth grade, emphasising the games and the experience of real life that came into the district as former director of Clifford Janey, can be added to the call for the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and make the best efforts of those students who remain under the level of the class, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others stated that the results of the NAEP explained the question whether Ms. Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and funds for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's a certain winner of Mrs. Michelle Rhee's dilemma, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The Convention’s reform process is to focus funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the province of Colombia.
Thus, the focus can lead to political rumours that are directed against an important agenda.
However, the results are also among the other city directors who are trying to maintain the average between the white and the black.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We need to use the proximity of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can rely on their children to be provided with excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to ensure that the school's validity is fulfilled.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his teacher association last year for a school year in 185 days, which is a "sign" for seeking a greater increase next year.
Make higher education part of the better future
The train bus drove to Gettysburg College with a loud breath.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came out and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns..
Gracielin's parents were having a hard time graduating from high school in El Salvador.
So far Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the college floor.
Now she and the other eight-class students in the group were studying Gettysburg, where the school cost $38690 a year, their position was more than the fear of visitors being excited about potential students.
Yes, that's it! she called Graciela who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them access to the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? She made it up to me when they were exposed to a low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania train was one of seven who visited their class session and were now completely interested in the next report: The question is not whether you will join the college.
The question is where?
However, this is a serious problem regarding the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from high schools or who are pregnant as minors, but there are statistics of those who are receiving further education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, five of this "long-generation" Spanish students from college - remarkablely achieved results indicate that many of their immigrant parents, most of the Mexicans and residents of Central America, arrived in the United States without finishing high school.
Their story of success is important, researchers say, because it undermines their point of way forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the labour force fields of the countries.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they had a natural tendency to attend school and had a natural tendency to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programmes also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to graduate again - especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we take into account that children come from low income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to guide them in the system, no matter what simple action they take at each point, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from Latin America.
We need to think about providing these children with an attractive network of preschool age in every way possible for them to study high school.
The federal program that funded Graciely's train trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (appropriate), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch further preparatory programmes that start for students from low-income groups in secondary schools and continue until these students graduate from high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, of which more than % have joined the colleges, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry has reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Notwithstanding concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to introduce significant oil companies to rebuild its non-compulsory infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play a significant role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, protected by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies went with capital participation to just two out of 10 exported fields.
Seven American companies paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on a field that was shaken in June.
The limited participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war, and instead of American companies you have first on the road to Asia and Europe, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It'll be long before there's anything else in Iraq for sale.
The security concerns, highlighted by the massive coordinated bombings in Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US army are likely to reflect American companies from a much more intensive company in Iraq, which has proven to have the third largest raw material reserve, say analysts.
In some cases, US companies have been disadvantaged, in particular Chinese and other governments controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the ministry.
The front American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were senior shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in bids on more contracts than all other companies and went with large stakes in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economic, as well as technological, spokesperson for the Assam Jihad oil industry.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and will meet its obligations to Iraq.
The companies that were initially selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared with the ministry at the price of the barrel, and the ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
In the event of an US missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, the top planner of al-Qaeda operations was apparently killed, as officials of the US Counter-Terrorism Department announced on Friday.
As confirmed, it could be a second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car Thursday near Miran Sáh in the province of North Vasiristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have alleged that the missiles were fired from a plane without a type of crew operating with the CIA in the field of illegal native tribes.
These were listed on the white car, which was directed towards the Afghan border when it was hit, an official, along with a Pakistani cyclist intelligence agency, called from Miran Shah.
The officer stated that the local armed forces had joined the point and quickly had fun, which was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. officials of the anti-terrorist department were quoting an unspecified witness who stated that Somalia was a death sentence.
Somalia was designated as a highly established planner for al-Qaeda military operations, which operated terrorist groups outside the areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the establishment of the world, said a senior officer who did not want to be appointed, who pointed out the sensitive nature of American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he stood at the centre of this position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was given instructions from Al-Qaeda's highest leadership and was planning possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said that Somalia acted quickly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a widely known person for some Americans, but that he didn't humiliate himself in any way to invite before us and our allies, another officer said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban who should have been killed since September when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of the militant group in the band of native tribes, and three other top executive leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks initiated by the CIA using unmanned aircraft has been reduced from the summer from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to the records of the Long War newspaper, websites, managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may be due to the improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also impetuously killing people suspected of being informants, mentioned on the page.
The United Nations High Representative has resigned in Kabul.
The United Nations High Representative to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, announced on Friday that he would like to resign from his post in March and would end such a stormy period of operation as was dreamed of by allegations of widespread corruption in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure is due to Obama's administration's decision to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate stated that it had supported growth, but expressed concern that the US timetable for reducing the state that starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The undertaking accepted must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
Growth on the side of armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he didn't give up, but that he was just fulfilling his promise to his family in March 2008, that he only spent two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has now indicated that he would need time to find a refund.
Like I said, it's high time to look after the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to U.S. officials, Ban started looking for a replacement.
The officials stated that they were deciding between Staffan di Misturo, who had Swedish-Italian origin and had previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, France, who had previously conducted the UN peacekeeping operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September of President Hamid Karzaim who won the country's presidential election from masking the presence of massive electoral machines.
Eide denied this claim, but stated that Galgraith's indictment -- which was released -- "surely damaged the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism in the light of international intervention" in the election.
Eide stated that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of citizens in order to coordinate the decommissioning of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successors to hire more U.S. and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money was properly used.
Eide expressed disappointment at the restriction of his efforts in Afghanistan and noted that the difficult United Nations recruitment regulations undermine its ability to use its capacity.
The United Nations rules are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers are soon to launch "further significant sanctions" on Iran due to the lack of involvement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a weekly trip to the areas where they are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, embalmed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question on probable development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [this] is unimaginable predictability in war.
Obama's administration decides on a package of sanctions that could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "balley of incentives and bans" would require "to receive the Iranian government to actually feel less secure with nuclear weapons", because "its inhabitants will suffer extraordinaryly" sanctions.
According to a Friday opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved the European leader in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not lead its nuclear programme to full compliance with the UN Committee on Nuclear Safety and its supervisory authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peace purposes.
In his discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to the talks on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of his uranium-enriched resources with an urgent exchange of fuel for the reactor for medical research.
The Administrative Board was set up as such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to make time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran has deviated from the provisional agreements - partly because of this, the expert states, because the Iraqi leadership is divided into opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, with regard to Iran's toughness with the international community in the case of some of the proposals he actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I think it has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together on a road that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including monitoring, which the Foreign Minister calls Hillary Rodham Clinton once "degrading sanctions".
In its opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned Thursday what it called "unresolved and unsubstantiated accusations" before some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue in talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before he left for Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
It remains a high tension between Kurda and the Iraqi Arab majority, especially due to borders, ownership rights and income sharing.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to prevent the retention of US plans to limit the number of US soldiers from 115000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to alleviate Kurdish anxiety from the ongoing depression. The official seats of the United States quoted Gates as telling Massoudu Barzaani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the United Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In the elderly China, change in course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, which read that "The Mother of the Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One child also means one more grave".
Then they learned that when the official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth and ageing in their city, suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We've always spent all our time and energy on just one child.
We left nothing for the second, says Wang, 31 years old, human resources manager, who has an 8-month son.
China's lasting policy of having only one child has been introduced for more than 30 years, creating two generations only notoriously chubbled and sweaty children, affected by the nicknamed "small emperors", the country is threatening the population crisis.
The average pregnancy decreased by 1.8 children to a couple compared to six before the policy came into force, according to UN data.
The population distribution, where the population is 60 years of age and above, is predicted to grow sharply from 16.7% in 2020 to 31.1% in 2050.
Inequality is greater in rich coastal cities with higher education populations, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, 60 - year - olds and older made up almost 22 percent of the registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning, said that many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the employment situation in the future".
He says it's about being "old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Step-by-step reconciliation
As it was incorporated into the country's constitution in 1978, one child's Chinese policy is probably the most controversial mandate of the Communist Party.
The two who have violated politics have faced unrelenting torture -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official sites advocated a policy that helped the country prevent critical use of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned in promoting politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to cope with the loss of their second child.
Moreover, many couples had to suffer sexist election losses, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been progressively more milder in their opinion on the policies of one child.
In 2004, they generally accepted the teaching of exceptions - including the residents of cities, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were singles - and in 2007 they remedied the dictatorships of their strong lines.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor of population research at Beijing University, said that central government officials had already discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner was a single.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to put down an aggressive campaign to encourage multiple births.
Almost overnight posters, urging parents to have only one child, were replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how it would be lawful to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent officers to plan families and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and put the airplanes under the door.
They also promised to provide sentimental and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, the family planning officials said.
Extensive response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai have noted an increase in interest among the two who would like to have a second child after the campaign, most urban districts have not reported any changes.
Huinan City District with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointment officials in Shanghai stated that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the Shanghai district of Caol, stated that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don't want more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said she would like two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese people who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a docked catch network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West judge the politics of one child as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in a relationship with the first child.
Yes, we've been given a chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
It's about money.
Other couples point to psychological reasons for weighing.
Wang, the manager of human resources, says they only want one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of the attention of our families and everyone cared for us.
We were not used to providing care, and we actually didn't want to take care of each other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who owns a translation company, said that much less.
For middle-aged two - career parents who reduced their delivery, he said to be successful means to be selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 years of growing up look at parents as going through the first days of the Czech experiment with capitalism and do not want to live this way for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on parental time, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions of space -- "You have to stop your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a summary prepared at the time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We're the first generation with higher standards of living, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN group has adopted a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by a far-reaching lack of attitudes and mutual recognition -- again on Friday focused on the release of a document proposing an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations, with the most of the burdens in the near future.
The text that can provide the horizon for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation highlights the remaining obstacles as it highlights the way forward.
But there was significant progress in the negotiations that took place in the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Kodana next week.
Established by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unmistakably indicates how much money rich countries should provide to those poor people to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides the whole range of elections for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that political actors will still be able to tolerate.
This gives the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequitt, senior representative of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, a 180-page breakdown of the text from the discussion to focus on what the top climate officer at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "a big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 per cent per year compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
On Friday, the European Union quickly agreed to provide $3.6 billion over the next three years to help the poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from flood management and drought to drought prevention.
Still Friday, however, he mentioned the same type of verbal fireworks that prevailed during last week’s talks.
The US Special Envoy for Climate Issues Todd Stern has rejected a speech requiring binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries in comparison with the voluntary nature of the major developing economies, if not financed by the developed world.
The move signaled that Obama's administration was on a tougher line towards China than the Bush administration's officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the Treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, Stern said, who also held that the text was not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei informed the US chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "rural understanding" or "extraordinary responsibility" led to a week earlier to the announcement that the United States would not help China to cope with global warming.
With the future of the economic pathways of the major world powers in bets, the tachonics broke both inside the developing world and between the industrial world and developing economies.
The current struggle is mainly about the preservation of individual economies rather than of the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States as regards the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while the poorest nations point out that two tenths of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative for greater action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting on who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to ban large issuers in their actions.
It is a clear game that the new economic hegemony is developing, Ulate said, who also serves as a regional advisor to regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change indicated that they would like to continue to pursue a legally binding agreement in Kodani, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the negotiations would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that prosecuting by small island nations "caused a political pressure on the entire polar process" partly because they are now united and require action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The debate called for a new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government were involved in the agreement.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Minister for Environmental Protection Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of State, stepped out of the aircraft and ran downtown Bell's halls to the closed doors of the meeting and new conferences so they could come up with the demands that will be assessed next week.
The exact scope of the meeting - when 13000 people moved from and to the congressional center each day, the guitar players staged an ironic night watching over the countries they thought they were sending, and there was more to hand-to-hand motions on paper than electronic mail -- a controlled challenge.
The intensity is just a construction: in Kodani, almost all key ministers and earlier in the middle of 60 heads of state were present.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister of Global Policy for International Nature Protection.
Heavy weights are coming.
British first train with speed 140 miles per hour pre-defined this Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the vizid cut the darkness to the sign of the departure of the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and a flight from Ashford in Kent to St Pancras London and will reach a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal assembly outside of London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with the international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great agglomerations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland with London.
Skipped standing waters should reduce transport times in passenger transport and on commercial routes and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
In theory, three main political parties were allowed to gain this vision.
But tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects and concerns about environmental degradation have now contributed to the construction of British high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, transmitted its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times reported.
She provided him with a detailed map of the route to another planned high-speed network.
The new London linkage to the West Midlands was designed to be within five metres in urban areas and districts where access to the livelihood could be problematic.
In the open area, the final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also expects to determine three options for the wide high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred choice is the configuration of the form of letter Y, when one high-speed track should lead to Western Midlands.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one line passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most efficient choice has come," said the railway expert.
Once it's done, the driving time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first phase, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow travellers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared with more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should allow trains to drive 2250 miles an hour, making it the fastest in Europe from the British network.
The initial track is already being proposed to take the 400 m long trains that would be able to transport 1,100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham track.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
Given the capital constraints, the existing station is expected to expand to include a high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to carry out this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general elections.
Even if it moves the wheel, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service, not on high-speed runways, but already existing runways north of Birmingham and keep the driving times between London and Scotland for over three hours.
This is regarded as the determining point for ensuring the transition from aircraft to train, the reference point for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers rented a mortgage of 75,000 pounds in Tory's Orange
Alan Duncan, the head of Tory's front chair at the parliamentary house, paid thousands of pounds last year for the oranges he built in his home in the electoral district.
speaking parties for the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs were living "from grants", increased his mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build a dub covered extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to take a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month for taxpayers.
The general authorities approved the claims in time and were thus not questioned by Sir Thomasen Leggem, who carried out the control of the members' expenditure. Last night Mr Duncan said his demands "could be cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two-storey houses in all of his round of elections, Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth about a million pounds.
There's a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the financial office has agreed to Mr. Duncan's need for more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is marked in the plans as "orange."
Neighbors describe her as "a glass of entertainment and entertainment".
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last check by the General Standards Committee and the privilege of the last settlement of the mortgage.
The committee informed him last month that he had violated the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed public security at the mortgage amounting to 271406 pounds of his property in London at the house in his constituency, which he purchased in 1991, a year before he became a member of the parliament.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan charged some 1,400 pounds a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds a month.
The interest of Mr Duncan's RBS mortgages could not have changed at this time, indicating that all of this was intended to finance a loan of 75000 pounds.
In December 2007, the default variable RBS decreased from 7.94 per cent in March 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year.
The final document of the general authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to charge 1250 pounds a month in May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as a shadow leader of the House in September after one secret reporter filmed it and said that Members must survive "on behalf of" after the spending scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live for an assignment and treat you like fuck."
He said: "I have lost money in exchange for my garden and for a small fraction of what I need.
And I could charge the whole damn part, but I won't do it."
The messenger, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first called upon to explain his edition in May, when it proved that he had charged thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the financial office that it "can be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pit in the form of a book mark in Mr. Duncan's lawn to protest after it was discovered that he had been charging 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked about an increase in the mortgage last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of an increase in capital, which was approved by both the financial authority and subsequently by the Legge."
He added: "It is not a controversial question of hiding and clicking or breaking rules or anything else.
It's absolutely straight down, according to the rules, legitimate, and that's all.
This could not be much more clean or simpler in other ways."
Come all to visit the Chat on the Brighton coast with an adventurous calendar.
Coastal chat rooms in Brighton found new meaning in the winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that stimulates the use of the duchy creatively has called 24 owners to make up their chat rooms for every day in December, and to use Christmas wheels as the theme of this exhibition.
The event began on December 1st, when visitors were allowed to visit the last chat room from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop bread and fried wine, provided free of charge.
Selected Christmas included I Saw Three Ships, About Come, About Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the chat presented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a television marketing assistant from Howe, is a non-student priest in a chichester diocese and leader Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important to people in post-Christian society.
"Why do we as a church expect people to come to a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an exciting way.
"The idea of an adventurous calendar in chats arose as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and pulsating place and we have tried to try and present it on a spiritual path."
Strong mobilization in Kodani and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding an important and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, demonstrated around the world in Kodani, where hundreds of people were arrested by police on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources and hundreds of thousands of organizers, demonstrated in the cold weather in the Danish capital at the occasion of the UN climate conference, aimed at entering into a Friday agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the conference on climate, said that the growing global mobilization, with clear evidence of the current demonstration, contributed to the "political tax" of any failure in Kodani would be too high.
According to the AFP journalist, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the beginning of the show, when a group of about 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, began to break the wear and tear.
The police immediately struck a major blow.
In total, the police reported the arrest of between 600 and 700 people and clarified that it was particularly the members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical independent groups, which appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "no difference" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in riots and sitting "in the streets still on Saturday night" and even during the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the cause of the peace was directed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate the building.
For the speakers, a stage was set before which there was a spiritual meeting at the candles with the participation of the former Archbishop of South Africa of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
Most protestors came by bus and train from large European cities and besides Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Korean.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue cloaks, created the first meeting in Kodani in the early hours of the morning, at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".
Today we go to the streets to demand compensation for ecological debt in favour of the south, explained People Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can no longer say that it is time for this to be proclaimed by the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa rivers and streams are drying up, we can walk in them today, and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the fight for the other world has approached environmental organisations.
French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for the other world, said he came to Kodana with the aim of "promoting climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for the other world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, some 50,000 people went to the streets according to the organizers.
There were hundreds of people in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes and dress that evoked the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators went into the streets, demanding an important measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the mob "350", especially in Paris, Marseille (them), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has chosen her president, Georgia condemns it as a "fresh"
Abkhazia chose her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as being independent of Georgia, Tbilisi is declaring this step "free".
About 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008 on control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed in 17 hours GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, a few hours before the elections were closed 58%.
The first preliminary results should be declared on Saturday night on Sunday.
All five candidates, including the President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of joining Georgia that condemned these elections.
These elections are fresh.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michail Saakashvili "sufferes that Abkhazia has fallen completely into the Russian domination," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory was recognized by 216,000 inhabitants only in Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it to be part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by the Russian army.
After a division from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to prove by elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said a letter from AFP Kvarčija Svetlanová, a 54th-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapša.
She was one of those who came to elect a schoolroom in the capital of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of the Russian government is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea, which can boast of a beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapš are located alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to observe the fair elections welcomed the warm reception of former mayor Beslan Arshby.
"We, Abkhaz, we are grateful," said at a small ceremony, meaning Moscow's support and in particular her decision to acknowledge Abkhaz's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, and added glass water to it.
The opposition, represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimbou and two traders Zaus Ardzinbo and Beslan Boutbo, criticised contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as an agreement that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he doesn't support the current government or the opposition.
In order to win the elections, the majority of 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive fight shall take place within two weeks.
Climate: World events, events in Kodani
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding an important and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, demonstrated around the world in Kodani, where the police arrested about 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and hundreds of thousands, reported to the organizers on the afternoon of the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts up to 18 December 193 delegates from the countries concerned, who could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the cause of the peace was directed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate the building.
For the speakers, a stage was set before which there was a spiritual meeting at the candles with the participation of the former Archbishop of South Africa of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, incidents occurred shortly after the departure of the pipeline, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black cells and armed bricks and warheads, began to break the costs.
The police immediately surrounded them and attacked them without waiting, while several protesters hit the ground.
In total, the police reported arrests of between 600 and 700 people and clarified that they were particularly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical independent groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Later this afternoon, a police officer on the jaw was wounded and four cars were incinerated near the quatch near the incidents that resulted from police sources arresting about 20 people.
We focus on extremist groups, warned speech police Henrik Jakobsen, while police helicopters flew into the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue cloaks, created the first meeting in Kodani in the early hours of the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".
Today we go to the streets to demand compensation for ecological debt in favour of the south, explained People Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.

French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for the other world, said he came to Kodana with the aim of "promoting climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for the other world".
The organisation Oxfam has called several well-known personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson to talk to the drug.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, some 50,000 people went to the streets according to the organizers.
In Manila, a number of hundreds of people, mostly students in red clothing, were protesting in front of the councillors of the capital city of the Philippines.
A number of hundreds of demonstrators also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta, requiring significant action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the mob "350", especially in Paris, Marseille (them), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The subjects of the geography and history will be strengthened within the framework of the reform of the general gymnasium, Chatel said.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel said on Sunday during a discussion for JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" under the reform of general gymnasiums, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the last year of the gymnasium with a focus on exact science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and will have the same program from general culture for everyone, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end hypocrisy," because according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on exact science" but "in essence, there are the best students in it".
EC and L specialization cannot be for any sub-specialisation, continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have complained that in the last year of the professional gymnasium there is no geography and history".
A survey by the agency Ifop, published on Saturday in the Journal of Humanity, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) did not agree with the government's project to abolish compulsory journalism and geography education in the graduation year with specialization S, which is why many intellectuals and teachers criticised both left and right MPs.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "does not come to mind" to abolish philosophy in the specialization program of the graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform in education for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and committees) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they considered to be offering educational training for future high school teachers.
Within the framework of Master's Study 2 (M2), the Minister explained at the beginning of the year the admission test aimed at their field and at the end of the year the further test verifying their ability to study.
The participants will be trained during the second year of the master's study, and the first year will be performed as a professor-internist before the students.
If you count all the internships that will be offered to you before the reception procedure, you will gain more experience with the students, almost 300 hours, continued .
The Minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which so far does not exist in national education.
Re-confirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite University of École normally superiors have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to the presentation of the Kodán Summit's goals: this is the challenge he announced in the meeting in the morning Jean Jouzel, multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) to encourage the University of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
According to one AFP journalist, Nobel Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conference, which is a one-day seminar composed of 15-minute expert contributions that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people, and based on what they should be more inclined to learn more, explained at the 22-year-old Edward Hanneso conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after the fish from the local pond, which was named the students.
It is estimated that twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected and clarified that the selection is based on their charisma.
About warming the climate "we can talk for hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, using graphs only.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that the listeners will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific basis".
The videos recorded on these lectures will be posted on the Web School since December 15.
The next Ernest seminar is scheduled for February and the next one will follow regularly every two months.
Delay in payments: anger of prison guards, planned measures
The Prison Supervisors' Committees announced "general mobilization" on Friday, as they demand that premiums and overtimes be paid to them for Christmas celebrations, which were for financial reasons postponed to ice.
Prison FO (2nd Board of Supervisors) asked employees who would not have the service to participate in a demonstration on Tuesday morning before the prison facilities and to "lock them" and thus to warn of "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd Section of this sector) has been called upon to "call for meetings in individual prisons and start basic mobilization" with the fact that it is "funny and unacceptable", so that the "times and charges for night work, Sundays and holidays" processed in October are not replaced in December.
First Boards of Supervisors, the Federal Union of Prison Oversight (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for total mobilization (...) to show discontent and frustration".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes has increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them have been included in the financial budget, but ensure that the amounts due will be repaid in January.
At the end of the day, the Office stated that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison guards' committees ensuring that the payment would be made next month.
I know about the efforts the prison staff is making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, and she writes to the ministry in her statement.
I have ordered the prison administration to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which arose by a poor assessment of the number of overtimes, has never been repeated in the future, adds to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Alliot-Mari.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of the management employees who receive the famous prizes for performing their functions and meeting the objectives, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those "the budget will always be the place".
It's just a scandal, the FO's interregional union in Marseille got upset and announced its decision to boycott to call "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays unless their allowances for these days from October are paid in December, as in the case of overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At a time when we are being given more and more jobs without having other personnel available, it is sad to allow the lowest employees to pay for this, says CGT prison supervisors in Bordeaux.
According to the committees, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better at it than others.
However, in any case of financial resources because of little, General Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
Obama claims he's giving "better gifts" on Christmas than those he gets
American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, has entrusted himself with the "bohni" screen of Oprah Winfrey, that as far as gifts are concerned, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get".
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday evening at ABC station about how they are going to spend Christmas and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-year-old partner of the family, will get his nickname.
Jesus likes Boa too, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog will also "of course" receive a gift, as it comes from the rumblings from the preliminary broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also defended herself against claiming her husband on the quality of gifts that she's getting: "No, of course not, I gave you the Prime Minister last year," said the president.
Well, of course it's true, he was forced to agree to the president, but immediately after he showed his finger on the pearl necklace of the first lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hourly very relaxed show with a famous moderator who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the husbands also talked to Obama about their most unpopular gifts they had as children.
Barack Obama set up a ten-degree gearbox, but also a basketball ball dedicated to him at the Christmas of his Kenyan father, with whom he met only very rarely.
I remember seeing my father come to see us on Christmas and giving me that basketball ball, the president told me.
Long after that, I realized that the ball actually gave me.
The first lady remembered the doll house again.
I didn't know how to organize it all in the cottage, so I fixed all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the bush, but that little doll house I loved, remembered Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operationed, RTL says he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was once again operated in Los Angeles because of the "damage" that he had undergone in France, but the situation was according to his closest "under control", while the RTL station indicated that the singer was in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was once again operated from Wednesday night to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found "damaging from surgery" of the damaged plots he had spent in Paris on November 26th, and reported to his press department in Paris that these lesions required "correction".
However, the singer's press department sought to calm the public and stated that the situation was "under control" and announced that new medical communications would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to prevent "sickness and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we'll have a little bit more certainty, he's delivering RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on the AFP's question.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a heated fence.
The surgery, which had been planned a few days earlier, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajux, a well-known doctor in the arts.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to express himself to RTL.
After this operation, Johnny Hallyday's singer was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for the infection that followed the attack.
Singer Eddie Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, said on Thursday in the RTL radio that his friend was just going through a "bad time", but he added that rocker "don't worry," because it's a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid, because spending 12 hours on the plane after such an operation is no fun, said Eddie Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the situation calmed down the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, who stated that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said he met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he didn't notice any special concerns.
The singer's health problems are only different from July when he was hospitalized for nine days after the fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to surprise everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on "a small tumor of a thin stomach" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour of Tower 66, which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every health problem has been very monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on the stage.
In mid-November, his team had to dement the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-way medalist at the 2009 World Cup in a large pool, won a title at the 2009 European Cup on Thursday in a small pool in Istanbul in a discipline that he especially likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, which last allowed combinations, only three world records fell, although many more were expected.
One of them won the Hungarian competition Evelyn Verrasztová to a 200 m position race and two remaining Russian male staff to a 4x50 m position race.
A great sadness for Bousquet, who was making a stopover on the world record in a 50 m free way, which is already the holder of a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal sailing disciplines, 50m free way, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20,53 seconds at the final, at which the prime minister started ten swimmers instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Crovat Duje Draganja (20,70) and Russ Sergei Fesikova (20,84), but failed to overcome the world record (20,30), as he assumed.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all sailors had combinations made of polyurethane that would be banned from 1 January.
The combinations helped from February 2008 to 238 world records, and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first host in 1999 to compete.
The use of the combination this time did not even help the Germans Paul Biedermann, a double world master in a large pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record on reach.
The young swimmer failed to win a record that holds 400 meters free (3:32.77), but won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian runner Nikita Lobintesev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in that race.
I knew I wouldn't beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent to the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: Romanian sarcophagus board belonging to Zol was exported for $1.5 million
The board of the Roman sarcophagus, which belonged to no one other than French writer Emil Zolvi, was exported on Thursday for $1.5 million, which is significantly more than estimated, said Sotheby ́s art trader.
The price of these two meters long and 63 cm high frontboards, from the third century of our annual count, was estimated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
Marble "representing four dionysian scenes in the elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satires and bakchants is a rare piece, similar pieces are very few, perhaps four or five in the world," AFP announced on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby ́s.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still taking place, but it's an object that has probably been brought to the attention of the AFP spokesperson Sotheby's, Dan Abernerthy.
The fact that Emile Zola ordered this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board was almost 300 years old in Rome in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then it gradually appeared to French actress Cecile Sorelova, with whom she refurbished a bath at her private hotel in Paris and to Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic of France and the short-term President of the Council before the entry into power of Lieutenant Petain.
She's been stuck there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz found in the search of the museum database in Louvre that this board was part of the "residues of Emil Zoly" opened since 1903, year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
A failed attempt to leave President Zelayi from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico ruled that the conditions for the carriage of Honduran President Manuel Zelayi, who the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure were not met.
After the telephone conversation I had with President Zelay last night, everything for the time being testifies to the fact that there is no way of carrying out this transport, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos, has introduced.
The Mexican government aircraft, which flew to El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelay, flew back to the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The government of the deserts wanted to get President Zelay to "demis" and to ask for political asylum abroad, only to allow him to leave safely.
But the rejected president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as a state exile.
The government of the deserts "successeded another failure when I wanted to give up my functions (...), wanted to give up the demise," Zelaya Radio Globe said on Thursday, which often expresses itself to the political crisis that has been taking place in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, he's added a deposed president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalp for two and a half months, and he's played a couple of accords.
Mexico's Embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior, Oscar Raul Matute, HRN's Honduran Radio.
I'm not going to ask for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelay in a telesur interview that has a seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as President of the Honduras People, he stressed.
The news of Zelayi's departure mobilized in the middle of a coup d'état, who came to gather around the Embassy of Brazil, where the army reinforced the defense.
Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the police government.
They show their marginal attitude to international standards, added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, was released on June 28th on the day he organised a public consultation in preparation for his re-appointment, against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned on 21 September and found refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he gets out of here, he'll be arrested and held accountable for the crime of the "great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
On 29 November, Pucisti President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold presidential elections to replace President Zelay.
In the controversial elections recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later Congress voted against the return of President Zelay to power until the end of his term of office on January 27.
Wall Street stands up, US business balance encourages optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the results of the US trade balance testify to the rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones earned 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average has improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
Index Standard & Poor 500 improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1102.35 points.
We have good news from various parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focusing on "half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors focus on the number of US trade balance, "which shows that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade balance fell by 7.6% in October against September, to $32.9 billion.
The analysts were expecting an increase in the ladder.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
Great news is the growing volume of trade, in particular exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the United States’ main trading partners, Christopher Cornell from the research firm Economy.com said.
In the United States last week, however, unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of jobseekers reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new employees has fallen "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The 10-year tax surplus increased to 3,482%, compared to 3,423% on Tuesday evening, and the return on 30 flights increased to 4,492%, compared to 4,408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of regime supporters wrote "Ladies in White"
Several hundred Cuban regime supporters wrote on Thursday a wife of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights and prevented further demonstrations to which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Dam in White", a wife or close political prisoners were posted directly on the street of the regime's representative Raula Castra on their departure towards the centre of the capital, demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist informed.
Go away with Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" were scanned with the raised fist of the regime's stand on dissidents.
Disidents were finally escorted by civilian personnel who came to "safety".
The day before, there was a similar demonstration in Havana against "The Ladies in White", but there was no injury or arrest.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, police officers were detained in a civilian area of about ten dissidents who were also going to protest on Thursday on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights, the AFP journalist informed.
According to this journalist, the police have imposed dissidents who have been drafted by government officials into civilian vehicles for the use of force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours.
The European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize holders, "The ladies in the white" organised an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissident, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind the grid.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "wages" or "agents" paid by their original enemy, the United States.
A final miracle, Cuban television reported on a Thursday's demonstration of the government's regime's supporters against the "responsors of the revolution".
Cuba with the Communist Party in the leadership and policy of the government of one party is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of not respecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
He killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
The madman, armed with two knives, killed an eighty-year-old man and wounded five other people in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an 80-year-old man in or before the hospital, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is a version of the police and witnesses.
Severely wounded old gentleman, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance police union in the hospital for the consequences of the injuries.
In this hospital or before, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband of about thirty years began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an eighty - year - old man died.
The lives of the other injured are in danger, according to police sources, likely vital authorities have been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," the police said.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as reported by the police, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He hurt two more people, probably a thirty-four-year-old man, the other seriously.
As it all happened, it's not quite clear, because it's all played in evening hours.
He was armed with two knives that carried a cross behind his back, said at the location of the Alliance's leading union in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several traveling men, including young people, have tried to stop and disarm, according to the testimony of the assembled AFPs.
I saw about a 30-year-old boy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation of Alberto, an artist from a nearby bar.
He threw himself a doodle, including one of the city policemen who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city policemen, including their commanders, tried to detain an armed man and were injured by his fists, reported the police source.
There was an incident in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
I've come to tell you that there's an injured person out there.
I went out and I saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big chest wound, told the agency AFP Frederic Allion, a 30-year-old doctor.
Five minutes later, about 30 years later, a second person came, who also had stab wounds.
A man who didn't have IDs arrested after the state police.
The State Representative in Nanterre transferred the case to the Investigation Department of the Regional Police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, waiting for questioning.
The police source didn't exclude his location in a psychiatric clinic.
Another police source stated that six police officers were needed to handle him at a police station in Clicha, where he was transferred.
He was "quite apart from himself" as "all the mad ones of this kind whose strength in action increases tenfold."
USA: Polish lawyer again requests the termination of the criminal complaint
Polish-French director Romana Polanski once again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to stop a criminal complaint against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to the moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the director of the film "Pianista" criticised before three judges of the second court of appeal in California a serious error that occurred during the trial in 1977.
I demand the arrest of the complaint now and now, said lawyer Hummel and added that from the conduct of the judge who then decided on the case, Laurence Rittenbanda "had an irritability in her back".
According to him, the judge (who had already died among them) was supposed to deal with a state representative who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – which is a serious offence against the rule of law.
Information on this interview was published in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski, sought and requested), by David Wells, the official representative himself.
But Mr. Wells finally announced by the end of September that he lied to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Judge Hummel will require a judicial hearing in which he will be able to provide evidence of his claim.
The complainant repeated what had already been said in the first state because there would be no serious investigation of the application for a suspension of criminal proceedings until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court issued a ruling on "illegal sexual intercourse" with an unaccompanied girl at the age of 13.
He's never been in the United States since then.
The prosecutor's representative in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asiayam, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to participate in the trial."
We want to prove in this case not only Roman Poles, but also another defendant that it is possible to escape?
It is the opinion that the director "requests favor and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to decide, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel wasn't the only one asking to stop Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also again asked for an end to criminal proceedings.
She reminded her client that it would no longer be a lasting challenge every time the Polish case was invented and she added, "No one in this room can say that the process was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland for US command
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to prison in his cabin in Gstaad, waiting for a possible demonstration.
Wall Street ends without direction, it's blocked by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market disappears between indicators that are better than expected in the United States and the rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended at 2,190,31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of the trade has decreased very much, and I think it will remain this way until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped to improve the market's mood as regards stability of economic recovery," analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, the retail market grew by 1.3% in November, which is already the second month after itself and much more than was expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, the confidence of US consumers also returned and grew sharply in December to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices have been fuelled by a new rise in the dollar price towards the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technological action thus loses ground under its feet.
The securities market has fallen.
The 10-year government income rose to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday evening and increased to 4.497% against 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World's election again in the South African Republic.
After a month's journey across the South African Republic, 112 candidates for Miss World's title on Saturday are going to go beyond the target time to reach their dream: to be elected by the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been taking place in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year, and for the time being, five candidates have gained access to the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acostaová from Mexico, Mariatu Kargboová from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were elected Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real faith of events.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things, and I have so many experiences!
The competition already taking place in the Republic of South Africa after the ninth, will be broadcast in direct transmission from Midrand, northern Johannesburg, from 17 a.m. (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country where I'd plant a crown.
It was fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could have experienced it twice, believed in Miss Xenia Sukhin's world in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the Republic of South Africa was in the spirit of frequent meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "countries that breathe".
After months of performances, trials, meetings with the press and safari, Miss now concentrates on her own competition.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes that he will go in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who will also take part in Aishwarye Rai, the 1994 winners, who both became Bollywood stars.
To be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about appearance.
We're slaves of my country and I want to come home with the crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates are presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The presentation will be presented by Chinese TV moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of Beauty of the Republic of South Africa Michelle McLean and the chairman of the Committee of the Miss of the World, Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that it is able to welcome the world with the warmth that it is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, President of the Miss World Competition.
The candidates, like last year, attended the safari, visited the famous town of Soveto, this time on the bike, and enjoyed local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
For the unusual president, Miss Sierra Leone.
There is no doubt that the most beautiful memory will remain the fate in Cape Town (southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010 and which helped the country to support something more.
I could've met people I didn't even think about.
I'm sure I'm going back to World Cup 2010, says with enthusiasm Miss Italia Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, the news about Hallyday is "very positive".
The news of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive", as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at Los Angeles, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The reports are very positive.
He's very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday on his departure from the plane he flew from Paris at 13 a.m. local time (21 a.m.)
The singer's son, who acted quietly, announced that he would be delivered to the Cedars-Sinaï Los Angeles hospital, where Johny Hallyday was accepted on Monday for a postoperative infection caused by the operation of a heated inter-bred platoon, which took place on November 26th in Paris.
According to a press release, the night sang in Los Angeles was because of the convenience of "introduction into artificial sleep", which is intended to prevent pain and facilitate the treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles already put into artificial sleep. Hospitalization was due to the infection following the operation of the warmed interbred plaque held on November 26th in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this attack , the singer had to be re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday at night .
According to a photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia attended the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, visiting their daughter Jade.
The department of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital la Pitié-Salpètrière, Yves Catone, announced that the singer to Los Angeles will fly on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphana Delajuxe, a neurosurgeon who performed on November 26th at the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were insurgents, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, I said.
Jean-Claude Camus is believed to have gone too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon.
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone, and he assured me that this trip was not a problem, which surprised me greatly, since I had already twice suffered the fever of the interstellar platoon.
Shortly before at the radio station RTL stated that the singer probably flew after a Paris operation without a drain, without anything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on the actress Maria Trittignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he then acted on.
He also operated on Charlotte Gainsbourg in 2007 when hematoma was removed, resulting in brain bleeding.
However, it is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times condemned in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
The doctor's lawyer, Olivier Metzner, called him "a man without a scratch", who is "regularly" summoned before the doctor's chamber, and who can't even "recommend".
After a few minutes of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajux made a statement on Friday about the matter through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had "a very good course" and the post-operative investigation was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, therefore the introduction of a drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer's health problems have grown since this year, and in any case it seems that his next tour remains with the question.
It is obvious that the date of the planned renewal of the tour on 8 January (Amiens, late red.) appears too close, said Camus.
The Association of UDF is raising the tone and calling on the New Centre side not to use their shortcut any longer.
The association UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançois Bayroua, responded on Friday to the attempts of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to involve briefly the former Giscards by not using in any media under the threat of criminal harassment.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to acquire a short UDF with François Bayro not entitled to carry her inheritance after he gave his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, was planning to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Movement Council of Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Mr Hervé de Charetta (formerly Deputy-UMP now as NC) who attributed the property of the UDF brand because he had it registered as the first in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la privété industrielle).
But on Friday evening, the UDF Committee of Friends of Françoise Bayroua, who do not intend to be allowed to stand out, spoke out of silence and formally requested the Minister and Members to stop using short sentences and return the property of the protective stamps, under threat of criminal harassment.
In recent days you have raised an alarming statement that you are proposing your political movement + to take over a short UDF, writes the Association in its letter to 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centrist.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the website of your move name+Nouveau center+, with the slogan +UDF today+, signatories also detect the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF Committee, which wants to immediately remove all mention of UDF names from all promotional materials including (their) websites."
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over the property of the trademarks to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will appeal to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories will notice.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is the full political movement of 1978" and remind that Mr. Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007, "to create a competitive movement, as well as others in 2002 to start the UMP.
The New Centre is therefore not entitled, according to them, to use a short UDF (Union for the French democracy).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to set up a committee to protect the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscardem d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charettea is concerned, the committee continues, "when it registered the trademark", it was "not a member of the UDF for three years", but a UMP.
In a scandalous and misleading way, he used non-existent acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This inaccuracy begins to turn into a criminal act, they declare, and then ironically they say to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in ordinary life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to come out of anonymity by misleading the acceptance of a name that we have no right to".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier and decide whether to use the state of weakness of an eighty billionaire to prepare her for part of her property, from which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt was guilty.
Photographer (62 years), known by his famous photographs, will be sued on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, which is a criminal offence for which a penalty of up to 3 years and a fine of EUR 375 000 is imposed.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a process in a case which can be identified as a family of the wealthiest families in France, where the mother is attacked with her daughter and is fighting for the management of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
At the same time, the 15th criminal court ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, who should conduct a college of three doctors.
The successor and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undertake such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State representatives in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 and, at the same time, submit a statement as to whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and what period.
I think she's gonna get her.
I'm going to talk to her about this. He made a statement after hearing Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
As for the lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Mayers, Oliver Metzner, the court's decision was welcomed.
This is an excellent report(...). Expertise will show that with this old lady who needs protection, he has been manipulating (M. Banier), confirming.
It's two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter started the criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographers and performers who blame her for having spent years on her mother's weakness to obtain a donation of a billion euros in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's pictures.
That's why Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of Mrs. Bettencourt-Mayers' claim, the Friday trial speech of lawyers with a moment changed in the family hour of truth.
Ms Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, expressing her distrust of her husband, François Bettencourt-Mayers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to a lawyer, said, "you could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years once to twice a day.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State representation in Nanterre again found that the complainant’s proceedings were not justified, namely that the supervisory judge in those days rejected her application to initiate proceedings for the issue of a legal remedy for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in the court, is not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for her," said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor's representative.
Finally, the Court has decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Mayers will be given permission at the time of the opening of the proceedings.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for economic intelligence development was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, he has recalled the behaviour of management of large companies towards employees in accessing companies to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to identify employees with the "values" from the mountains, as was the case before when the consumer had to impose products that were taken from the ideas of the head of manufacturing techniques.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolutions of the market acquisition strategy in the right direction...even though authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, are returning regularly!
Passive employee access can lead to mortal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much wider general phenomenon that affects mainly managerial frameworks.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and what is more important, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI "requires active access and predictability from all parties involved" and requires employees to make commitments that are completely contrary to the revenue of authoritarian management.
That's why we call for a managerial revolution, which should aim at bringing workers into the company's centre of interest as well as a client.
The relative usefulness of internal public opinion surveys.
Internal public opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that there's a new situation in the face of it, the structure, after all, will return to what she's always done!
Furthermore, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, is increasing moderately with the seriousness of its own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they're high school graduates for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of thought convenience, they are gaining an old behavioral theory, currently revitalized by "neuroconsciouss" from the United States and widely disseminated without greater knowledge by the scientific institutions and the media.
With the possibility to move "sic" the involvement of managers, he showed a recent survey of the agency Ipsos on Figaro.fr, which only establishes managers in their position of mechanical management that is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses is expected to adopt a final vision of human behaviour.
It is based on the inclusion of the basic approach in all purposes and practices of management: For employees, commitments to the company will be possible only if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of motivation for employees is only being studied Motivatingly functional analysis.
These studies have shown that the value of their businesses based on pre-defined doxa, which allows them to assess, through the image that it expresses about the company, what it offers to them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and introduce their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a living ground for the development of sound and effective economic intelligence.
The saying from Oslo: "Just war" made Obama deserve praise from the right.
US law on Friday welcomed Barack Obama's speech the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize holder for 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who first laughed at Obama's award on October 9th, this time the presidential performance, including Sarah Palin, was applauded by former candidates for Vice-President in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a museum of the right-wing Republican wing, for the U.S. Journal Today, and added that she herself expressed the "sometimes necessary" war in her memories, which are just coming out.
The war is, of course, the last thing the Americans would want to have to do, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo justified sending forces and used a speech to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, judged that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, thank you for the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the President's mention of the "existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech to be quite historical, Gingrich declared during the discussion on the radio "The Takeaway".
The former MP, whom some consider to be a potential Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was excited to see the "Lebend's President" remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee," that they themselves would not be free and would not be able to transfer a prize for peace if there was no use of force".
According to Michael Gerson, former speech author George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama has presented "very American speech".
Not only did he introduce himself as a "world citizen" as always, but he "spoke as an American president" and reminded the Europeans that they lived in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they didn't do too much to keep it," Gerson said.
Among the few right-wing dissatisfactions are Bush's Eurasians, the former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, who called the speech "one-on-one, rich and without inspiration", as stated on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the President, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is afraid of Barack Obama, as justifying the use of force.
"When we pack a war into a package of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the average left-wing press stands in favour of the president's commendable opinion.
Although the Los Angeles Times continue to consider Obama's award of peace as premature, he considered his performance as a "survivor" and so on for a speaker known to be his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as an indication of international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily said.
Obama "declared what was needed," assessed the New York Times, and marked it "for simple and instructive".
Road transporter: three marathons to an agreement that saves the supply of supplies on Christmas.
After three marathons, the Road Transport Committees and the Tlf, the only organisation of employees who remained until the end of Friday evening, came to an agreement that ended the call for a stand and threat that hung over the supply of supplies on Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, when signing the Friday agreement, expressed "joy" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night discussion, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning hoping that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
And yet three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned from the process.
But there was a need for more than six hours of meeting that started in 11 hours to all agree and in 18 hours of signing the agreement.
This conflict "would be very damaging to businesses" and "dangered to disrupt holidays at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The text contains an increase in wages by 4% in the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% in the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly salary for the lowest salaries is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a lot, but there's a lot of effort behind it, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight, we give our members an order not to come to the locks, no blockage of the supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right agreement", although it was difficult to admit the increase in high wages due to international competition ".
According to him, there is an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and between 100 and 120 euros for the highest.
It is a healthy understanding agreement and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for a 3% revalidation of travel expenses and a report on the state of the road transport situation in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for focus on the issue of wage 13 and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million in corporate wage taxes" which was the subject of the government's amendment to the draft budget law for 2009, which was voted on on Thursday night to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate to vote in favour.
The signature enables this agreement to apply first to undertakings which are members of this organisation, later on to the whole sector, in the case of expansion by the Ministry of Labour.
They will be implemented "in the shortest possible time", busseau assured.
The whole process can only detract from the disagreement of employers' organisations.
The FNTR organisation is talking about "bad trade" because EUR 100 million "has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation".
The State Secretary for Transport has forced us to conduct an urgent procedure, not as a result of mutual analysis, but as a result of the fact that he did not see the dishes of the flock in the coming Christmas season, Unostra complained.
For the organisation of the Second, the agreement in the next 12 months threatens to "decompose large quantities of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector".
Intermodal trains RER A: interruption of the weekend transport, the committees are not satisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The stopover of the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest urban bulk transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the board and the management of RATP on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the premium application.
On Saturday and Sunday, the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only drive between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (between La Défense and Nation) will drive every other train, except this section only one train of four.
The connection to SNCF will be interrupted at Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will thus be forced to switch to another train.
The Galeries Lafayette business houses, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP has tried to secure links with large business houses".
Link RER A leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP is from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, a train with two trains was in operation and virtually no combination was released at the time, as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France were different and there was no confusion on the scene.
So early in the morning there were many fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, including because of the lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he stood up for "an hour and a half early to make sure he was coming in time".
The Saint-Lasare mission was not overfilled, the SNCF State Railway announced, and a larger number of officers and officers were predicted.
The RER A bus trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut came or departed from Saint-Lasare Station with a metro connection.
The next valid meeting of the incumbents will take place on Saturday and Sunday, on which the results of the Friday afternoon meeting will be evaluated with the management that the committees considered to be "weak".
The management of RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER and, on all sides, adjustment of working hours, careers etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a merit award according to Thierry Garon (OdboryJih).
For the time being, RATP has even postponed proposals for the premium, which has aggravated the CGT by the fact that the management "was not able to solve the problem while in the case of passenger carriers and SNCF it was".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "closer examination of the conditions of performance of the profession", RATP stated the transport companies.
Which was why the experts think the company "makes weekend travel fun".
In the morning, about 150 drivers settled the business committee in its Paris settlement.
The management, which has so far refused any discussion during the course of the term, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of 'relief'.
The danger is that the conflict will spread on Tuesday also on the RER B line, after Unsa and Independent will notify the emergency.
The Boards shall apply for a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Independents (Independent)) and shall be charged against the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which shall carry millions of passengers on a daily basis.
The RER train drivers make a further career of 2200 to 2700 euros gross wages and 600 to 650 euros premiums for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice has resolved for the Kurdish side, and this decision is having serious consequences.
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court decided to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately sparked protests in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end the 25-year conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DPP) has been dissolved because it has become "a backdrop of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when the majority-seven votes were required to dissolve the party, Kilic stated that 37 side chairs, including her President Ahmet Türk and Ms Aysely Tugluková, are not allowed to take part in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Ministry of Finance.
DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 500).
The leadership of the party has already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political jurisdiction in it.
The decision is to continue the trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organisation.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legal political display of the PKK rebels.
The Party shall ensure that the PKK has no "basic link", but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit Kurdish support to the PKK and to end this conflict.
The DTP has confirmed that the resolution of the party could lead to the restoration of tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations have been cast against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan has been detained in police meetings.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large town in the southeast, mostly the Kurds.
The police used tear grenades and watercraft, demonstrators threw Molot's cocktails again or shot rocks out of the trenches.
There were about a hundred people in Istanbul, too.
After delivering the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of justice is only "increasing despair".
Turkey is unable to resolve this question (Kurds, see footnote) by banning the party, it has declared in press.
The government formed by the party removed from the Islamic movement also condemned this decision.
We're out of principle against the interference of the parties.
There's nothing to do, the Minister of Energy has announced Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete shot at the democratic proposals launched by the government, said Politologist Ahmet Isle.
Of course we can wait for PKK response, added.
On Thursday, the PKK joined one of the most violent attacks on northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days ago.
Snow may come
It's a very chilling winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass citizens, says the head of the FES winter department of technical services.
But that's why his staff can test and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
It could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
It is equipped with over 300 employees and 120 vehicles to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is therefore acting in accordance with the exact plan.
As soon as it snows completely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, they will go to 20 so-called sections and large-scale, Brauburger explains.
These sections include the main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, lines of suburban public transport, pedestrian zones and sections with descents like Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to absorb moisture salt for a maximum of three hours, which is better held, about 1040 kilometers.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "so that roads are free when transport to work begins".
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "because no one is willing to make room for sleepers."
Only when it is not so low are there a number of incoming and connecting communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll complain there.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian will go on the road, and dangerous places and transitions will be cleared.
Most FES cannot take care of all bicycles.
There's a special service in Frankfurt that monitors from 22 to 4.30 bridges in particular, says Brauburger.
Since they have a fast ice cream, they leave the bed as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, they'll call the police.
Dinosaur shell
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other massosome dinosaurs: animals two meters long and a half feet high ran after two strong rear limbs, had a weak skull with sharp, swollen teeth, short frontal limbs with sloppy drops and a long tail.
If this kind of thing lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be anything extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday issue of Science magazine wrote that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in New Mexico today, which was then in the equatorial dry area of the Pange supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the previous evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the relationship, the expansion and the signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day, we found tens of thousands of dinosaur bones, which is invisible for triassic implants, reports a member of Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains were collected from a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms the theory of early dinosaur history.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual finding: "The fossils of triassic dinosaurs are very rare, most will find only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this excitement without exception.
Especially sensational is not this finding, but it confirms some theories about early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the addition of the ancestors is most controversial.
Experts are discussing, for example, when the octopuses were divided into three of the most important development lines: mass-eating therapies, which later belonged to the Tyranosaurus reg, Velociroptor and birds, "long-circumbing" four-surapods and their relatives, and the beeswax of Ornithechia (ptacopenia), which belonged to, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is an original therapist after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers have found, for example, evidence of airbags that also have offspring of bird therapists.
Airbags make bird breathing more effective than mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the feathers were obviously partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive air vacuum therapy, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of the huge surapods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation has probably created a common front for both groups.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because so far the most primitive dinosaurs have lived in South America, scientists have exported that they have discovered themselves for the first time.
According to this, three development lines were divided early and spread from South America to all continents that then formed a single earth mass as the supercontinent of Pange.
She would also talk about the fact that the team together with Tawa Hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related therapies.
The three cannot come from a common immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also disputes.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which is part of a group of the hardest dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says Bonbon paleontologist Martin Sander.
His idea could give a painted picture together, because in South America many primitive fossils of dinosaurs remain, and on other continents there are rarely.
As dinosaurs have shown, from the relatively rare sideline of the family of the beaches, they have developed into rulers of the earth during the Middle Ages, it remains a mystery.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lakes and countless other lakes.
At the end of the triacea, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while relatives died and the triacea and juries were dissected.
The History of Success Has Not Lasted Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been mass measurements that dinosaurs had accidentally survived, but the beach didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could push the competition.
The history of success did not last forever anyway.
About 150 million years later, another group of animals, which had also developed into a triacea and lived in the shadow since then, were affected.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
Professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, São Paulo, Berlin, or Brém joined.
Police clearance of Frankfurt Goethe University's occupied casinos has taken care of the global dissatisfaction.
278 professors and teachers at Goeth's universities, as well as high schools throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with Protestant students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, "they do not approve" by the president of the police force.
Because there were numerous walls and works of art, University President Werner Müller-Estler allowed us to clean up the building that was planted last week by standing students and lecturers.
At the time, five students were injured.
The damage done, the signatories judge, does not justify the "violent dissolution of self-organized training of students and police officers".
Cleaning is an "unacceptable measure" to freedom of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves as an "injustice and criminalisation of protest" and distracts attention from content.
The Bureau has avoided the necessary discussion.
The rapporteurs call for a suspension of criminal proceedings.
It is claimed that the majority of the incumbents did not support material damage.
Verified protest
Also young experts from the Verdi and the German board association are solidarityd with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says the secret Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessen Ministry of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far advocated the procedure of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the university president.
The destruction and siege are totally unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in Current Hour (Current Hour) in Wiesbaden County.
We have an understanding for the protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, the MP of the Earth's Record said for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise they saw the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Link.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and the requirements of the students, there has been a cleanup.
Linke submitted a proposal calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it paid for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the west.
Zelengrad, one of the ten periods of Moscow’s capital, in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded location where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this period is considered to be 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and manufacturing centres are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of the Green Town have contacted the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the University institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
A number of mutual visits were made and signed in Frankfurt Zeenograd and Ridberg on Wednesday's "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's mayor, Jurij Rosljak, and the prefect of the Zeenograd Anatoli Smirnov, who signed the head planning rapporteur, Edwin Schwarz, for Frankfurt.
In 2010, FIZ representatives and small and medium-sized enterprises will go to a seminar in Zeenograd.
Scientific exchange
It's a temporary scientific exchange.
It's also about economic relations.
FIZ will be able to capture on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get orders in Germany.
Zelenagrad is the seat of important Russian research institutions and companies.
Among them are the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies of Citronics and the Russian Electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for armed research.
Greengrad (a literal translation of "Green City") has acquired its name according to the forested mining landscape in which the research facilities are installed.
Stuttgart Brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension can't be prepared at all enough.
For the project beneficiaries, it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than the launch of the station, more than the monster building that will throw the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade into a desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 1980s.
The main stations with the trains that ended in the city centre were then considered transport-technical fossils in the 19th century, which act as brakes for modern rail transport, because it took enormously long to get the locomotives from the front.
Take a moment to stop, keep going - so it should work.
And that's why the main station is missing, in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the train station, which lies about half the route of the trans-European railway magistrates between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that's why the slogan of "the heart of Europe" is.
It actually starts with S21, although the 80s vision is no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves recognized that the start of the building in Hessen and Bavarian capital is almost non-financial.
Since the existence of modern hydraulic trains with motor and driving vehicles at both ends, there have been no problems with driving and driving.
However: Stuttgart is beginning 21 including a new ICE route to Ulmu.
They planted it in local and municipal politics.
Roads cooperate, even because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is a taxpayer rather than a state group.
Urbanistly, the project can be excused in some other way.
There will be a new city space that - if we believe computer images of designers - will contain a lot of green.
The S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The train station and track construction are intended for passenger transport, which, typically in the 1980s, has attributed enormous growth.
There was no competition for cheap flights at the time.
Modern transport policies must, however, go first and foremost to strengthen freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight cars on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to a rapid climb.
More importantly, S21 is directly involved in many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Switzerland.
That's an official number.
Experts believe it's real ten to 15 billion.
Clearly, in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other catch points and narrow grid sites.
There are sixty major projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometers long route to the Rýn Valley.
Since 1987, the pace has been slowed down on this route.
There's a need for a proper push here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The track of the Rhine valley will become the throat of the international freight transport bottle: directly in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment of the airport
The Land Government left open in Wiesbaden's Landing Snow whether it was opposed to the judgment of the Hessen Court of Justice (VGH) on the prohibition of night flights and allowed it to be audited.
The CDU/FDP Coalition has entrusted experts with legal review of more than 400-page VGH judgment, Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today has written reasons that the state would have to re-adjust the night ban in the case of the construction of the planned northwest margins of the Frankfurt airport.
A permit of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as assumed by the Land Government, does not comply with the law governing the protection of the population from night noise.
Coalitions shall be decided by 4 January if they require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this delay and appealed to the government's representative to reject the revision of the General Administrative Court in Lipsk.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel group called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises regarding the night ban that they gave before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to evaluate it as "the breach of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said the Chief of Green Tarek Al-Wazir in opposition to the FDP "We hold our word".
Minister Posch refused to stand up to Schäfer-Gümbel, the land government is trying to get to its night flights through "transgression of law and trickery".
Precise legal control takes time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on the "fast first impression".
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The years of his group for banning night flights were never the same as the opposition.
U.S. Banks Paying Aid
American, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America paid back on Wednesday aid from the Tarp Savings Fund totaling 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros).
According to the report by the American station CNBC, Citigroup also plans to pay for state aid.
The institutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions on the adoption of money - a restriction on the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America's investors made a fortune of $19 billion in cash due to a variable bond.
The rest of the amount was taken from its treasury, which was filled, among other things, by trade union sales.
The bank chief, Kenneth Lewis, thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: Money injections helped us overcome a difficult time.
The monetary institution has damaged itself at the top of the financial crisis by taking over the Merrill Lynch investment bank.
Citigroup wants to get rid of its obligations to the state by also making money on the capital market.
The CNBC informed by appeal that this US bank could have announced a capital increase of about $20 billion on Thursday.
The Citigroup spokesperson didn't want to express himself.
In June, they paid for the aid already Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
It just went faster than expected.
The station presented the successor only two weeks after the ZDF's board of directors had been expelled from the office of Chief Professor Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the jury wanted to deal with that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF study in the capital of Berlin, was named for his favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially not to prevent the process.
However, the role could also be played if they did not want to harm ZDF Lieutenant Markus Schächter if this proposal did not go through with the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs support from nine of the 14 members of the panel.
The result of the vote was not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he broke into Schächter's Governing Council with his proposal to extend the agreement with Nikolaus Brander for another five years.
Brender's loss of the mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although she could be expected.
The majority of the Union members of the Governing Council have already reported a few weeks before the elections that they do not want to confirm Brander at the office.
The resistance to the governor was organised by Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He rejected further delay in the Office of the High Representative's argument that, for Brender, the quotas for monitoring the ZDF broadcast had fallen.
As a result, until shortly before the election there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was strongly criticised.
Finally, even 35 state lawmakers were involved in the debate, who considered the Koch process to be anti-constitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, teaching and romance.
Then he worked for Southwest Funk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the heat-journal.
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 Personal Rapporteur of the Secretary-General; 1991/92 by letter in Washington; until 1998 by leader and moderator "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 by leader of the ZDF foreign policy; since then by head of the ZDF main study.
After Brender, who had been elected a media magazine on Wednesday to the press for the year, the season was announced to Greens that they had filed a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opposition to the Governing Council, Rīnsk-Falk Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the authorities should amend the state agreement with ZDF in such a way that the intentional staff proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party policies from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's alleged successor, Peter Frey, advised the board of directors of the smart chess team - immediately after Brender's meeting, he strongly criticized the body for this.
As a result of this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him without losing face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the board without suspecting that the party would be pushed into the office.
In lateral arithmetic, Frey is not so classed as left liberals.
The study is free of harampads
A partial success for students: After the year of the placement, the Ministers of Culture finally went to the social media on Thursday: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors, both parties agreed that it was their will to improve the study conditions for bakers and magistrates.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of testing: In principle, each study module should end with one single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed, and "real and defensive peace" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and high schools want to simplify the recognition of tests between high schools in Germany and abroad.
The national authorities undertake to create more flexible joint structural tasks for the bakery and master's study fields.
The land derogations should cease to exist.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of student protests in the worm, ministers of culture and university teachers have had words in their mouths about better study.
They are now filled with concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council found that the number of trials in part is drastically reduced: "Every module will usually be completed only once," says the 30-page report, which is intended to partially re-regulate the approval of the fields of study.
"A significantly lower test burden," said President of the Reinhold Grimm Accreditation Council, "is intended to "stop the wrong development that significantly limited the difficulty of the study."
To this end, the "tendency of the study" will be in the future "decisive criterion" in implementation.
Modules and content "must be strictly checked" so that "excessively limit students in the choice
Seminars."
Students should have "a space for offering and supporting their own initiative".
The rules are to be applied when adopting new fields of study, after examination, but also for existing fields of study.
You need to "recredit" every five years – which means that it will last until 2015 before all study fields are reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to the accreditation councils set up by the partner countries.
In October, the cultural ministers called on the "significant" community countries to act on agencies so that the full learning was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In each community country, universities and high schools have already agreed on appropriate measures with the Land Ministries.
As yet, the only country has promised to provide additional resources for further development of the Bologna Process.
The money should be used by high schools to build consultation programmes and study councils, and to strengthen experimental and foreign offices.
They want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to give Parliament a new law on higher education.
According to it, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
Study training should be even more flexible, the recognition of tests from other high schools should be guaranteed and the access of the Master should be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all study areas in the country should be reviewed.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the study conditions in the country.
There was also criticism of the resolution next to the praise.
The public representation of the Juso High School Groups called for the creation of education policy not to be played in the future "closed doors" of ministers and high school principals.
At the latest, students as well as the individuals concerned should "speak at least a word" to that effect.
The future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: "We need students' experience", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom the HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Committees on Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution was not far enough: they require a legal requirement that would allow every graduate with a bachelor's degree to access the building master's study.
Secondly, the authorities have to ensure that for today's generation of Bachelor's students there will be enough seats tomorrow in master's study rooms with the best study conditions, said a member of GEW Andreas Keller.
Social countries must employ far more lecturers.
But the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves freely in the master's programmes.
More than a note under the spell of Hert Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." the opening line of one poet, Werner Söllner, who, in this torn-out piece of language, discusses the experience with the arrival of a dissident who has gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Romania, worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of a children's bookstore, then moved to Frankfurt nad Mohan in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he taught poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the leader of the Hessen Literature Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
On a significant minimulatory riot, he took care of last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts".
Obviously, the notorious and infected Söllner left a statement in which, in front of his colleagues, Romanian writers, such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, admitted to co-operation as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Security.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German language prize in 1989.
In 1971, attempts to recruit began unscathed.
I'm, Söllner continued, "then someone who hasn't resisted enough attempts to scare security."
Writer Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time with the award of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller and her unsuitable literary arrangement with the dictatorial government mechanisms is a literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, shaken by a case that denotes the depth and shame of the political system based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner isn't, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, just the offender, but he's also a victim.
In the act of Security, secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of secret agent Walter himself.
"He cut me off" then in all the major points for him, says Markel.
I have a moral duty to make this note.
Söllner's statement was in this form and before this audience was unexpected, but it is not entirely surprising that the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service was acknowledged.
Herta Müller wrote already in July when she read her own act, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Security spikes.
Touch, you can assume, they'll speculate and in some cases they'll probably even know what name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voic and Walter as well.
Unlike in a foreign country, however, the very certain viewing of the Stazi files is still very diffuse with the rest of the security control.
In recent years, systematic education has been designed and restricted.
One of the Birthler Offices, which is responsible to the National Council for the processing of Security Components (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, the adoption of an act has been carried out for longer than that time.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of files.
The fact that the former members of the Security Council still have great influence in Romania has been reported after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller's one interview, in which one of the former headmen of the Security from Temešvár expressed himself as the bearer of the award in a negative manner.
He's got psychosis. She was finally interrogated only once.
The subjugation of power was expressed in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Söllner, as in the case of a silent pardon, there are inevitable questions.
The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes it expected that the continuation of this chapter will be more determined by the desire for knowledge than by the dedication of guilt and cold.
To the genetics of Herty Müller, who took the Nobel Prize yesterday, it's more than a note under magic.
Filled deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed trade representative came from a lovely Christmas party at which the manufacturer of the sports goods of sweetness, when he arrived at the fourth hour after midnight in the required Mercedes class C new coach VfBr Christian Gross in the follow-up of the orange colored bag of the sponsor.
A man with a brand-new dance allowed him to take another city after him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - the alcohol was not in the game, and fortunately the 55-year-old man was too little.
It was a good evening, but tomorrow he'll keep on working.
Or it's just getting started.
The words of only three days of Switzerland's engagement: "We reached the eight-finals", because in the Champions League thanks to the victory3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be swayed by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against accession."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mohuči as well as in the ordinary league days.
And prevent the repeated obvious weaknesses after three quick goals of Maricy (5), Träsche (8) and Pagrebnyak (11).
Placing
The Osmifinals Champions League (run 16/17. + 23/24 February/vocational win 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be held in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of Babel’s crash will be preserved.
Not only in the case of the supposed healer, who, during a short time of self-awareness, added to the non-realist Stuttgart professionals the willingness to play and the joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on their strong pages and I encouraged them to be more courageous, explained the soul healer Gross so simply a successful recipe, which, however, did not prove any effectiveness due to the operation of Babble’s therapist.
He fancied some magic, admitted Babbel's associate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes to the football, there are sometimes things that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after the many-week break caused by the injury, became immediately the best player in the field, tried to describe the discovered "phenomenon" by a provocative "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new superior: "He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Babble's obviously missed it.
VfB Stuttgart hasn't been saved yet, sports president Horst Heldt warns.
VfB Stuttgart needs more stamina.
Like Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against a weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of a Romanian guest.
They would win even in Glasgow before there came a terrible awakening after defeat 0:4 in Leverkeus, Khedira thinks.
And sports president Horst Heldt reminded me that there was one goal in the season, but the other is still far away.
We're not in the water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home victory after three months was caused by weekend events that freshly relived in the form of a television conversation with banner Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that affect others and not Jens, Heldt has condemned Lehman's firm criticism.
He prevented the performance from leading weakly and decided to change the coach after pressure from the pubertal fans.
Even the cancellation of his day off after the games marked Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehman's statements "promulgates pure selfishness", he accused Heldt and announced the consequences to the bankers.
They're not going to have any joy in their lives.
Anyway, they're behind each other that without the work of the trained team, it wouldn't be possible to have such a strong and combat performance.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share in success," said Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the needle bag agrees.
Fighting World Championships in a Heavyweight
The Vassive Duel in Bern: The Challenger Kevin Johnson has always provoked the words and gestures of the world's master Vitalie Click.
After 12 hard wheels, however, Ukraine defended its title in the heavyweight of the WBC boxing organization.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Click remains the master of the world in a heavy weight box.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat Bern American Kevin Johnson on Saturday night in a single point (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Clicka it is the third successful defence of the title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine was twice the world's champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen that everyone was expecting.
The click improved its balance to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice for injury.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena drove 2,02 meters high Click battle primarily with their left.
About 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced before the duel the end of the Cliché era, but had fallen before the impact of the world's champion, so the Cliché could not establish a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
Overall, the passive Johnson on the challenger did little and he was just trying to get to the next round.
The call provoked words and gestures, but the world's champion struck only a few times.
But even so, it's only the second boxer after Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klikka full twelve rounds.
The challenger took care of the riot in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted the Click as "resistant zombies," which "can't do anything properly."
During the ride on Friday, the champion got provoked, pulled Johnson out of the nose of the sunglasses, "so that he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Click return
The call remained unbeatable after the fourth battle after its return on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of stopping, he defeated in Berlin the Nigerian Samuel Peter and took back his "wBC" belt, which had to give up without a fight before.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba in protests and Chris Areola from the United States in September.
In this fight I only got one wound and physically in good shape, justified the click quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
But the WBA belt carries Brit David Haye, after sitting in November from the throne of 2,13 meters high of Nikolai Vulayev.
Haye refused in the summer a battle against Clickk, which was planned for September.
He is allegedly planning his promotional company to fight Click at the Wembley Stadium in London.
Kundúz case
Front attack from the opposition: The head of the Green Jürgen Trittin Group has marked for bad information about the affair Kundúz Minister of Defence Gutenberg as a liar.
SPD and Linke (Levice) call on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings on Kundúz, the opposition is of the opinion that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) has admitted a conscious slander.
The minister for the death bombing of two tanks said "consciously false", said the head of the Green Group Jürgen Trittin in the ARD "Tagesschau" Saturday's report.
Let's call it the usual expression: Lhal.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the International Security Support Force (ISAF) rules.
That is the essence of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday it was reported that the attack was not just about the destruction of the stolen trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
At the U.S. invasion by German commander Kundúz Colonel Klein, it was reported that up to 142 people were killed or injured by NATO.
The Greens, the SPD and the Linke called on Angel Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express herself immediately before the Colombo film and also to explain what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel needs to explain whether the strategy for the targeted killing of part of the Afghan policy of the General Assembly - and whether the Office of the Chancellor, Bundeswehr and the rapporteur approved this new strategy, called for Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from Green Renate Künastová.
Ulrich Wilhelm's speaking governments have certainly rejected criticism.
The Office of the Chancellor has no influence on the particular deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there was also a statement of doubts about the department's assessment of the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Gutenbergs were informed correctly and fully of the background of the tank attack.
It was officially announced that they should deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the Minister for Sensitive Details.
However, in the vicinity of both top officials, it was reported that the Ministry of Defence had warned even a few reports, including a two-sided document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeineer Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have applied in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any answer so far.
The Ministry did not comment on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the polling committee of the General Assembly, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in a watchful state and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
Not only are mentally ill or drug addicts interfering with imagination and reality.
As long as it's in bed, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may be surrounded by the wildest ideas and fantasy crowd.
However, those who experience a state of mind, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, pay most in today’s Western world for madness or drug addiction, or at least as a freak.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in psychotic patients or in drug addicts.
The fault is our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, are here and there making sure that they fulfill the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality.
Dreams changed state of consciousness can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst error.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, however, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castanedy, the shaman state of bloating, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or vision will occur if the balance of neuronal brain transmitters - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is eliminated and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and misconceptions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity doesn't have much to do with it.
The connection between error and sleep has been employed by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in the wake, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, found in 1861 "a great similarity to bloating with dreams," for Sigmund Freud was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, overcrowdedness, deception of meaning".
It's the fall of 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and crimson-colored.
Gravitation over him has no power, he boasts at the ceiling of the room.
It's a feeling of excruciation.
He's got a bunch of bloody fucking faces with blood-red grimases, precious teeth.
They chase him, they dig into him with heavy, fiery boots, they throw him over the wall, they feel pain all over the body.
Loud, bad voices are threatening out of the wall and out of the radio.
He can't bear the voices that they're giving him and insulting him anymore.
Henning T. will pull two cables out of the stereo, take them into the loop and pin it onto the ceiling hook.
He'll go up to one of the speakers, and he'll put his shirt around his neck.
Jumper.
Smick's gonna let you.
Learn, the noise of the congregation blowing his drums, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be treated!"
Today is Henning T. 40, experienced six acute psychos, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was released.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, besides maniodepressive, taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
I've experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts in psychosis, he says.
The Ghosts Are a Terrible Reality
Approximately one percent of people suffer at least once for their lives from schizophrenia, and in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most people can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer world, get into an exaggerated state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or illusions of persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The injured person is unable to distinguish important from the minor, the brain cannot filter out the disturbing signals, consciously the senses are flooded.
Just as a dream opens the psychosis of a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest kinds of consciousness.
The perception of the reality of psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at Heidelberg University Psychiatry Clinic.
Schizophrenic is located in the center of the event, everything has meaning directed towards it.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overpowered by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics are therefore often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not possible most of them, the ghosts are terrible, the awakening is excluded.
One for life to experience hallucinations
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "but the sense and spatial structure of reality that a person perceives in psychosis remains essentially preserved."
Bloody thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to cut off the experience is in real terms.
The scientist's still in the middle of an argument, why exactly our brain is doing this kind of transformation.
Extraordinary states can lead every human to lose a relationship with reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
Not everyone turns to psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies in the twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that the disabled have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development, brain damage, such as maternal viral disease during pregnancy, is explained by Fuchs.
But it remains to be expected that there will be a breach of the neuronal system, which has not shown itself for many years.
Roles also play influences around - stress or traumatic experiences may be the initiator of psychosis if available.
hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain's turned upside down
Crazy is that psychotronics suffer with their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we view overcrowds as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a question of attitude.
Casten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and overcrowds for ten years, in last year he interpreted his results in the book Die irreale Welt in our Kopf.
Hallucination, however, is one of the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also a surprising number of other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, such as migraine, epilepsy, spread sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma.
Surprisedly, it is under certain conditions, even the brain of a healthy person.
Hallucination, according to Casten, consists of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when parts of the brain in which mental perception is processed are too active or slightly depressed; if our brain is failing, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of incentives, stress, concerns about love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Predínsk and going to the darker gymnasium.
Actually, a completely normal girl.
If there weren't those pictures and voices.
On breaks, it may be that she will be told to kneel with long, dark hair.
When he answers, they look at her with surprise -- nobody else but her sees and hears this boy.
This brave girl thinks she's a drunk dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't, she knows.
He's up, he's hearing and he's seeing the boy, just like he's hearing and he's seeing a girl sitting next to him in the van.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, the boy likes it.
Am I crazy? She asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other freaks aren't real and he's going to disappear again.
In the night, the sights are more appealing.
There's a lot of overcrowding.
When sitting in the classroom, he cannot follow the course many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just a new associate, but he explains everything else in a hearing and visual way on the table of the mathematical equation.
In the night, the appearances are more appealing.
While waiting in her dark room for a sleep that comes rarely and too late, she cannot often tell whether she is awake or if she is already asleep, whether the images she sees, the grizzles, or the girl with bleeding stab wounds on her hands and feet appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, screaming at those figures.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it. They'd think she was crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vloni has graduated from high school and lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she got in touch with a psychologist named Casten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she didn't go crazy.
Overcrowding is also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is encouraged, he will have a very likely hallucination, says Casten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough work to do, and it takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., a single girl, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she found out in 13 that the man she's been calling her father since she thought she was not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish error and reality from themselves. "Every experience," says Kasten, "plays in the brain, reality is also shown there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain appear, so it works so real."
Also, night dreams evaluate Casten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucination of healthy people does not differ in principle from hallucination in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mental health people are able to identify their mistakes as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as extraordinary abilities.
Border position between sleep and hallucination
In our world too concentrated on consciousness, the imaginary experience is unfortunately pathologicalized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and head of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinics of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creativeness - overcrowding is also art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneuropedic form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness into dreams.
On-europed states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person concerned considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them from the state of alert.
Oneuropedic consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradicular infection who are fully aware of motor protection.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps by a lasting, complete inability to move, replaces life threatening the real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of borderline between sleep and hallucination.
Because it is not really possible to deal with a situation, world change comes, but the real situation is present.
The intensive form of support for the meanings and the transfer of meanings into some unbearable situation that enables us to pass our own ability to form, during the moment to the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his on-earth experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of Hearts) as a saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after surgery, his heart was transplanted with his subsequent heart, and his body was still in intensive care.
Claussen dived into the world that he had created, visited foreign times and places: He became an old man on a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watching his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the blizzards who produce misleading substances from the blood.
On the bike, the river will take him to its authority, surf the firm in the Alps and meet the Korean Mafia.
It's submerged completely into the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These internal routes for Claussen are essentially different from any dream.
A dream is a different state, describing its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are clear after years and in little detail.
Even clearer and more intense than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, they show the on-europed states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug addictions, how fragile our internal image is in the wake of reality.
Every change in consciousness, the psychologist Casten sums up, "can lead to the deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow may come
Burda
At 27 take over the children's loading
The new Kallen truck is a transitional solution: For a long time Hubert Burda wants to transfer his business into the hands of his two children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding is also to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Charger Hubert Burda sees his company for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit in 27 years of age and have a strong will to enter the company, says a 69-year-old man named SPIEGEL.
We've carefully solved the details.
The question is, if they are also active in the company, then it's up to you.
And the question is if they have the ability to do this.
It is not possible to put in front of 7,500 employees of their children unless they are capable enough.
It would kill both children and business.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he had retired from the presidency since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the performance at Burdy since 1999.
First, he was worried about technology.
Later, the Treasury added responsibility for the company's assets and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's resignation, direct marketing, Cisina, Press and Finance also took over.
For the first time, none of the family members are in charge.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Callen's appointment also serves to "excuse 10, 15 years," said Burd.
Holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
In view of the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that no family businesses had any certainty before the ban: "It has always happened to companies that have become obsessed with the desire for capital that speculated and thought they could become big players.
It's never been my strategy.
He never had a dream about the world's power, Burd claims.
I don't think I'm a political precept of this country like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with Time, these stores are too big.

Miscellaneous Scotches
Christmas is approaching, and it is a time when it is appropriate to find out what the celebrities are wearing, and to adapt to it even your celebrated dresser.
The shape of the shirt is very important to highlight the character, which is necessary to be aware of.
Let's make a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagance and a very complicated section.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Energetic company of Endesa, together with the Barcelona councillors, founded 'Officer LIVE'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital of Catalan.
The LIVE' office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will establish and manage a roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure mobility agreements, will manage, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop projectMOVELE, promote electric cars, collect views and results in the sectors involved.
In general, the aim is to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'Electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city involved in the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
It is three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The Andes Energy Company has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support activities in the field of research and technological development in the Catalan autonomous area.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative with the participation of India in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a calm period in the automotive industry.
Government President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the state's main export sector, is waiting for a "peace period".
In the 2009 economic report, Zapatero summarized the measures that had been put in place during the year to support the car sector.
"Without a competition plan for the automotive sector, we would be expected today to leave, to close some of our main manufacturing companies," the president of the government noted.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire for individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, there is a certain period of peace in this industry in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Car Sector Plan (IPA), set out 800 million for projects by 19 producers and 137 subsidiary companies that mobilised an investment of over EUR 3 billion.
The President of the Government explained that this investment is intended to develop new models, to modernise production and current processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government's action on the aid requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which applies in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6%, and has provided a "significant increase" of the records, namely in November of "40%".
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
Madrid will open the first International Hall of Classic Vehicles, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Madrid Casa de Campo Glass Pavilion.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, representing more than 200 foreign and foreign exhibitors.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid products of all kinds related to the engine world.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real coolers for collectors and explorers.
Among the participating companies will be:Clasicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, repair; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and repair of cars; or Cochera Classicos, specialised Mercedes Benz.
Exterior fitness tests
In addition, the commercial activities of this lounge will be complemented by parallel activities: focusing, sporting performances, testing, presentations and competitions.
Quality tests will also be carried out for classic cars and motorcycles in a custom circle outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Maintaining a sports style
The Mazda intends to show that environmental sustainability has no negative impact on the sport style.
And therefore Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system - also baptized as-Stop - which is a device that is currently only available with a petrol engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle performance, population, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent at Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seats, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
With the help of tools and consoles we will conclude that Mazda continues in Japanese trend in the development of futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a significant red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style that Honda Civic also presents.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sharpness of German products and specifically more with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, a large baggage space and regular forms should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and start-up system is currently only available with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower with a six-stage hand transmission.
This engine is a real cooler. It is very soft, with reduced noise, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most requested Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not find so many kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a petrol engine because it is more comfortable when driving and reducing consumption.
As regards equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the system of monitoring of the driving beams (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, control of knowledge and stability, control of speed, internal mirror sensitive to light, deck computer with large screen, parking pins, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheel with 17-inch rail.
And if the equipment is not sufficient, this version has been equipped Pack Premium, for an additional 1,500 euros: adaptable two-axenon and audio BOSE system with CD holder, except for other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in your category.
It shall specify, in particular, the quality of the materials used, their operation and the high level of equipment.
And besides, people who don't find more miles per year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a gasoline engine 2.0 and 150 horses.
The only advantage of this model is its higher price, which makes21,770 euros for the luxury and 23,227 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price Mazda3 offers us a great amount of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Preméra'
L.A. has a red blanket, as soft as Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars shined more brightly than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand 'Nine'. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to view mail, without being able to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when his Time magazine viewed it as one of the products of the year.
Seeing her outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is identified by very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is due, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started to offer two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of the permanent free data services provided, however it is necessary to pay for Peek a six-fold amount.
FonPeek, who was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is a European version of the invention and its third change.
He's as limited as his American opponent, but he brings surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros a month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
Traveling people already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently looking for a café with WiFi (or by connecting the Fon) to check their mail.
The attack with roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a person would need a physics doctorate to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read the miniature letter.
The European Commission is constantly calling for a reduction in roaming tariffs so that they can be accessible to Europe as a whole, which still has no cross-cutting effect.
There is reason for concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon if it does not have WiFi) achieves this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider various offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another good example, offering download of books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device shall be connected and shall be valid upon purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect it to happen once in the FonPeek case, it's about the possibility of buying a permanent approach like Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I'll take a look at my phone mail, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's from the consumer's point of view the best kind.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in the computer.
The color that Michelle loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first US ladies.
For Barack Obama's appearance as President of the United States, she picked her dress and coat in this color, and she also chose the same color when she accompanied her at the second most important moment of her life: handing over the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being of a similar colour - yellow with triple effects - in both cases it was a classy set - dress, bag and coat of the same substance - decorated with a large height or skirt.
At first glance it seemed that the first lady in the United States decided to follow the Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The material from which the clothing is made makes both models quite different.
On the occasion of Michelle’s visit to the office, she used a large handkerchief, in Oslo with a press release.
Changes and supplements: green shoes with a medium-high heel, now similar model, but in gold.
It also wears different parts: this timedream, pre-dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to maternity.
Employment discrimination has increased in recent years, especially among women of younger age who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fruitness and Work Career of Spanish Women' carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Women's Institute.
The study was attended by 9,737 women between 15 and 75 years of age and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited labour market opportunities due to maternity.
The study stresses that at the start of the partnership there are many differences in views on the number of children according to whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside their home, work part-time or have no stable work, start living with their partner before, before having their first child, and generally have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, are lagging behind in partnership and maternity, and have fewer descendants.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years of age from the start of partnering. This figure makes 4.1 in the case of women who have spent most of their life achieving stable employment and therefore had to postpone partnering and child arrival.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on maternity, even though it has a smaller influence on the time of marriage with a partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting women’s age at the time of the marriage of anorexia offspring is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age women marry and have their first child.
Differences are also between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group 35 to 49, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at 25.1 p.m. 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education marry and give birth to the first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or higher education are misappropriating the acquisition of stable employment, before marriage and the birth of the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it, too.
L'Oréal Paris just added a new name to her prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal password 'Because I stand for it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actors at the international level, is thus added to another famous characterL'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, she joined this selected actress's Evangeline Lilly ('lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of Chatter').
The Panic part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by important characters: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelical's partner in the 'lost').
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to talk about in fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, earlier and now – met on the annual price transfer that took place in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen by the best model of the year.
Poker Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicent presents thirty X-rays of writers in 'Ess' poker (Alfaguara, illustration Fernando Vicente) with whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases also in ordinary life).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but it seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The road brings excitement and Vicent does not care about lessons or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading experience, even in repeated reading.
Here are some sights.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book, I have found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, as I feel, but it cannot be called: the benefit of prejudice, the moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nishlist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intelligence, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humour, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been in love with this woman for all of thirteen years, incest, incest, incest, and incest, which is a spiritual principle for reaching heaven by the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssea published in Paris in 1922, Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-digit peaks in the universal literature, which must be overcome from the north side, from which the best horoles will often disappear."
About William Faulkner: "It was a strange man.
He said he was the heir to the county shipyard, or he was the son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the veiled scream of this man from Munich to bring his message to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running ahead of himself and calling to the future and speaking to the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One time she knelt and prayed, 'God my beloved, let me stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "In his grave there were broken out Spencer's verses: 'After an effort there will come a dream,/after a storm a quiet port,/after a war of rest,/after a life of noble death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In his pockets he also brought his depression.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azalls or that the birds were singing the Greeks.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with the neurotics whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pío Baroj: "What else was Martin Santos than to focus on Joyce at Baroj?
What else did Bennett do than let Baroness fix Faulkner's weapon?
What else was the purpose of the cell than to make himself famous for the glory of that man?"
Frequent Aggressions
Last week my 70-year-old mother passed through our fourth, Fuenlabrad period, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 went through the circumference, and our dog, a cross saved from a weight of not more than six kilograms, without a single word added it twice and seriously injured it.
Our frustration is greater than seeing nothing fun in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on the waterfront.
And to that end, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she met these individuals on the walk, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a demon possessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to the woman, the child, the old man, or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, usually in a quiet neighborhood.
Sands have been crying all day.
Of course, we have complained about the nearest Commission, but we doubt that it was about something and that we should not raise any puzzling questions, we find that these cowardly murders were Spanish nations.
Discouragement led us to announce this fact.
We don't understand what's happening to young people today when they're having fun with a defenseless animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We don't understand where the right upbringing is divided, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmets
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial) launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially among young drivers, as both of these entities have reported today.
The aim of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using helmets, as it is the only means by which head injury can be prevented, where appropriate, and die in the event of an accident when driving on a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of their transport safety commitments, which "means more than designing and producing even more secure products", and confirmed that they are trying to fulfil this purpose, in other words by means of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets when driving on a motorcycle, under the name 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when to more than 500 motorcycle repairs will be deployed to get the most widely known public.
In conclusion, Michelin pointed out that the transport safety "is a constant problem" of this company, which is the manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles and whose main purpose is to continuously increase product safety.
Increased sales of light commercial vehicles
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles starts to be remembered.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain accounted for an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to the figures of the parent organisation of Anfac producers and sellers of Ganvam.
However, the positive data is better to put into quarantine because November 2008 is a very bad time for comparison and it was 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the accession of the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: personal car derivatives, pick drinks, supplies, small trucks and light trucks/chargers.
And not even the clouds that hurt demand the most, even though they were purchased by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and in almost 100% of cases it is funding through third parties.
Other factors such as stopping or continuing the bad economic situation should also be added to the limitation resulting from the closure of the bank credit source.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the 2000E purchase aid did not help too much.
In addition to the private individuals, it is necessary to mention the iosobs that operate on the business list of small and medium-sized enterprises which intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 level of not more than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam again reminded that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles and industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The sales association assumes that in 2010 developments will be similar to last year and according to sales estimates in passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary hand brake system is already mandatory.
As in the case of the ABS anti-locking system, this will also be done with the management of the stability of the ESP, the auxiliary hand brake systems, all of which will become compulsory equipment for European vehicles.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others there is a deadline for removing the shortage, which is February 2011.
The aim of the EU's action is to increase the protection of pedestrians, which works in such a way that it can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which will be detected after the driver slips.
But he can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of the Bosch car parts, one third of drivers with an accident did not brake before impact and half of them did not use the full force of the brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires the maximum braking system and reduces the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 fatal accidents per year related to pedestrians could be prevented.
The reduction of this figure will be even more marked-on the basis of calculations would prevent one of four accidents with an impact on persons-after the introduction of so-called intelligent hand brake systems.
In this case, vehicles will be equipped with a system that will catch obstacles and report them to the driver, except for easy braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the impactor cannot be prevented, the device shall act as unintended as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel to January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably on 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the American producer points out that more time will be needed to complete the refurbishment plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will be submitted first to the employees and then to the governments of the countries where the plant is based, will be issued by the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, GM ensures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken in those days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has raised pressure on an American producer to make a certain decision as soon as possible.
GM provides contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to get Volvo, but he is considering the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer Skype, who acts under the protection of the Russian Converg Group.
In the event that it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains valid if its sale fails.
Riding with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this excellent model, the engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, thus showing only 1,275 kg.
On the basis of the first, the automatic landing roof was in paid hand-held operation, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; the aluminium door was further used as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of the air conditioning, 13; the reduction of fuel supply from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to the reduction of the weight by another 7 kg; after the installation of the sports seats of another 12 kg, thanks to the eased 19-palm wheels of five kg.
Finally, the removal of the CDR-30 system means another six kilograms less, and the replacement of the door openings by textile fittings means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a two-axle PDK transmission system, one vehicle with a manually sorted six-degree gearbox was tested, mainly on the second-class roads in California, on the mountain sections with many complex turns.
His behaviour can only be qualified as inaccessible.
Reduced weight does not mean that the vehicle is not printed to asphalt.
On the contrary: we haven't tested a small and light model for a long time, which would, at the same time, pass on such safety when moving in the direction, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete able to warm the muscles during a short drive after the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, and re-use the engine...
Whatever we want, because of the behavior that is as communicative as exact, whatever we point our hands on the wheel, that's what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound according to will
The V6 boxer sound, of 320 horses (over 10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and it is possible to strengthen it with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in Panamanara.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether in sowing or recuperation.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road asphalt that we're going through with Boxster Spyder was pretty ruined, but the car was well able to get out.
Electronic support was almost necessary during the ride; however, in some places we encountered light on the cold and the cold even in the early afternoon.
This ultra-light vehicle is definitely one of the most fun on the market, as it's about something more than just changing Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at €70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Comrade Karl Lagerfelda, Coco Cocoon icon, and the occasional "starlett" on the "company" screens, the singer presents his face of a bad girl as vastly as his Chanel cables.
More than Bad Girl or It Girl, it's Bag Girl.
Basconia awarded her victory in Israel
The workshop won a brilliant victory in 82-91 in its accommodation on the complicated Maccabi Electric field, despite the frequent absences of Duska Ivanovice, and this led her group to the front after the great performance of Mirzy Teletovice, which with eight triple points was the best statement in the company (29 ratings).
Vitorie has been able to replace the significant absence of Hermann, Oleson, Huertase or Micova with a large amount of deployment and collective work, although it has to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the high accuracy of the circle with 16 triangles greatly contributed to the final triumph.
The match began with the blue front, which had been on the mark since the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, indicating that they attacked the Israeli society very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavian Society decided for the internal game of Baraca and the work of Elijah, which was accepted by sanding and slapping on return to its original position to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to act as the best in his 13-point company, although the 'no-six' evaluation of Splitter has already indicated that it will not be the best evening for Brazil.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided even in the least and the Macabeans wanted to remind Vitoria that on their field they didn't win everyone, and 'By Elijah' they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnini have certainly contributed to the return of the "yellow" to the eviction (50-49).
More unappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, the injury, but not dead at all, needed several precise games to breathe, and there appeared Mirza Teletovic, who with three triples almost after him and using Englishe and Ribase returned the score to the calming number (54-67), which reached locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavštís have been smelting the skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow someone to prepare them for the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep company alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter evicted from the faul sevanovic they did not push and defend well, and although the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the game had already won a Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Wounds enable Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost Greece with Olympiacos and left the leader of Group B in Eurolize in a fight marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
Malagasy did not fear the environment of Pavilion's peace and friendship nor the rival, perhaps one of the most sick in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points after themselves, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Rubia, burned the field with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja , although the local arsenal in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minutes 13, which was the moment when the battle between US opponentsBeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek society began to function and demonstrated its superiority in both areas where the absence of an English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal errors of Carlos Jiménez made Unicaja difficult.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Unresolved Response
The third part was very aggressive on the part of Olympiacos, who, despite losing at 19, proved to be dominant and even managed to balance the difference from the battle in Malaga 66-48, a minute 27 that shook the team.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the latest absence of the Scottish beer Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja thanks to the leadership and triple points of Cook and the benefit of Levise left a sure hope n win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos proved to be unstoppable by the reinforcement and overcoming of centimeters in his area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize the envelope 81-62, minutes 37, and Unicaja took the lead in the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the pay that they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, searchers with the largest number of classified ads in the field of reality, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The How much should you take? tool calculates user pay based on more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form that is available on Facebook, where you need to invest professions, years of experience, age and city where the interested person wants to work.
During the week that the application works, the researcher found that the Spanish worker generally " feels badly rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from its researchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst payments.
The British programmer takes 45,226 euros annually and French 31,059, while Spain receives 24,000.
The driver also pays 34,247 euros a year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, Spain has the highest paid job of an artist with 11,592 euros per year; a salesperson with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, half-time employees and social workers.
Brazil sets the date of Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government set a deadline for the suspension of Manuel Zelay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office shall leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his mandate is officially terminated.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras, confirmed for TV Globe that "Mel" knows that to this date he must leave the embassy where he is hiding since 21 September.
"Knowledge is that on January 27 after the end of his term of office, he must leave and seek another place of refuge."
The station also quoted an ex-Stater who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the election on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that it would last until January at the Brazilian Embassy.
However, that same week he tried to get a safe haven in Brazil.
The operation finally collapsed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum that he was trying to save by the "de facto" government, which Roberto Micheletti chaired.
Thank you
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when inflation represented the dominant power in the markets, uncertainty again appeared on the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in the environment where the negotiators make decisions about the future that they do not exist for themselves.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was the debt reduction by direct purchase of assets and indirect release of liquidity in the course of close zero so that financial institutions could purchase assets for disposal.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended, and without questioning their inconsistent liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand into the trench, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we will participate in the return of the risk reduction.
The mobility of the storms and the differences in debt rates have again gained points, although they are still very far away from the abnormal levels reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise private risks, which again affected public debt.
Once again, it is pressing for quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have become the haven of selected investors, thus widening the differentiation of the euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new review of the reduction in the qualification of the Spanish Kingdom.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useful for silencers of moral risk who have once again tried to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy with a view to curbing the harmful consequences of limiting the credit to employment when a new day of thanks should actually be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal struggles between emirate power renewal emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
The government that covers the deficit, the elections and the new government is coming.
He did so in Italy after Berlusconim and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-fulfilment of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro Member State not to fulfil its obligations.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin makes the Greek government transparent and committed its own citizens to shared responsibility when it needs extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are prior to the period of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some surpluses in supported positions would be within the expected range.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the debt of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to be reduced and our expansion continued, this would be a typical Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is just anecdotal. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to take over their recovery scenarios and review their rise scenario for 2011, including OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, the Spanish economy has little hope of experiencing the fulfillment of this warning.
Once again it seems like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "carefully, friend drivers".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán, as the first yesterday, intervened before the subcommittee of the parliamentary chamber, where Spain's energy strategy is being discussed these days over the next two decades.
After his intervention followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasecy, Galán submitted several comments on the proposal submitted by the subcommittee at the closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola Spain, it needs an investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another EUR 60,000 million from this date until 2030, if nuclear power plants are currently in operation.
If not, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola actually believes that in the next decade, investments need to focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the issue has changed and the performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal plants with carbon capture mechanisms, and above all on renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that there is a need for new 18,000 MW, but with other "supported energies".
Galán, who is considered to be a female law on the sustainable economy, which the government has just approved, did not want to leave behind the line that the company requested, as a royal decree to support national coal consumption, which is resisting climate change policy.
In his opinion, "a clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite the "tender" measure, as President Iberdrol called it.
Whatever the case, Galán is of the opinion that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to take place now, because their maturity is ongoing and a stable tax framework is necessary for their initiation.
Ferrovial won 'action' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary Ferrovial for airport services, Swissport Swissport, will play the role of the preferred Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The Agreement, which has not yet expired on economic terms, shall be valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation in the establishment of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association anticipates 20 million investments by 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to explore energy efficiency at airports and airports.
Action seeks its first route in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Actiona is fighting for its first concession on the highway in Australia, which is a market where it is already working as an energy and water business.
The building concerned is a tunnel estimated at $1,700 million in Australian dollars (approximately €1,047 million).
Her opponents are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtif.
The 5km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the eastern coast has become the closest opportunity for Actiona to settle in this country as a construction and concession road company.
Councillor wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP initials) for further development of the project in the commercial plan protected by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the mine.
The tenders are expected to be submitted in May and the expected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (EUR 1,047 million) and, at the final stage, compete three groups with significant presence in European buildings.
A group called Transcity runs Action, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second is one of the largest European underground construction specialists in Italy.
Against the Action Group, the Northern Direct Group is in the game with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group that went through the network is named LBRJV and shares the Australian capital Leighton (subsidiary of the construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), the local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and an important company specialising in the civil construction of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatisation, but it carries with it a clear difficulty to enter otherwise than by acquiring a local construction company.
In addition to the Asian references, the strategies that were guided by the Hochtif or Bilfinger are still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market share of 30 % of its share in Hochtief, owner of the quoted Leighton company.
Million assets
The action shall be based on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector in question, where it already has a significant presence through its activities by the energy supplier and in the auctioning trade.
Among other things, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and manages a group of companies that build and run a rescue facility in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy for access to the construction and operation of infrastructure.
The underground road under the mine, the promoter of which is the Infrastructure Authority of Brisbane, with the name Northern Link (Northern link), is to connect the western motorway from Toowong with the circuit path in Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 km of the tunnel.
The calendar established by the local administration is scheduled for the summer 2010 and the start of the work for December next year.
Although this paid trip would be open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to design in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic mine system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane has already offered this order Hochtief
Australia is still making significant profits, as yesterday it announced a government agreement estimated at 154 million.
The partial ACS shall operate through its Leighton local branch infrastructure the national broadband network with an optical fibre cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the King George Tower construction project on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was just to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In Great Britain, specifically in Manchester, will share with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC was awarded a 64 million-dollar tunnel in Slovenia
Through its branch, the FCC has received an allocation of EUR 64.5 million for the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 km for the Slovenian motorway.
The company received a contract a few days after the work on extending the tunnel in Bosruck, Austria, by 130 million.
In this way, the Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is planned for early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got an ad in Renfe
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the last two years to Ms. Rushmore for approximately three million euros a year, informed the railway company.
The contract contains an extension of 12 months each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected from among the 16 agencies that presented themselves in the competition by Renfe, four of which came to the final, including TBWA, which has been responsible for the creation of advertising in the last three years.
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaign.
Pokutata 63 million proFrance Télécom for the suspension of competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million in France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas that belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator restricted the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes to the consumer at the border of the regulation.
This sanction has been purchased by the former French monopoly and the state company has still purchased more than EUR 560 million of fines since 1994 in order to prevent its competitors.
The fine lodged yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority is considered to have allowed France Télécom to commit a similar offence as in the past and has therefore been re-established.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened up an Internet app store to increase revenues that will not come from voice transfers.
From the start, Orange applications will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries like Spain.
The game in the league champions has brought 476.4 million Madrid and Barce from the beginning
The League of Masters has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have won 476.4 million since that time, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list knows Manchester United.
The list knows Manchester United.
Wining the UEFA Champions League is not only a fame. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided EUR 5,362.5 million between 105 companies (of which 12 Spanish) which participated in this event from the start of the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money he earned for participation, and the only one with AC Milan who won three times the main prize.
The current Catalan champion and the last winner of the World Cup of Europe in 1992 is in the fifth.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two companies that have also counted the most money to participate in the last League of Masters.
And yet she lost both of them with Barç.
On the other hand, Spain is up to the third country, which received the most money through the Champions, although it received the most titles from all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seemingly paradox is explained by the complex procedure of dividing the money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini is expected to make $1,090 million for the Champions League.
UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the preliminary classification round (including Atletice Madrid) has received 2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received 3.8 million only for their presence, with the exception of another 550,000 euros for each match they participate in.
There are also prizes for winning (800,000 euros) and remise (400,000 for each company). Osminalists will receive three million each; eight quarter finalists3,3 million.
Each of the last four will get 4 million.
The champion earns 9 million while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
This is how the club makes a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for victory in the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for which there are 337,8 million.
This money is divided by the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four dedicated seats.
Last year's champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid out according to the number of games played this year.
New Rumasa offers 61m euros for 29.9% Sos
The group of Nueva Rumas yesterday published details of the offer to buy shares with which it wants to obtain a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
This percentage does not involve making a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for a share that would be paid in ten years and would pay interest on this deposit1 % annually.
Yesterday the Sos stock finished trading at 1.85 euros; therefore the offer of New Rumas will value the company by 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumas, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer shall be conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to notify their interest in selling the stock.
CNMV claimed that it had not been informed about the offer, although Ruise Mateoise confirmed that it had joined the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalisation of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the sauce continues to change the structure of its management.
As an attempt to delay possible bids to buy and settle the judicial performance of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesus and Jaime Salazars, Maria Luisa Jordá’s election as head of the internal audit was announced.
This Decision constitutes the first woman who has had a high role in the food business.
This is a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company is still subdued in the legal battle for a alleged move of more than 230 million from the Sos company of the Salazar brothers.
In fact, the possibility that Sos will reveal new transfers of funds in the coming months cannot be discounted
As regards Salazar credit, the former members of the Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) spoke yesterday at the National Court and confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing where they were destined.
CNMV allows the option to exclude the Paternity that participated in Investor Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved the exclusion of the participating Investor Mer against Federica Paternin on 9 October.
The supervisory authority has explained that it approves this operation because it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and is considered to be "sufficient" content explaining the brochures submitted after the amendments adopted on 2 December.
CNMV clarified that the offer was directed at obtaining 550,008 shares of Federica Paternina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were disregarded, which would not be transferred in any way until the tender was closed, which specified that the price was determined by Federice Paternin in accordance with the applicable standards.
New tools for car rating
In these days, storms and accidents not only earn car services.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are withdrawn into a service where the knower has to estimate damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and calculating labour costs and time can be long and complex work.
Calculate manually the repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including works and the workforce can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this kind of system.
Providers of services and solutions for assessing insurance events and maintenance shall collect information provided to them by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audex, from the American Solar Group, is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of tools for assessing and developing sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not at all easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the number of data to be processed continues to grow as more versions, variants and motor solutions have been mentioned in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It is very hot work, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and set its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "run" individual parts of tourist cars.
With regard to the model with massive sales, work can be completed in a week if the process is very fast.
In the case of a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information on are Porsche, but for example not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the rolling stock, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, the Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
National residence is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics) working with three computer screens.
Audex invests 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data will be placed and customers will receive updates every two days.
The processing of this indistinguishable flow of information allows companies to make different use and supply of different products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to individual countries, there are also tools for handling spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide to inform the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
The Audatex isn't offering it in our country, but in the United States it is.
With a view to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain the support that professionals in the sector can use.
This company offers ten different instruments, with AudaPlus as the star product, the standard solution for the assessment of insurance events intended for customers.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the works, it shall also include the time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or by the varnish.
This instrument shall be applicable as applicable for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it only a few times a month.
Then every insurance company carrying out thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audex.
Other products such as AuDAVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the device with which it came from the assembly line only on the basis of the first number of the carriage.
AudaGlass focuses on the glass of vehicles and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows the removal of vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or finding deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to examine how many model brands have gone through the service due to the accident or how many have suffered serious insurance events over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of instrument.
For example, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for the knower and also provides digital images, access to works or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Einsa company founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solution to damage, accidents or car maintenance
Gt Guia rating is her reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 employees and 53 insurance companies.
Turnout has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and in 2008, they accounted for 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the installation office in Paris began.
Audex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solar Group (Audtex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% higher than in 2008.
In our country, the company makes 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solar Group was on the stock exchange of $1,000 million and its shares are now estimated at the total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been quoted on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of vehicle accidents
Last October, the Solar Group bought Autoonline, an Internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation assumed a write-down of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could expand by 15% next year.
The purpose of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to the huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sales service is provided exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance, know-how, loan, services, sale of spare parts and professional sellers who have to register before the start of operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and is running more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 are in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The web currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads, and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, cars whose number of the carriage has been excluded cannot be returned to service, but may be used as a source of spare parts which have not been damaged.
Vehicles with a historical value may be authorised to operate, although they have been excluded, after the preliminary procedure.
Budget of the service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user will only get the budget in four steps: vehicle identification, spare parts search, budget creation.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the certification of senior professionals who are more or less resistant to the use of new techniques of management.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with Internet connection is needed for use.
After identification of the model to be repaired, using the transport number, a real graphical display of the model will appear and then the necessary replacement part will be selected.
The user may include variable as the price of the labour force, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference directory.
The main difference between both systems is that it is service oriented and does not include the estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this workshop tool shall be EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, the company Audex is working to ensure that these views are three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that the mechanics welcome, because it will allow for for example the door to be selected and turned around to show the inside.
