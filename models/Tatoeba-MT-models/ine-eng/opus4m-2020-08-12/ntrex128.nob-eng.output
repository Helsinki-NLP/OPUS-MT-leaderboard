Welsh Members do not wish to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Wallis National Assembly, known today under the Abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not fully satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal follows the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Wallisian Parliament.
Representatives of the entire political spectrum fear that this may lead to ridicule.
A representative of the Labour Party explained his group was concerned because ‘it rhymes on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means 'dustete', and pwp means 'bæsj'.
A representative of the Wales Party, Plaid Cymru, said that the group as a whole was “dissatisfied” and that they had proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Walesian part of the Conservative Party said that his group was ‘open’ for the name change, but noted that the opinion of MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British word for ‘dust’.
In this context, the Wallisian letter W is expressed in a similar way as the letter U is expressed in the English Yorkshire dialect, more than a «uh» sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: ‘It is, of course, the members themselves who have the final right to determine the name to be discussed with.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation which showed general support for the re-enactment of the National Assembly of the Wallisian Parliament.
As regards the title of the representatives, the WMPs were supported by the Welsh Parliament Members, but the MWP option was most supported during the public consultation.
The representatives propose a number of other options, but to bring all parties to an agreement could lead to the head offices of President Elin Jones of Parliament, who will, in accordance with the plan, deliver a legislative draft for the name change over the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for the disqualification of representatives and the design of the Committee system.
Representatives shall have the last right to vote on what they shall be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the elections to determine whether their name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote on whether their name should be changed to ‘Nordic Macedonia’.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a ten-year dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in their territory and, for several reasons, opposes its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is quite simply the price they have to pay for participation in the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silencer – the screams in Harlem wear
“The old ones I spoke to have told me that before the time there was a bar and a church on each corner,” says Adams.
‘Now there are no parts.’
He said that the children's losses were understandable.
“People are socially intertwined in other ways” he now says.
‘Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, which are regularly visited by all.’
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe: ‘And sooner or later they are back at the beginning.’
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the remainder of the neighborhood.
‘Most of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘and therefore will only accelerate the day when these churches must close the doors too well, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.’
Both screams were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main tradesmen – because they refused to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's son-in-law left plans for the reconstruction they bought in a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was "the church bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: «a cultural tax» and «an irreplaceable historical instrument».
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been introduced by the Church's leaders and others by the bishop.
The Council of the Church – the management of the church, consisting of legislators – wrote to the bishop in July of its concern that the bishop came to ‘try to impose costs’ on the council of the church, despite the fact that the council had not been involved in the hiring of the architects or contractors sent by the bishop.
Some sleepy children complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Hai damage 13-year-old on lobster depth in California
A shark attack and damaged a 13-year-old boy when he came after lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had drowned with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy shouted out of amazement at having caught a lobster, but he realized afterwards that the boy shouted 'I was bitten!'
I was bitten!'"
His whole neck was torn up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
'I cried out that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that did the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in the upper torso.
The authorities closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
It is noted that there are more than 135 species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its income on the UK's beauty care market
Sciencebury's challenges Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with merchandise-like jewelry and beauty nurseries, equipped with specially trained staff.
The enlarged shelves are tested in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong entry into the UK's 2.8 million beauty care market, which is still growing while the sales figures for clothing and home items fall.
The investment in beauty care is the result of a supermarket attempt to find a new use area for the site previously used for TVs, microwaves and home items.
Sainsbury's said they should double the number of beauty care products they offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybellline, and Burt's Bees will also be better placed in marked brands, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique brand with mainly vegan products, as demand for this among younger customers is increasing.
In addition, the perfume dealer will test out a sales table in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net trade and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local retail stores means that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's said that the sales will each resemble more and more in a warehouse, taking up the fight against the Aldi and Lidl cheap shops with several services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos' sale in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after purchasing both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's test was a collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated after a riot concerning the distribution of the income from pharmacists in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sales of its 281 shop owners to Celesio, owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skin markers, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Director of Commerce Sainsbury, said: "We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty care halls to create more inviting environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be so ready to provide advice and assistance.
Our brand committee is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting environments and practical locations make us now a beauty care competitor that represents a new business experience.»
Peter Jones is "raving" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones must be furious after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million agreement with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessory brand, True.
Their company was previously compared to Gwynet Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37), who is the program director of this Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last few seconds to focus on their own new gold-related contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “sweet” at a busy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that her new contracts – worth GBP 1.5 million – admitted that she no longer had time for her dress and accessories brand, True.
The company has been compared to Gwynet Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
At the same time as Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was going to leave True, left Jones United Kingdom on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was certainly Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her economic security over the next decades.
Everyone's totally shocked that she's chosen to go.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was right before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the main quarter of Marlow which is now ready for sale.»
Experts believe that this morning program leader, who is among the most popular stars in the UK, can cost the company several million pounds due to major investment in products such as pouts and light, mote and coseclars, as well as a potential delay in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
My mother-in-law Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby established True with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became the chairman of the board in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host to the I'm A Celebrity I'm.
A source standing near Jones said yesterday «We will not comment on his business business».
Check facts «and then we fell in love»
He knew that the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment would be regarded by some as 'little president' and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
said Trump in his imitation of a news tanker.
‘I haven’t given anything away.’
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after having himself declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big mess on the way to nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen a ‘corresponding response’ from the US on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States instead still has sanctions designed to keep the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a assembly of his electors.
"We do very well with North Korea," he said.
«We were going to war against North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve Kim's relationship have produced positive results, such as putting a stop to rockets, helping to get hostages released and getting the lives after American officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this step-by-step arena, we would have around 200 people standing right here," said Trump and pointed to the area right in front of us.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia are tearing down an island and taking the lives of hundreds of people
In the cold water of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organisations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of the inhabitants of Lomboks had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for the submission of international aid.
‘In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is quite challenging,’ Sumbung explained.
Save the children are now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure if foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the national crisis management state, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Given the constant exposure of the earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is terribly poorly prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Light to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning signal at Palu, although a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death figures.
Even in the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombo to deal with earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the destination of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has upgraded Indonesia's paramilitary infrastructure to a major point in his campaign, and has spent a lot of money on road and rail.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for Yoko's administration, which will be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from continued sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have changed to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslims repeated locks in the streets with machetes, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge with late balance in the fight against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting in 89 minutes at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a fit from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while making his 1-0 back.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it to the longest corner.
The test was high above the box, and the ball fell to the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
'I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players that Shaq always send the ball in the future as well as it can do, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,' said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
«I saw Kante come and touch the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kick it further.»
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a target for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a fit with the tail back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the center of the track and sprinted into the Liverpool part of the track.
Kovacic came with a quick delivery on the main track.
He then fed out of a fine breakthrough that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the team game of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League in football for men in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The death figures from the tsunami in Indonesia reach 832
The number of deaths following Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, reported the country’s state of emergency on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, explained Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from repaired buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman gets stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was assaulted, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: "We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I will ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and then heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask all, in particular the driver, who may have caught something on his car camera, to contact – they may have information essential to our investigation.’
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was a permanent resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway, and the police have said that they are working to inform the victim.
A drone hunter living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been informed that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was aimless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated when he told a man that the whole area was now being treated as a place.
A crying woman appeared on the scene.
She repeats "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14 p.m. two police cars behind the fence, while a third car was standing outside.
A number of police officers were outside the barrier and had oversight of the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, referring to ‘log 247’ from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial to be included in the "rewrite history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of the cultural and religious treasures of England that were carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the history team Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's edition as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also became a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his father Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic production of Cromwell is a proof of the 1800's opinion and is part of the history of a man many still deserve to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell becomes by many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than it is today, given how Parliament defends against outside pressure – of course in his time it was about the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has formed the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of that conflict.
His performance as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.»
Drapsgris takes the life of Chinese peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only after the name ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered by blood from a broken pulse wound near a belt on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to place vaccines on pigs on a farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He had traveled with his fat from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after the fat found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig road was open.
He said that inside the pighouse there was a big hole with blood on his mouth.
A medical examination confirmed, according to the report, that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
«The bones of my fat were bloody and maltreated» explained the fat, referred to by the last name Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from the surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his fat.
While the police are collecting evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and market management are negotiating some kind of compensation for the death.
Although the dispute is happening, it is not the first time that a pig has attacked people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pressed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer's wife was able to hunt the animal out.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to the CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to the common, but that the taste of blood can have a trigger effect.
‘Only from the heart.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're trying not to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.»
The remnants of the Rosa hurricane will lead to heavy rain in Southwest USA
As reported, the hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa will, however, take the rainstorm on her journey through North Mexico and South-West America in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind strength of 135 km/h and was an hurricane of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a tug begins to form across the Pacific and moves east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start to push tropical humidity north towards Southwest USA.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Thereafter, the cooperation between tropical humidity and the tide approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the south-west in the following days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous rivers, liquid rust and rapid and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Dyptropic humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the South West, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are possibilities for rivers with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert to foot as long as there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can lead to estuaries becoming vastly smelting rivers, and the storm will lead to local windfalls that can contain dust and sand.
The approaching tide will lead to local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along South California.
Total rainfalls of more than 1.3 cm are possible and this can lead to fluid rushes and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the area of rainy weather.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain will spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner countries on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropicals remain very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of strong temperature differences across the central US on Sunday.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next couple of days, permanent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern US will probably get a warm start in October, with degrees high on the twentieth from the Southern Plains to parts of the North-East US.
New York City can now reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate message indicates that the eastern US is most likely to have temperatures higher than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six television networks, saw Thursday's arresting testimony from the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that was due to take place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political campaign continued, and broadcasters interrupted their usual broadcasts to announce Friday's great surprise in the last few seconds, when it came to the conclusion that the senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's court panel that she was 100 percent sure that a married Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take her clothes off at a youth school festival.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seer numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, the Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To give a little perspective, this number is equivalent to the final game of the American Football Championship or the Oscar Distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose spokespersons have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led one of the networks, with an average attendance of 5.69 million for the whole day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main person for Friday's drama.
On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting of the court committee while protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stood down looking for several minutes while he was separated, while the event was sent directly to CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he will tell our country the truth?”
He was told that "you have the power when so many women are powerless".
Flake pointed out that his office had come with an opinion, and said that the doors closed that he had come to have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, as the court committee would vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be continued to the whole Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said he was willing to do this only if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of political games around Brexit
In an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to play "political games" with the future of Britain and undermine the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, pressted side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called 'Checkers' plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was 'very ridiculous'.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police attack Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the LSU's death
Police have attacked a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Diteon Simpson (20) is arrested and targeted for intentional murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the basketball game.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS partner WAFB.
After hearing Simpson, the police said he confessed to having shot and killed Wayde.
His bail is set to USD 350 000, according to The Advocate.
The lawyer in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, stating the cause of death as a wound in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for its working group on the acquisition of refugees, the State Police Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population for their contribution to the investigation leading to an attack.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanks to the police force of the area for his "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "knush" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"That's what we're afraid of at all times," Wade said.
Volcano spraying ashes over Mexico City
The ashes spraying out of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southernmost neighbours in Mexico’s capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevention de Disasters, Mexico’s public state of crisis prevention, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity went into the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded during one day.
The Eater monitored several cases of bullying and shaking.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ashes that covered windscreens on cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conjunction with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors for independence had a clash with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote by Catalonia on bailout.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the riot police and bombed them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handcuffs also broke out later on the day, when the police used batons to limit the fights.
For several hours, independent demonstrators stood and called «Never forget, never forgive», face to face with Unionist demonstrators called «Long live Spain».
Fourteen people were treated for minor damage they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the 1 October referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but the fair of separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming excess of redundancy, but it was poorly met because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the release.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured in violent confrontations yesterday, after the police tried to stop the vote held at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups lie in the streets on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, however, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
"Yesterday we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy of getting a vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems keeping the pressure up this year, after many of their well-known leaders have travelled in self-imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting legal proceedings for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was filled by politicians on both sides.
‘The situation is becoming more and more tense,’ he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison waiting for a case late in the fourth year, announced that he will be held in the European Parliament next year.
“To stand up for elections as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the oppression and retreat from democratic values we have seen by the Spanish government”, he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after driving a car several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30 p.m.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A brush may also have been fired against the car at a time.
Menga's attack leads to Livingstone's 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured winner
Livinston was amazed at Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good match from Dolly Menga proved to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to the hibernian in second place.
The Gerrards side has still not won the off-road in the Premier League this season and will play against the Hearts leaders, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home combat against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, has remained neutral through six fights in the division. Chief Coach Holt has not yet lost a fight after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for its smooth guests
Holt's law was supposed to have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but the bomb on the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kicked forward after entering to meet Craig Halkett's head over the target.
The company lot Rangers played in front of themselves, well aware that they could make trouble for their guests at death.
And that's how the crucial goal came to be.
Rangers gave himself a free park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Rangers had had seen the ball a lot all the time, but the domestic defense had turned out to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos performed a nearly saving score by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of the Rangers Keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston Death Ball in a short-term fit.
Crosswords still entered the Livingston Box and were still saved, while two sentences – once after Halkett's protest against the replacement Glenn Middleton, and once for hands – were translated.
Livingston Phenomenal – Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alaskar Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all fantastic together, and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style of the game and the humanity have changed little since they came to the top again, but Holt must have much of the honor of the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on a tack lift throughout the fight.
Rangers, on the other hand, didn't have my inspiration to sign with.
Although they have sometimes been very good under Gerard, they were unable to live up to this standard.
The last part of the fight was labs – they only entered the home part once – and it was a bit of a rise for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
There has been a division of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police stated security as the reason that a population of 25 000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters met in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan – many of them Kurdish – were also heard from themselves, and criticised Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is hailed as a whole by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collision: Cyclist killed in collision with a car
A cyclist is killed in a collision like a passenger car in London.
The collision took place in the crossing between Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a travel trip to Deptford south-east of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a driveway where the driver escaped from the town of Children Street, about a mile from the Saturday collision.
The Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and alert the affected.
Roadblocks and bus rides are in place and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in insurgents
Six prison officials have been injured in an incident in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Drives broken out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and is still running.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ officers have been collected to handle the event, involving eight employees and limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial damage on the site.
A person in charge of the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may spend even more time behind lockdown and beating.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 employees, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October yesterday, the riot police were summoned to handle a serious incident where the employees were attacked with billiards.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with river (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It is the cause of Arizona being hit by a tropical low pressure, but it is likely to happen early next week, as the remaining power of the hurricane of Rosa moves through the desert areas of the southwest and leads to flood hazards.
National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the weather will start late Monday evening.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only "Ti tropical cyclones have maintained their status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.’
The latest National Hurricane Center models provide 5–10 cm precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongolon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin mountain range, are likely to reach between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are beyond risk, Rosa may be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although the flood is a serious problem, some of this precipitation will probably be beneficial, since the southwest US is currently in a drought.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, a little over 40 per cent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, which is the next highest category”, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane hits the country of Rosa at the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has power on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind power of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific, and thus loses power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storms on Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and can lead to great fluctuations.
‘Total rainfall of 7,5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonora, with a potential for up to 25 cm precipitation’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the boundary of Arizona gruesome Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
‘The main danger expected by Rosa or its remains is very severe rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert in the USA’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening rivers and liquid Rusks and Rapids in the desert and Earthquakes in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four assaults for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were attacked, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found the knife in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04.00 BST on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were attacked during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who can have mobile recording of the event to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has been "a member of the minority and mind" of the Democratic Party.
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the thoughtless and shocking tactic of the democratic party,’ Trump said in front of a popular meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been "members of the minority and mind" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress on Thursday, and rejected the strong and emotional charges from Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault against her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifies to his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant, powerful and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most capable lawyers of our time, with a flat-rate public service vantage point’, he told a meeting of his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred discretion to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of the fact that the Republicans are voting in the middle of the elections.
«We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
‘That is why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.’
Trump claimed that the democrats have the goal of ‘resisting and preventing’.
The Senate's first mid-term vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant of a leader within the Republican Party to the CNN.
Several hundred deaths of Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, the numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were drawn into the sea by huge waves that huddled against the beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, then up to six meters high waves drenched in land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way and dragged many out into the drowning death.
Tsunami came in the heels on an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
‘When the tsunami arose yesterday, people still drove with activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s State of Crisis Management (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
‘Tsunami was not alone — it drove cars, trunks and houses, it hit everything on the ground,’ Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climb up into trees to escape from the tsunami and survive.»
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos published by the crisis management system showed many damaged buildings and shops, distorted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be identified by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's state of assessment and use of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the force from the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times more than the force of the atomic bomb released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the state.
Nugroho described the damage as «comprehensive» and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and injuries could be the coast of the larger country 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication ‘was completely corroded, completely without information’ from Dongaga, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.’
On Saturday, the state was strongly criticized for not being informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man in the upper floor of a building shouts desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching the passerby on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water will come sinking toward the beach, tearing down buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuations are still desperate for food and other needs.
The city's airport is open only for relief work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The numbers of deaths after the tsunami in Indonesia are higher than 800.
That's awful.
World Visions personnel from Donganga have arrived safely at the Palu Centre, where they have sought light under the broadcast count at the farm in front of their office, but the past major destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses,” he said.
That's awful.
As relief organisations began the dark preparations for emergency assistance, some complained that foreign relief workers with much expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, foreign money, supplies and workers cannot be released into a crisis zone until it has been declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘When the government says 'Greit, this is a national disaster', we can open the borders for international aid, but the situation has not yet received any status.’
As the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing will hope to be among the miraculous stories that shed light on the dark news picture of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was fished out by a bell.
On Sunday, a woman was freed from rescue teams after spending two days trapped under the ruins of her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the national paragliding team, had thirty-two of the missing paragliders for Asian medicine, which was carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those who were caught in the ruins of Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I should carry my own emotional,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the practitioners who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to gray crochet marks, rather than a few blue crochet marks.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal USD 26 750 under a minibank charge in Newport on the Livee
On Friday morning, he stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a minibank in Newport on the Lifee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and was ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy there was another man who "run behind the Brink's employee" and stole a purse to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspicious rumors from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
All who have information about their identity must contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creation was previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of its eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancelled on an "emotional basis", according to the serialist.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has previously cooperated with West, has also varied between the use of brackets and letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use military against civilians
Mexico's Acting President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Military troops fought against a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968 and executed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education bring young people into criminal proceedings.
The United States should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they use for research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and performer of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have issued announcements about artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, introduced a plan yesterday and aims to be number 1 for innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough," Lee said.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next great performance of artificial intelligence comes from the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book «AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order» was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that hit the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee recognized the previous technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation's smart heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive state funding, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that steals academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have a degree of doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive offers of residence permit automatically," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation is funding people from academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations are distributing money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academies, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they currently invest more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the US legislation aimed at establishing a national safety commission for artificial intelligence has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote in the vote on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to the ‘Nordic Republic of Macedonia’ in order to resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which has blocked their efforts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour is a requirement in Greek territory and has put down the veto to include them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycotting campaign has raised doubts as to whether the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 per cent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership in the approval of the agreement with Greece?’
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the country's future, for the youth in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be crucial because a large number of Members have said they will respect the outcome of the vote.
The amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The country’s electoral commission has stated that they had not received any irregularity reports by 13 a.m.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018. The Macedonian referendum is about to change the country's name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small scene and drew chairs in front of the tents set up by those to boycott the vote.
"We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we will be logged in with our heads raised, not to get out of the way," says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they won't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
State Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to vulnerable investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think most of them will be for, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He says that a 'yes' response will be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 per cent of eligible participants in the referendum – this is lower than the required meeting.
Another study, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 per cent of the respondents have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they came to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the meeting must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle the pro-western government has supported since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero manipulates the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in Manchester City 2–0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a target for 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a fit at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran for a fight with three Brighton defenders before he got out on an open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four greens.
He came around one defender before he ran from more on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a fit to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right-hand side of the net.
“Aguero still wears off with some foot problems,” the City Manager told the press.
«We talked about he came to play 55–60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal just then.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League fight.
This goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball into Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful passageway across the left flank to Larry Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the death line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League team game at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be the spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to place a strong bet.
However, the equally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the path on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado League, which leads over Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in the Netherlands West.
Rockies got a wild card place with a 5-2 win over National's Friday night, but is still out after securing his first division title.
Although we don't have anything to win, at least we can play with the knowledge that the vote here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of battle I get to play this year.
Why would I not participate in it?"
The Nationals have still not announced its launch pitcher for Sunday, but will be willing to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting picker for 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and would throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-hand Washington player has won 18 matches this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The President referred discretion to the situation around the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh while discussing how important it is for the Republicans to vote in the interim elections.
«All we have done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant.
Trump continued «You see this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back at any price.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, aim to "resist and prevent".
“And you see it in the last four days,” he said, and called the democrats “sense and bad and pure and dishonest”.
He referred to the Senate Court Committee and referred to the democratic Senator Diana Feinstein by name, on which the audience was raised.
«Do you remember her answer?
Have you played the document?
Um, um, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say what they say.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
I am despite all the latest in a number of Labour Members who have been informed that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I should be censored because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of having responsible economic policies, national security, Europe – ironically similar things that the former leaders disagree with.
At the presentation of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it said that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the vote at many of the meetings, and the promise of 'softer, more friendly' policies is too long forgotten if it actually started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy was led, when colleagues earlier thought that I shared many political positions, suddenly starting to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for the opinions I had never previously agreed on, whether they were on the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly – and it has nothing to say – I receive a lot of bad messages on social media that require me to be dismissed, condemns central policy and tells me that I should not be in Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that discriminates against sex and racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross separation has been normalised.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Workers' Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to all, and every mistrust proposal and every change in the electoral rules will make the party narrower.
I have received many advice during the last two years in which I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much because it will “do everything better”.
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the failure of the Thatcher government that had led to my classroom in the public school I went on was literally infallible, I have struggled for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and minister of government.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can have in any way misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current management.
To those who presented the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that since our country is racing towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and strengthen my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of resignation or political incompetence will prevent me from doing what I think best to protect their interests.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unavoidably Airs Up to Tops
Two late attempts have changed the final result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastic entertaining Tenent's Premiership campaign.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only unconquerable of the ten.
In the end it was as much their superior defense as their ability to use the opportunities they had given to the home that led to the departure of the winner, and the coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
“We have been challenged in our fights so far and still unobsessed, so I must be pleased with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “All honor to Ayr, they were better able to use the possibilities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's trial in 14 minutes, with target park from Frazier Climo gave Air management, but a yellow card to Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, lot Melrose balance position, and Jason Baggot performed an effort without target park.
Climo reinforced Ayre's management with a penalty park before he, right before the break, scored and target parked a solo attempt to change his position to 17-5 at break.
But Melrose began the second half hard, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This led to a longer stay in connection with a serious damage to Ruarid Knott, which was carried out on the carrier, and from the restart Ayr increased management even more oathed an attempt by Stafford McDowell, with a target park from Climo.
Air's working captain, Blain Macpherson, then got yellow card and Melrose took advantage of it to have an extra man on the track to the fullest with a trial from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home page came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have covered the Climo when he did not have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the entry behind the highlights of the Ayr-moule.
Climo performed a target park, as he did again almost entirely from the start, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's boxing park and sent flanges Gregor Henry dismissed for the fifth attempt of the site.
Quiet Game star ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on its way into the service industry – it was recently discovered that he was appointed Director of a restaurant company with a gift.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, for which he writes his hands and plays together with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemfill.
Duen has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to official entries, he is the Director of the Agriturismo Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's «living restaurant industry».
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a land without a coastline, hopes that justice will open the way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol a riggin-covered marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public construction raises a blue flag.
Marine bases from the Titicacas Sea to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
The whole country of Bolivia has still been fresh in memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict of the 1800s, and the country lengthens once again to sail on the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for several decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
‘Bolivia has power, a Community spirit and peace of mind, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive attitude,’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the knowledge of the International Court of Justice on large screens in many different places in the country, hoping that the Court of The Hague will give its notice in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after several decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own seabed.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president – who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also put a lot of emphasis on Monday's knowledge.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia's party, and that it would change very little if it had.
The United Nations body, as the rest of the Netherlands, has no authority to let them leave Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
The knowledge of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the last arguments were heard that the case ‘was not complicated’, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have actually done worse things.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration’, Zárate said.
She believes that Morale's antagonistic rhetoric has spared away any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations on one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's ruling was unusually rapid.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will give ‘an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new generation of relations with Chile’ and the possibility to ‘put a stop to 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties’.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – which is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – has used the maritime situation as a political shelling shelter.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific’, he added.
‘Knowledge is a reason to see what we must do to overcome the past.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never weaken its nuclear weapons if they cannot rely on US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with their pledges during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments will, at the same time as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to launch the established nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a ‘wanted dream’ that continued sanctions and American resistance to the declaration ending the Korean war will sometimes force North Korea to kneel.
The US authorities are sceptical to accept the declaration without first launching significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, president of the United States, want to have another meeting.
But there is a lot of doubt about whether Pyongyang really has plans to let go of an arsenal in the country probably looks like the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo has plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Motive shows in Paris reveal the last in huge headgear, which is on its way to a dress shop near you
If you want some big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't need to search anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne emerged a selection of rare, oversized headplugs as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel exercises on Moteuka in Paris.
Very unpractice haters have been popular at Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent the eye-catching creations down their catwalk.
Valentine's most eye-catching plague was an exaggerated bee had painted with a spring-like wide brake as the heads of the models were drowned.
Other oversized accessories included spicy watermelons, a magic hat or even an pineapple, but they are not made to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also emerged a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had repeated lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation remembered about diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in the cake.
And if you're out after even bigger fashion accessories, then you're lucky.
Stylish experts predict that the huge hats may be on the way to a broom shop near you.
The oversized hats come straight in the heels of La Bomba, the straight hat with a half-metre-wide brake that has been seen on all and everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very unpractice hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in the street that is almost as big as the bathroom model that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, which is bordered by raffia frenzy and supplemented by a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Moteuka in Paris.
Kendistylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the dress shops next summer – when the designer has had such an impact it will be difficult to ignore the demand for excessive accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland's fresh schools are still showing academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with excellent results for a year, supported by individual and joint success in sport, art, music and other social activities.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free School Council), have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, and work hard to deliver the best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made school pen, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, when the words of his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words of his heart shall reach."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot only stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the year's exam, we see that language is at the top of the table with the highest rates of survival from fresh schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the examination character A.
The data, obtained from 74 member schools of the Free School Council, showed that 72 per cent of students received the exam character A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill for children and young people will inevitably need in the future.
Language as a professional choice is now valued at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the science of fresh schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for reasons of job vacancy, 17 per cent of employers could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for a future career.
As many and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned another language, these lifelong skills will give real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
To communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a boost to competition.
According to a YouTube survey by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and in French the only language was a two-digit number (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
Learning more languages, in particular those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered most valuable to the United Kingdom on the road towards 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a selection of languages to choose between in free schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish free schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, whatever the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that language is still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as ‘international communication capacity’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the Sunday's pre-season opening fight against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
The number of minutes he has to play is still not determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game pre-season plan.
'I don't need a driver's camp at this stage of my career,' he replied.
Time for the Trump People's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
The president is launching a number of election meetings tonight. Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned popular meetings in the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote of approval for his elected highest-ranking candidate is pending, Trump aims to obtain support for the forthcoming elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when the voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia People's Meeting tonight, and how can it be viewed online?
Trump's People's Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia on the network below via direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss weekly hearings for the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh, who is charged with sexual assault. A expected confirmation vote has been held for up to one week while the FBI investigates the case.
The main objective of all these meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that in the next few weeks, these five popular meetings aim to "enlist volunteers and support players as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
“Congression control is as crucial to his agenda as the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are moving towards a campaign season”, Reuters heard from a campaign speaker for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening's crowd meeting, which is scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh Press, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican latent date, Patrick Morrisey, who's on the line.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a promise of the measurements,” said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows spirit to maintain faith as they enter the Sunday single-game
After three one-sided sessions Saturday afternoon fursomes may have been exactly what Ryder Cup of the year needed.
The moment's twisting pendulum is a fully-discovered concept of sport, yet some players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the moment is now?
"They lead by six points and now there are four, so we will carry it with us as a moment," said Jordan Spieth when he left the course for the day.
Europe will, of course, have the advantage – they run with four points and it's 12 to play for.
But as Spieth says the Americans feel they have got some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and leads for example.
The deep celebration screams were raised as his round continued, and fell down to a decisive setting to lift the match to undecided when he and Thomas lay two below after two.
His putting, which won them the 15th match, was met with a similar scream – by the black who shows that he still doesn't think the American team is hopeless.
"We really just have to put all the knuts on and focus on our own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have got more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is certainly Ryder Cups' great success story.
Europe's unusual but glorious couples have four of them and do not put a foot wrong.
«Moliwood» was the only couple who escaped a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to move both to and from the living population make it clear that they are the biggest competitors on Sunday, and there are no other players in the public will either see to secure a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Either way, at the same time, in each hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson got up easy with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of the morning when he was partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles in the course of the first nine holes lay the Spanish and the Swedish so far on demand that they had no chance of taking back the advance.
But on Sunday, there's no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at in close terms because of the collaboration between the couples, the advice they give to each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn for a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session has also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit of individuals, especially in the USA, have missed.
Europe leads 10-6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong leap at the start of Ryder Cups last day, after completing Sunday's fourball and foursomes games with 10-6 leadership towards the US.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, who fought to maintain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's fourballs and won the 3–1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't get back any of the advances.
Jim Furyk's page has to get eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoker to have got four points in line, and he and Molinari – who together got the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have got four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cups history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into fourball, they collaborated seamlessly to beat down Woods and the American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with even more repulsive 5&4.
Woods, who stayed through two matches on Saturday, glittered to the heart, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in rows.
Justin Rose, resting at the fourballs of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2–1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is ranked number one and three on a world basis.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this hot day with light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won the major three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a tough 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team clearly come in after a four-point advance at the start of the single game, but as current owners only need Fury's side to get undecided to keep the trophy.
But having been the next best for two days, it doesn't look like they'll be able to deliver an attack on Saturday.
North Korea will "no way" join unilaterally untrustworthy
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened the mistrust of the United States and that the country would in no way unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation’s annual general meeting that North Korea has implemented ‘significant welfare measures’ during the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, disassembling the nuclear test area and by promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We haven’t seen any similar response from the USA, however,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not, under any circumstances, unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a United States President and a North Korean leader, where Kim was promised to work against "the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has requested a formal end of the Korean war that took place from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for a reduction of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
‘The United States insists on ‘attaining nuclear weapons first’ and raises the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes ‘the declaration of the end of the war’’, according to Ri.
«The belief that sanctions can force us in our knees is a wish dream for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further misappropriation.’
Ri did not mention the plans for a second match between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party to this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of Korea would not have been as determined as it is.’
However, the tone of Ris' speech was very different from that of the four-year-old, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the US with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Onde President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood up this year in front of the United Nations and urged Kim to be courageous enough to take the steps of disarmament, but said that much work still remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is nuclear.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, and said that “It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months”.
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and missile weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then he said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last tour did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had made progress, but only hours after the charge of North Korea to have brought him with "walking demands".
North Korea committed itself at a meeting with Moon this month to decommissioning a missile area and a nuclear weaponry whose United States took “corresponding measures”.
He said Kim had said that these "corresponding measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise Washington's relationship.
Harvard students take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students to get more sleep by addressing the growing uncultivation of puking through the night with coffee drinks as fuel.
One academic found that students at the best university in the world often had no clue how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the effect sleep deprivation has on learning.
“After the talk a girl came to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to the students how important it is with good sleep habits to perform academically and sportingly, and to the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw the students suffer from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a bedroom where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
«We are aware that this will not change the conduct of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, in the same way that you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to puke all night, he said, and added that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to an increasing problem of sleeplessness.
Good sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleeplessness puts the brain in hunger mode, which leads to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course. He took one of the classes of the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up an alarm when they were to behave as well as when they were to stand up and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED light.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Target of Menga turns out Gerard's men
Ranger's lead was another escape when Dolly Menga's goal hit Steven Gerard's score 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to win its first victory since February 4–1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss to 18 matches as manager and successor since his eight points from Ladbroke's Premiership Leaders Hearts.
The amount hit to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to balance.
Rangers are now falling in sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on target differences.
It may be more disturbing in yeast for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for head damage after an object was thrown from the public.
Gerrard did eight shifts on the team, like he walked past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been glad to see how his armored team beat the opponents.
Rangers might have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes in the match when Menga's first fit sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player lost the chance.
A long frenzy of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target pole.
Rangers took control, but it looked as if their game was more of a hope than a belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have a penal park after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson denied this.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first place, but former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly didn't get any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and an empty kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game's turn, no one can deny that they deserve it for the effort.
Again Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player gave immediate results when the fishing player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the players away to play exactly the kind of fight they like, while Lithgow and Halkett caught up a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the leadership in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacob's before Lithgow's head from the corner.
Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton had a rather late demand for a penal park while he was at the port in conflict with Jacobs, but again he saw Thomson away.
Almanac: The Founding of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a detection that led to the apparatus we know today as the geiger counter.
The geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and has also become part of the popular culture through the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you take these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.»
Evans: "I'm going to make it sound now!"
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old day.
But the invention he gave his name, lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them into a laboratory
Cells can now ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancer forms and then injected into the patient again
A vaccine under examination has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered from had passed out for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then inject these cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 «drives growth of different types of cancer», including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure in which immune cells were taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.

Kanye West was bent in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a famous performance where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to vote in 2020.
After having performed his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, brought a Make America Great Again hat, he extended out against the democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee of the charges of sexual assault presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, it was uploaded by the West in social media by comics Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to mock West by putting out the recording.
The West also complained to the public that he had heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headaches.
"The mob beat me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They're fucking with me!
And then they said that I don't understand what the reality is," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want me to see what the reality is?" he said, and he said that he would "take on me the Superman cap, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Try love.
His comments were bent at least twice, and the employees who worked on SNL so faintly reported Variety, where a staff member said: “The whole studio was killed.”
West was brought in as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he introduced the song «I Love It» dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West was supported by the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: «To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR MASSENE IMOT.»
But talkshower Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "who he is and it's absolutely amazing".
«But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his «art») as I believe he is cultivating and excavating ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was "the stranger formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rappercollege Snoop Dog has had the name Snoop Lion. Then it is of course the dead musical Prince, who changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
The purpose of the killing tests after stabbing at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been targeted for attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
Targets are expected to be produced for Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The purpose will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington is long out against "gift masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the swordfighter Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticised the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles in movies often make young men think they have to be brave to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something had gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who had recently married Game of Thrones-College Rose Leslie, also 31 years, agreed that he was very busy with the theme.
“I am very concerned about this – where did it go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that TV can have parts of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" because of the strong masculine roles.
He continued: "What is born, and what is taught?
What is broadcast on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate this very side by being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions in our time – how can we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any successors or successors of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is “completed with battlefields and horses”.
From November, Kit will play the main role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a rancher.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recording, so that something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy-priced fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been hit in the country, says a health representative.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfers.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health personnel said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Due to its conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men after each marriage to women.
Many of the infections are due to insufficient protection of sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the involvement of leaked data on Republican senators, of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Members of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, refused Saturday to charge that members of her staff had posted the personal data to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawyers.
The Democrat from Los Angeles insured by the claims was made by ‘ultraconservative’ commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information was reportedly included the addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the charges of assault against the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had called out Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to the Waters' office and disclosed information about a member of the Waters' staff, according to Hill.
‘This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and a regular lie’, Waters continued.
«The members of my staff - who have been compromised by their identities, personal data and security as a result of these illegal and false charges - had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and a regular lie.’
Waters' opinion was quickly criticised on the web, among others by former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
‘This blessing is aggressive,’ Fleischer wrote.
‘This indicates that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They don't have to defend themselves.
They must not question the accused's motives.
They must act calmly and understand.»
Fleshly compared Waters' reaction to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the middle elections, also has his thoughts on Twitter.
“Stort – if it’s true”, he tweeted.
In his opinion, Waters said that her office had warned her of “relevant authorities and the police regarding these false charges”.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed’ she continued ‘and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff’.
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again – bloodthirsty Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit events in all new films with a British shrapnel and it seems to be relevant for this resumption of the parody francish Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will Sarcastic self-esteem how hopelessly we are becoming the nation's new export products?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with its eyelids and the rubber face has been renewed its license to rotate it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended in territories with non-English film audiences.
He is, of course, the disgusting secret agent who despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions is a mix of Clouseau, a boy Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one single note in the musical entry with the fire car theme during the opening ceremony at the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the longest forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man leaving chaos everywhere.
It's one and the other great moment in the last Johnny English fart.
I loved how Johnny English approached a middle-aged helicopter and the rotor leaves cut his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes right, but the humor feels quite bloody and strangely excessive, especially now that the “serious” brand items such as 007 and Mission Epip willingly have comedy entries.
The humour seems to be more directed towards children than adults, and for me Johnny English's fads are not as inventive and ate as the silent film islands of Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret web of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the perjury of the guard agent – a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop of a state minister, a pumped and turned figure who is already undergoing a complete crisis of political populality: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this as well-Teresa-May role, but the manual does not give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since each active spy has been discovered, she has to pick up some of the retired.
And that means the cloned Johnny English, who is now teaching at a snobbish institution, but gives informal instruction in secret.
English is taken back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, nauseous helper, Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, apart from a sub-commander, a hysterical superclass devil where Vicki Pepperdine is a little thrown away.
So Batman and the Robin style of rotating everything to the mission of the queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's fantastic woman fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the minister of state is being led by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the British cyber problems: the luscious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with lively sidewalks: dressed as servants they put the guys on a luxurious French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to become known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so loving and noisy it is, so it's a lot to remember about children's TV with all the stuff.
Pretty medium-sized, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies that they are planning to let the British work four days a week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day work week – but be paid for five.
The party will obviously use savings from the revolution by providing workers with an extra day of the week.
This will result in a three-day sale of employees, while they receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits the Party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to four-day weeks so that workers can also benefit from the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but the four-day smoke is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to make the pendant turn for the benefit of the workers, in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.’
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four days in the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the tank is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day week is not the party's policy, and is not something that is being assessed by the party."
Financial Speaker for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power of ‘faceless directors’ and ‘profiters’ from public service providers.
The scheme of the shadow Chancellor also means that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not returning the full shareholding because a Labour Government can make ‘deductions’ from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the company boards and set up employee funds to transfer 10 % of equity to private-sector companies to the employees, who could receive an annual dividend of £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI review of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind
The FBI's review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put a final vote on his nomination to the highest level with at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's finding could bring some Republican senators to a standstill.
In an interview that was sent Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
«I said at the opening of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, fragile, unmistakable.»
However, Graham's voice seems to have been buried in stone.
“I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it must be an insightful find,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett rejected it energetically," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘And none of them could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday is New York's host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to act and an equally impressive mission; eradicate the world's poverty.
Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will have thousands of people streaming to the large plain of Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real objective of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or «actions», such as volunteer work, send an e-mail to a world leader, take a phone or other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it's only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for changes, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" - that people feel they are making a big contribution by signing a signature campaign on the web or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million «actions» from their supporters, with a lot of different objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements as a result of their shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding has had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and founders based in the United Kingdom who will "help children exploit their full potential" and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate faulty nutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice by undernourished a footnote in history," Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 shares in the United Kingdom in order to obtain better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In response to one of the usual questions on the website, ‘What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?’
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult way – among other things we will fall and fail.
But as the important rights of citizens and the anti-partie movement before us, we will succeed because we stand together stronger.
Janet Jackson, from Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae, is one of the artists who will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman on this year's event in New York.
The United States may use the Navy as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - the Minister of the Interior
Washington may ‘if necessary’ for the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating at the invitation of the legal government – is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to handle this.
‘The US has the capacity to ensure that the waterways are open through the sea and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy does not reach the market’, he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organisation that profiled itself as the ‘voice of energy consumers’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of communicating with Russia and Iran, and he noticed that they are far from equal.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel’, he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The opinions came from the fact that the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and they want to replace Russia, the most affordable alternative for European consumers.
Therefore, employees of the Trump administration, including the President himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the «inappropriate» project the Northern European Gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin ‘capture’ in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's glowing opposition to the project is only justified by economic reasons and is an example of regular competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, BDI, has requested the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have major problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” on his presidential candidacy for 2020, Senator of Massachusetts says.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would “consider seriously” whether she would stand as the presidential candidate after the elections.
During a voter's meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she'd be quiet.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix the shocking government, and it includes a woman on top,” she said.
‘After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether to appoint as President’.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the voter's meeting and said he was "in the wrong direction".
“I’m completely worried about the margin of what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday tweet, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI review before we vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own electors do not believe that it should stop by 2020.
58% of ‘probable’ voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stop, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The survey showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in the context of a possible candidate in 2020 are among others Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
The prayer said he would decide officially by January," reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being recruited in seven.
He was arrested and targeted for a domestic violence incident Monday night
“My son is going through, what he is going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with him”, she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest ‘the elephant in the room’ and said about the son and other war veterans: ‘They come home a little changed, they come home the shepherd, they come home and wonder whether this is the respect of their military cameras and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country’.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and targeted for domestic violence on a woman's behalf, silenced with a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was engaged, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the police in Wasilla.
18 countries and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Eight states and District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that rejects asylum for victims fleeing from domestic or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented a briefing from amibus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union brought against the federal police in August has not been published.
She claimed that the partner ‘and his violent son-in-law’ abused her, but US officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations with comprehensive problems of gender and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a decision in 2014 by the Immigration Court of Appeal which gave undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence the right to apply for asylum.
State attorney Karl Racine in the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is missing from many decades by state, federal and international law".
«Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle» said the orientation of amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that denied immigrants access is detrimental to the US economy and that there is a great likelihood that they will become more and "help with the necessary labour force".
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to provide asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and violence in June.
‘Assylicity is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view’, the Sessions said in their announcement of 11 June on the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu – the deaths double in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she comforts her feverish son at an evacuation center in the busiest city of Palu.
«All the time you see ambulances getting killed.
Clean water is scarce.’
It was possible to see residents who came to their homes destroyed and easily through damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake of magnitude 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside the Palus military hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes as he repeats how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
«We did not have time to save ourselves safely.
I was horrified by the wall that rests together, I think," said Harris to the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to participate in a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘tracing’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper launched a four-page ad in an American newspaper that denounced the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the annex China Daily paid to enter the Des Moines Register — the largest newspaper in Iowa — after having accused China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November, a Chinese indictment rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China, American officials said Reuters.
It is quite normal for foreign authorities to use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked up in a escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new tariffs on each other's imports.
China's criminal duty early in the trade war was to strike export holdings in countries like Iowa, which supported Trump's republican party, reporting Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former multi-year governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a readership in the Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China now steps up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities take advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press we enjoy in America to place a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast – at the abbey of the street here in Beijing, you do not find many divergent opinions and cannot experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: ‘One of China’s biggest newspapers refused to publish’ his article, even though he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare women's electors before the inter-election with the Kavanaugh fades, warns analysts
Since many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several charges of sexual abuse against themselves, analysts warn that they will receive a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to move on with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse Universities Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI review in the last few seconds would be enough to calm down the mind voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
Friday morning, singing demonstrators «November is coming!» while they demonstrated in the run of the Senate when the Republicans controlling the judicial committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
«Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode» said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
However, it could have been higher, particularly among female unsecured voters in the seats and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote even if they cheat the president.”
Even before Ford’s public witness, which gave a detailed description of the charges of sexual assault against the highest-level candidate, it was thought that there would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans were forced through the nomination.
“This has become a blessed root for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not only about the Committee’s vote or the final approval or the inclusion of Kavanaugh – it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,” said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on whom to believe in the cold water of the Fords and Kavanaugh testimonies, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were completely or quite convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38% said that they were quite or totally convinced that Kavanaugh was lying under their testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the Flake game, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's judicial committee during the past week that Kavanaugh was in a state of abuse when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the highest-ranking candidate exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web author plans to launch a new web to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where to store their data and who have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the purpose is “world domination”.
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
«It is a historic moment».
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own ‘personal data storage online’ or a POD.
It may include contact lists, working lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser simultaneously.
What's unique about the personal data storage online is that it's up to the user who should have access to that kind of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company must provide resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work with the project and a second volunteer programmer.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to «Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which would make their business models completely overcast overnight.
‘We do not ask for their permission’.
In an article on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bernard Water: Celebration of the Victorian recipient from World War I
The only priest in the English church who was awarded a Victorian Corsica during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his home town after 100 years.
Colonel and priest Bernard Water was awarded the certificate of honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellengliese and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military designation.
A monument was discovered by his two children at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a “fine symbolism” in that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s winning award.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Water battalion headed its over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under strong protection from field cannons and masking weapons”.
Later he turned to the shooting line and led the line “with great opposition” ahead before storming a field cannon on his own and knocking out three of the departments.
Colonel Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Water also laid down a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he “felt very honoured to play a part in the parade” and added: “The beatty of a true person is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people”.
MMA supporters were up all night to watch the combat sports program Bellator 206, instead they got the Peppa pig
Make sure you've been awake all night to see the densely packed Bellator 206, just to find out you can't see the main fight.
The participant from San Jose managed 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom sat down to mow when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after being awake until early morning to see the battle.
A fan described on Twitter the transition to the children's program as "a kind of sick joke".
‘It is State regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00 so that they could switch to children’s programmes,’ said Dave Schwartz, Senior Wise President of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the transmission.
"Peppa grey, yes!".
Bellator's Managing Director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the mission plan to include the viewers in Storbrtannia in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the purpose of the fight," said Coker.
«But it is six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me-- when we switched over, there were many messages going forward and back, and they weren't exactly the friendly kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of authority.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five matches – which we usually send – and we tried to extend far beyond the trailers, but tipped over.
This is an unfortunate situation.’
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic runner Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority toward everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it wasn't before in high school he realized that "he wasn't like others".
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of the homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned with winning OL.
The regular programmer of the traditional rich programme, Kirsty Young, shall be away for a few months due to the disease.
Daley came forward as a little off Laverne's first mission and said he felt “less worth” than everyone else he grew up with because “it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls”.
He said, "To this day, these feelings are of being inferior and different who have been the real motivation and have the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in the OL and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador. He has used his participation in the World Cup in Australia to appeal for several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels lucky he can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three times the world champion said that he fell in love with a man - filmmakers Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "suddenly".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, yesterday, but he said the age difference had never been any problem.
'When you go through so much in such a young age'--he participated in his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" his had changed.
“If you had asked me yesterday, everything turned out that I just had to win a gold medal,” he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than gold medals in OL.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he should die, and one of the last things he asked if they had obtained tickets to London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in OL 2012 and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – standing in front of a home audience under the OL, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song – Proud of Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the ride before the O.L. and which still gives him gauze skin.
Desert Island Discs goes on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Formswake Mickelson took out the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Cup fight, but he has to get in shape if it won't be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the impressive 12th-time biennial, was placed on the bench of the team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome camps.
Instead of being in the center of the event, which he had so often been for the United States, it divides five times the major winner the day between being a healer and working with his game on the rank in hopes of fixing what's going on.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even at the top of the career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National track, where the long rough area still penalizes the savages.
And if the course itself is not frightening enough, meets Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, the very British Open-Master Francesco Molinari, who has met with the new beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of the matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's games can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Fury expressed his trust in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
«He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed so much to these layers earlier and this week.
I don't think I saw him playing two games.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we should do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven unsolved, but Furyk said his participation brought some intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny and likes to drive with others. He’s a nice guy to have in the storage room,” he explained.
«I think the younger players had the pleasure of trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entrance to the last day’s single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where a side led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the carriage to the winner with the least possible margin, 141⁄2-131.2.
"You still remember yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so," said Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on that team that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Come out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have got the points on the table.
We have one goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bear is very pleased with how his players have managed on the dumb golf course and add: “I couldn’t do it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow is the individual performances that are in the center, and there's something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer is tested to the full.
That's the message you have to share with the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to provide better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three of the four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the big revolutions the last day. He was on the victory team at Brooklyn before he ended up losing when Europe carried out the “miracle at Medina”.
I remember every damn word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had been here with his players at the entrance to the last day.
"We have 12 major battles tomorrow, but you would like to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brooklyn, which we saw at Medina.
When the moment begins to go in one direction, it puts a great pressure on the middle matches.
We'll arrange our setup then and send out the people in the way we feel about it.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top fight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the game order.
“I’m betting on this group of men in that order because I think it’s all the way,” said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warships delayed once again
Germany's latest fleet would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the cold war, but this will not happen until the next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leader of the brand new Fragates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been exposed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, who quoted a military figure.
The ship would have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems of delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered the Marines back in 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they should be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-shipping missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from home port.
However, slow delays mean that the advanced warships – they were told to strengthen Germany at sea – will already be out of date before they are put into service, Die Zeit reports.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines yesterday, when the German Navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship has to be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the crew of the older Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces performance and limits the marine capacity for future upgrades.
The 7000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price gap on the whole project – including human training – has become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of fresh warnings that Germany’s marine strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's Defence Committee, confirmed that the Navy is actually ‘empty for usable ships’.
The officer said that the problem has been escalating over time because old ships were exhausted, but there was no new ship.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust Stealers on the Secret Life of Flag Museums
New research carried out at a country property in the high country of Scotland shall reveal how the flag mouse uses the landscape in the hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual flag and flag as well as well as the well-run and water flag at the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flag musculoskeletal activity during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The sound analyses of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the flag flies and what species to do.
Then there will be a habitat map and a report to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be part of the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the installation of pasture grounds and how best to take care of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The Flemish population of Scotland and the United Kingdom have deteriorated considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and construction activities that affect young people’s places and the restriction of habitat.
Windmills and lighting may also constitute a risk, the same as flue paper and certain chemically treated building materials, as well as attacks from household taxes.
Flaggermouse is not actually blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for the ears than for the eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced ecolocation to find insects and obstacles on the way when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flag mouse very seriously.
They have 10 qualified experts who regularly carry out studies, youth site mapping and rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own flagship reserve at Thrave Land Property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flagship species.
Property Manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a perfect area for bats," he says.
«We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to do to thrive."
He stresses the importance of mapping the flag mice before maintaining a property since the unpredictable destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps exploiting a whole local population.
Flagged mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them or destroy their youth sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish staff member of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help in the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and too many of the species we just don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of violence while lawyers are going to file a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the charges of violence against himself as “false news” and says that people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375 000 later for keeping close to the event," Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers several hours after the charges were reported, 33 years old Ronaldo rejected the charges as “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says five times they win the Golden Ball into the camera.
«They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving me my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to file a case against Der Spiegel on the grounds of the claims that they have called ‘an unacceptable manufacturing of suspicions in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the football player will seek compensation for ‘damage damage to an extent equivalent to the degree of seriousness of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years’.
The alleged event must have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have returned to the football player’s room, where he would have allegedly raped her analytics, according to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was ‘99 % good man’ who was defeated by the ‘one percent’.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they found a settlement outside the court because she was "reverent for revenge" and was also concerned about being "sanctioned".
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to make the comparison side by side because she's still traumatized after the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom “will make sure forever” to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom will “will care forever” if they lose their status as world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was ‘disturbed’ that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing at any Brexit may mean fewer jobs without an agreement.
The Burnaston plant – producing Toyotas Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars yesterday, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, experience that production at our factory stops”, said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says they're going to shut down the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what car manufacturers say is supply chain risks for any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of ‘order as required’, and it reaches parts every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, which the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day stock at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa Mays Brexit’s plan for further relations with the EU is ‘precisely set up to avoid such controls at the border’.
"We need an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that makes us, as I say, not only able to enjoy success at the moment, but we can take this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
‘The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.’
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that increased costs in the long term would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and after each loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the trade union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back".
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be exposed again,' said the White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Wise Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein may be "exposed for another week" while the fight around the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and possible obstacles to the rule of law on the part of the President.
The question of Trump will be whether or not to overthrow the Minister of Justice, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been touching for many months during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Supplement to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to evict voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would “like to let go” to kick Rosenstein, but then he was exposed to the fact that it coincided with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI review of charges against Kavanaugh for one week, which further put a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I understood it could be a week's postponement because of everything that happens with the highest right.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will contest that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Softwared Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to opposition to the “self-goodness” of TV reporters, although she added: “I do not disagree with their self-goodness”.
Then she indicated that the contact between Trump and the press would become more frequent.
‘The President is doing more questions than any previous president,’ she said and added without providing proof: ‘We have seen the figures’.
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President directly in the United States, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to get it often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's gonna replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open establishments or press conferences when visiting important persons.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible reason when he ran a solo race and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Service) to express its gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish member of parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the announcement of the release have taken place in the summer and are expected to land on a solution to the harvest.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I will therefore repeat how much I value the effort of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and outside, provide valuable experience and expertise that enhances and improves the health service for the best of the patients and local communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely their home and we sincerely hope that you will be here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes rapid surgery after head injury
Defence Player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee State's chief coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
“He came out on the side line and just collapsed there,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they placed him on a carrier and took him back for further investigation.
A staff member from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated by Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘not yet available information on the type/size of the damage’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five rounds Saturday before he finished the fight, which gives a total of 18 rounds for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom.
The change will neutralise the success of Corby's plan to attract young voters
The document fee increase will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Experts in the Department of Finance expect it to increase to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corby's plan to attract young voters with the promise of offering more reasonable housing and setting up high-income groups.
The increase in document fees will be imposed on persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will strengthen the government's measures to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on the number of dwellings two and the purchase of dwellings for rent – may be as much as 3 %.
The Department of Finance expects the measure to amount to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which is price-driven and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become ‘spoiling towns’ because of the many foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
The new policy will only come weeks after Boris Johnson came up with a proposal to reduce the document fee to help several young people to own their own home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May should refuse allowances on reasonable housing to solve Britain’s ‘near housing policy’.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an insightful series of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unwarranted projects.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater power to build new dwellings.
May said: “Yesterday I said that I would devote my time as a minister of state to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our demolished housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy dwellings that are too hard-working British citizens.
Too many people have the dream of owning their own home too far away, and the worthless situation of homeless people.”
Jack Ross: «My final goal is to lead Scotland»
Sunderland's chief, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager before or since.
The 42-year-old boy enjoys the challenge of reliving the club in the north-east, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after having led St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
«I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
«But I was often with my father and saw Scotland on the Hampden as a child, and it is always something that pulls me back.
However, that possibility would only come if I succeeded in the club club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief said he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and had previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
«Success for me at the moment will be measured whether I can get the club back in Premier League».
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they are part of the Premier League,” he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself to be successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance in Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloa to return from depression to the third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of the depression to win the title of the master next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a proper road difference,” he recalls when he took over the management of Alloa.
«I really thought management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds nice since I did it well, created me a reasonable income of it and experienced some fine highlights.

Summer's heat wave has strengthened the revenues of Britain's hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubers and bars experienced an increase in turnover of 2,7 % in July – while the revenues for restaurants fell 4,8 %, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, a company consultant at CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “Continuance of the sun shine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup followed a pattern similar to that of the previous month in June, when the pubs rose by 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 % in the restaurant supply in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-just than that restaurant went down.
Puber with food serving also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the restaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, turnover increased by 6,6 % that month, with food service decreased by 3 %».
Paul Newman, an analyst from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social arrangements are still the main factors in the field of market access.
There is no surprise that restaurant groups are still having difficulty, and a 4,8 % year-on-year turnover fall will be particularly painful at the top of the current cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving companies, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a prolonged breathing room».
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in the rollover of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry turnover controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyzes the results from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
One of five children – someone is only 11 years old – has secret accounts on social media that they hide for parents and teachers, showing research
A study of 20,000 youth school students discovered ‘fake Insta’ pages.
The news has raised concerns about sharing sexual content.
20 % of students said they have a ‘main account’ that they show their parents.
One of five children – someone is only 11 years old – creates social media accounts that they keep hidden for adults.
A study involving 20,000 young students revealed rapid growth in Fake Insta accounts – a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about sharing sexual content.
20 % of the students said they had an innocent ‘main account’ which they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “violently rape me”.
The research, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors’ Conference (HMC) on Private Schools, revealed that 40 % of 11 to 18 years old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is scary that so many young people are being tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilid Doyle will be the voice of the peacekeepers on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilid Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated peacekeeper, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the right to gain insight into her extensive international experience over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide peacekeeping environment, and we are sure that peacekeepers in Scotland will enjoy getting her into the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am eager to act as a voice for peacekeepers, and I hope I have much to contribute to guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 meters under the OL in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four OL gold. She is now a solid BBC expert, and after she had a transient ischemic attack, she was unable to go.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I got hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will show me whether I will be returned and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm all right again and I've learned to go again, and today I'm doing soft exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows divides the opinion on the web
A breast pump company has split the opinion on the web with an ad comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be ‘the world’s first soundless breast pump carried close to the body’, Elvie, the technology-based consumer product company, issued a fresh and floating, music-inspired ad to show the freedom of the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a livol full of tall and cows to a song with, among other things, the following text: ‘Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see any tails’ and ‘In case you don’t understand it, this is not jury, it’s my dolls’.
The choir continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say the concept of “grossness” in the dairy industry.
«Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," he wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets a nice place in an amme-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: «Probably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: ‘For a failed ad’.
Others defend the ad, a woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd love to have one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a bit spicy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," it was one that wrote.
Another commented: ‘This is a fun announcement directed at mothers as pumps (often at work or toilets) and feels like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad praising or condemning the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discrete pump in the bh.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women pumping, they say, feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and gets a fine place in an amme-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and even walk out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: «The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put searchlight on breast pumping and all the challenges, while we show in a entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom of the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a babysitter appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tentyard at the Texas border in secret
The number of migrant children detained has continued even though the monthly cross-border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children among supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of being in the country by stepping forward and demanding a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the immigration and customs authorities, testified to the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to be supporters of single minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested did not previously have a criminal scroll.
‘Approximately 80 % of the persons who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecute these people," says Albence.
The officers are trying to handle the children more quickly and introduce new rules which imply that some of them must meet in court within one month of being arrested and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to receiving workers.
Many will be produced through videoconferencing instead of meeting personally to conduct their case of residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those considered as unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer the children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who tire more easily are translated because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tentacle without having enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to friends can strengthen the traumas that many are already suffering.
Syria requests the US, French and Turkish ‘occupational powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also acting as Minister of State, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the cover of combating terrorism and ‘will be treated afterwards’.
‘They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,’ he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism is over” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the move.
He said that Damascus will continue to “maintain this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories” for both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence”.
The United States has around 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and counselling of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-lorded country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘some Western countries’ of ‘screaming irrational refugees’ who keep the refugees away.
“We have approached the international community and humanitarian organisations to arrange for these returns”, he said.
They're policing what's really a purely humanitarian situation."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria before a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defence position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including Al-Qaida-related warriors, who would be ‘destroyed’.
United Nations mission Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draw up a post-war law for Syria and the road to new elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘the review of the articles of the current Basic Law’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a period of
After that logic, Trump would have won the re-election in 2020, unless many liberal spectators were likely to hope that the rule of law and scandal would end the presidency before that time.
In what would naturally be "the most dramatic end of a Presidency ever!"
At the moment, there's no sign of vision.
Since 2014, the best-end watch counts have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC «The Rachel Maddow Show» has peaked the cable numbers with a total of 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news items.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, programme director of the ABC “Designated Survival” drama, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and author of «Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club», has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
It's a value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Release is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go a long way to be an informed person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "dickness in the background" for the book Fair, Paul Manafort's Learny with Stratted Spring World $15,000 (“A Plague Spilled with Hybrids”, said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh ..., anatomy.
I don't want to look at Super Mario the same way anymore.
“One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, the daily manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars”, about Trump’s varied role crew and daily twists on the plot (crowd with NFL, shame Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll hang up.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27 °C and the sun outside his house on the north coast of Kaui, Hawaii, but he moved in and looked at MSNBC while he picked up CNN.
He could not break free, not when Brett Kavanaugh is to meet the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the US Supreme Court is at stake.
"I remember when we put all those dirty programs in old times and people said that this is the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Non-cash cash flows into the most frequent proxy of the House of Representatives
There is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania experienced a flow of money after the conversion of a congressional district that ended up two representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly established suburban district in Pittsburgh is located with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won its seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb stands against another seated representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is largely overlapping the new 17th district.
The map was redrawed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were a fundamentally contentious manipulation of the electoral circles in favour of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race on campaign financing between the largest party funding groups, DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a closely followed supplemental election for Pennsylvania 18th district to Congress in March last year.
The seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little leadership.
USA Evaluated criminal action against El Salvador for support to China, then pulled the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team of Trump Organisation.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw the US diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Naurut, the spokesperson of the Department, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalties were assessed only against El Salvador, which was estimated to receive $140 million in U.S. assistance in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed criminal measures, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials were exposed to a summit conference focusing on security and economic growth in order to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by the middle of September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now set up to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance of the administration adding the collection, said the diplomat.
And the three U.S. broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new bold messages or sanctions from Washington.
A speaker at the White House for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the basis of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next speaker in the box may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to legal practice, which is now very solid evidence for in public documents.
Mueller is also likely to expand the examination of whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering with our elections.
If the Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held responsible in that body, in the midst of preparations to meet the electors again and perhaps finally a jury of his equals.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not mean to say that Trump's case is inevitable – nor for his opponents in Europe.
We must all have a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years with bloodbath that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or blocked.
The Americans are facing several of these fluctuations now.
What will we do if Trump kicks out the justice minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a harsh mood since this newspaper reported that yesterday he proposed secret executions by the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says the Times' production is wrong.
‘How will we react if the recently launched FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is granted the highest right in spite of credible accusations of abuse and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not have those tests, democracy will be faced with a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the experiences I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me away to light the Sabbath light on the table with the crochet cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I stop looking optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, confident that victory over the Austrians after the impressive undisputed struggle in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A broken obstructed midway player Graham Dorrans in making his first performance for the season in the undecided fight 2-2 against Villareal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villareal is a good team," said the 31st.
"We went into the game and thought we could get something and got with us one point.
Maybe we could have done it at the end, but it was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first round, and we came out in the second round and were the best team.
On Thursday it will be a big evening in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last fight, but with the home population in my back, I'm sure we can stand up and get a positive result.
The four years were absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boy is choosing; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand now, put the last season behind us and get it to it."
Women lose their sleep at night because of fear of retirement
Although the participants in the study had a clear pattern of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they talked to the spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, wise president of the National Widen Life Insurance Business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not say what you want in good time in advance.
Discussions with the advisor and the family where and how care should be given. Such choices may have a major role in determining the costs.
Include your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
The funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Create your legal documents: Clear legal problems at the same time.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that health workers will comply with your wishes if you should be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in a list so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that is at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
«What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that list in place.’
Man shot several times with an air weapon in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a gun when he was on his way home after a nightfall.
The offer, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a «unrelenting action».
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police have sought witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the numbers are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Dongala's accountancy, an area north of Palu, which is more sensitive to the earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donghala is an accountant that extends over 300 km with a coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The accounting, an administrative region below provincial level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the central province of Sulawesis, in particular the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Emergency Administration.
In 1938 a tsunami struck more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Ocean Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the north coast of the Indonesian Aceh province of Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 south hit Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7,5 struck one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that ravaged thousands of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake struck the regent Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people were reminded of the herrings of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombo and kill more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested after charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested after an assault.
Palin, 29 years from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, culling with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he must have taken the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin will be jailed in Mat-Su prison and held for an insecure debt worth $500, reported KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, when he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when he was asked how he dealt with the guilt issue, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three offences of Class A, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and imposed a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
This is not the first time that Palin's intention has been expressed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged attack.
The case will be brought before Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for domestic violence, silenced with the report on domestic violence, and to hold a weapon while he was engaged in the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by groups of veterans in 2016 after her violent behaviour of the son to PTSD after service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: more than 100 deaths
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and deaths are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck at the center of Sulawesi, northeastern Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami ravaged the beach.
Federal Prosecution Authorities Rarely Seek Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Rape in New York
New York's federal prosecutors are looking for a death penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist crime who has killed eight people — a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, apparently used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he aimed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘intelligent’ and caused serious bodily harm on purpose, according to a notice of intention to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for a possible death penalty, according to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal court ruled out the 22nd point sentence, including eight sentences for murder in connection with money-pression, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a sentence for violence and vehicle robbery.
The attack required ‘significant planning and intention’, said the actor, who described the way Saipov performed it as ‘healthy, cruel and plundered’.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, says the notice of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the previous Southern District of New York conducted a case that could result in a death penalty.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York, in 1953 there was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no indication in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after having seen ISIS videos on the cell phone, as intended.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung on the hospital, the police said.
He did not declare himself guilty of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed Saipov defenders, said they were "evidently disappointed" over the decision of the prosecution authority.
“We believe that the decision to apply for a death penalty instead of accepting an admission and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the traumas of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilise the people’s army” today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should get "the pressure" from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be held responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom “city had been wiped out” now if Farage was Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge for May in reconciling its deep split lines has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in their own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Minister of State is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of the backdrop – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Boe told the Solihull's "Denomination" demonstrators that he wanted to reject the Brexit Plan.
He proposed that Farage should have been made a member and held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had had the responsibility, we would have been out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit Plan".
When explaining his resistance to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone disproved claims that the People's Assembly had changed since the vote in 2016: "The claim that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is a complete mistake."
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkyn also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: "I say quite simply: Minister of State, listen to the people.
"The Brexit Plan is not popular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in the party and in our activists, who are actually those who cross the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening.’
In a direct message to May, she added: “Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises”.
Farage stated that politicians would be "in a sense of pressure" if they were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about trust between us – the people – and the politicians," he said.
‘They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they will not get away with it’.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.'
During marched Remainers through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis cut off the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a free-of-fits limit, for free-trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
«It is a complete farce.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren takes it seriously to stand up as a presidential candidate
USA Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "evaluate seriously to stand as the presidential candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about the future during a meeting in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, makes a re-election in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was the wise-man of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central to the speculations about whether she's going to stand up to Trump in 2020.
The arrangement Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the council format since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she was planning to sit down as the president's candidate.
Warren replied that it is time that “women come to Washington to fix our faulty government, and it includes a woman at the top”.
Arrested after the death of Sims from LSU during shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting episode as a dead LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Diteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 p.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
«Wayde Sims got a headache and died as a result of it» said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde grabbed in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene and had a gun with him, and he admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without hesitation and put in custody by East Baton Rouge Parish politicians.
Sims was a two meter high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 start last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton looks into the title of the world's championship after the stable orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stable orders would play a major role in the course.
From Pole Bottas got a good start and fed nearly Hamilton of the course while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to drive in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some push with the wheels that made the Ferrari-led opposing lot inside be free after a double pass to defend himself in third turn.
Max Versteppen started from the back row of the field and entered as number seven at the end of the first round of his 21st birthday.
Then he led in large parts of the course while he was lying on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and overcome Kimi Raikkonen who was lying as number four.
He finally entered the 44th round depot, but failed to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good top," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump bribed Senator Diane Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her detention that she did not play the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee. Instead, he commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people are "disgusting, false and abusive".
“The only thing that could happen and the pleasant thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are sick and sick and sick and talk rudely,” he said.
«When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, "Oh, I haven't done it.
I have not done it.’»
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you play?
Do you remember the answer to her... you played the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not played».»
Hey, wait a minute.
We played... no, we didn't play," he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was played earlier in September--but Feinstein refused to let the leak come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't play her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
«She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidentially as she asked for».
But her denial was not received by the president, who, during the party event Saturday evening, commented: "I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defence of the highest-ranking candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the President indicated that the democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to withdraw the power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two targets for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars set up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return campaign in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got a two-way lead early through the shooting of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie paid off for the site before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard paid for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the winner.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the layers, and Giants had won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford released the game when Beauvilier doubled management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan returned home to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt placed up to Cownie's balance at 15:16.
Dwyer assured that Giants had the management at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced once again with a noble goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen to give Dundee leadership for the first time during the fight late in the second round, and he secured the winner with the team's women halfway out in the end.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure that several hundred air passengers escape earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is hailed as just after he died and made sure that a plane that had many hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He became to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway just then, could safely ease.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died in a hospital later.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia reported ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard it,” he added.
The authorities are afraid that the numbers of deaths may rise to thousands, and the disaster relief body of the country reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donghala, Sigi and Boutong.
‘The figures are expected to increase further since many equals are still trapped during the ruins and many have not been able to reach,’ said the spokesperson for the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have razed Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances getting killed.
There's a lack of clean water.
The retail markets are run all over.’
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross works in February to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesia's President Yoko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you clear?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after flight crash in the lagoon
The airline that owned the plane as crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one man is missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats help save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while they tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been transported to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was bombed on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to swim through mid-deep water to the emergency exit of the descending plane.
He said that the air hosts were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy told seafarers who worked nearby to repair a brewer, also helped in the rescue work by using a blowable boat to load people in the country before the plane dropped about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in a crash with PNG-registered aircraft in the last 20 years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyser presents the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The contracting authorities concluded the procedure on Saturday in a new case for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
USA Analysts in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as an expert on intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phones to push together the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he picked up location data from several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, something that was contrary to what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as the cell phone of Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went into the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the actor asked about Tellis speaking the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer of Sanford that night, Sanford said that he “lying because my trailer was in Nashville”.
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints indicate that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, she deleted Tellis' call, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from her phone.
"He removed her from her life," said Hale.
The defence shall begin its proceedings on Sunday in accordance with the plan.
The judge said he expected the case to be left to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
New York Children's Passersby seeks a couple of withdrawals after a "racist" message
A childcareer in New York pleads for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong message from the mother, who complained that she was ‘only a black person’.
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the case with ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a lunatic mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new passenger, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first working day in 2016.
'NOEEEEILY ONE SMART PERSON', Plasco-Faxman wrote to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the taboo, it was a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Faxman who said Maurice, claiming that their child-passer, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice seeks compensation for the cancellation and requires compensation in the order of $350 per day for the six-month, loose-based arrangement she was promised, but without contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t do that,” she said to New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back the charges that they are racist and say the cancellation of Maurice was the only right thing, since they did not feel they could rely on her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco to New York Post.
«But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even though it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on.
The comparison of the case with ‘expression’ is said by Plasco that his wife had only two months to maturity and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
«Is that the person you want to punish?
It is not particularly fine» added the share mixer.
While the legal case is going on, the public court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticise them for their behaviour and attitudes.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was adopted, said about the letter: "It's difficult to put oneself in place when they first read it before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says that the father, who had worked as a cameraman in BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book of a small tube ring, would have been very pleased that his work had been turned off, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book was "biter-sweet" after he left yesterday.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father secretly was very proud of his success.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a weird person," she said.
«But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child making a joke: you are proud of it even though it is not your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to honor Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone
On landing, the daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors were given the job to save her life.
“Nadd called regularly to say that it was so bad that he didn’t think she would survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So I got the phone from Nad who said she came to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy for you, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine had given her to get her heart to beat, lost slowly her effect and left the system.
She died a while ago and the organs in the body hit together.
I just had to sit there and wait, for sure it happened.
I couldn't say hello and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now concerned about the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the tests she was going through.
“No one knew,” she says.
«I looked down all the time and the tears rolled in an even stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards with mourning women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a postcard on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and telephone numbers can call to get help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was affected by depression and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day,” she says.
45 years old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him on the smile.
They said that his smile could brighten up any room."
He ended up at work before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I'm worried all the time that it's going to be an infectious effect."
Sharon added the cards “to tell people that there are people out there who can go to and talk to, even though it is just a friend.
Not for yourself--you have to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
‘He didn’t tell me he felt down or depressed or something,’ she says.
«A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mindset.
On 1st Christmas he was in the basement – when the children opened the Christmas celebrations, they did not get eye contact or anything.”
She said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to fight through it: "It breaks up a great hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is hanging in a thin thread while the FBI is starting to investigate
“I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for – a time- and scope-limited review – we might be able to reach a certain agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid that the committee “fell apart” along the fixed party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to review?
The motive was due to the timing.
The middle elections are only five weeks away, 6 November – if the Republicans are likely to do so, it will be much more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called the senators and run lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him placed in the highest court.
Number of North Korean droplets under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from South Korea's collection department, said it had been 1127 hopes yesterday – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on it publicly.
Most of the refugees from North Korea are subsequently granted citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most refugees across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, are easier to cross than the strictly demilitarized zone between the two Korean countries.
China considers the dropouts to be illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between the North and the South – which is technically still at war – has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks on the denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, laid the blame for the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will settle unilaterally first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the highest right
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Right Candidate Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical" and said he had a temper that made him unfit to sit in the highest right.
Pelosi came with the opinions in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could only imagine that if a woman had acted this way, she would have been called hysterical”, Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the feeling that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, including almost crying and crying when he spoke about his family and years of higher education.
He was also strongly condemning the democrats of the committee and calling his claims against him a "gross and coordinated character killing" organised by liberals who were afraid that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he can't sit in the highest court since it shows that he's prejudiced against democrats.
“I think he’s disqualificating himself with such opinions and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi heard when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh for the government if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the highest court, but also in the court he is currently sitting in,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he was considered a conservative judge.
In the inquiry, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the highest right and expect us to applaud it,” said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair grief, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're sick," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so nice, do you?"
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also wept when she was sitting, but had developed a technique that meant that when she was sitting and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to “you may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm crazy."
And then she just went on.
And I thought that was fantastic."
Tears are permitted as an end to pain partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was at a man-dominated office. I started crying with unexplained anger and was caught in the throat of an older woman — a cold boss I had always been a bit afraid of — who took me to a stairwell.
"Let them never see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will think you're sorry and happy because they were able to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was discovered to be unfaithful to the spouse on board a boat named Monkey Business and withdrawn from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of becoming a presidential candidate himself.
“It wasn’t a deliberate decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
«There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
Since it was the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and swore that she wouldn't shut up if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her just $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount, or?" she wonders.
When she held the speech to announce that she did not want to launch a formal campaign, she became overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money and reach electors instead of delegates, and mind over sexism – that she fell down in tears.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Schroeder about how the press referred to her.
"You should think that Kleinex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking my faith what they would write on my tomb support?
'She's crying?''
How the US-China Wars Can Win Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were earmarking, and although the fight is far from over, a gap between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by adding customs duties on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The main escalation took place this week with new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs duties of half of all goods imported to the USA from China.
Beijing has, of course, repaid every time, now at the latest with an attack of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US attack on the attack, and the next largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
To get Washington to step down means to give up for demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, the pressure surrounding the US trade war can give China a long-term positive score by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision, whether in Washington or Beijing, could create conditions that start economic ring-fence in one of the countries, is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have previously realized,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ for return of refugees, Minister of Foreign Affairs says
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to return to the country, which is hastened after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's situation was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism”, he says.
The State continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures imposed on them by their daily lives and bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million oxygens have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would take good care to rebuild the damaged country.
However, he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion would not be accepted.
Europe guarantees Ryder Cup victories in Paris
Team Europe won 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times each other on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe restored the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn received the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The United States star Phil Mickelson, who was totally under the major parts of the tournament, wounded his tea-types in the water at a pair of-316 holes, and had to look turned off by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was turned off 5 and 4 by the lowest ranking player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With a total of eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind it, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful Europeans in the tournament through the times with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t leave.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very glad to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He leaves the staff of his countryman John Ram, who beat the American golfer Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in solo games on Sunday.
“I am incredibly proud of beating Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely in the harvest,” said 23 years old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career score in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just turned off Jack Nicklus.
Team USA spent the whole weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Fury of the United States said after a disappointing performance for his troops, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
It was just this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hate off for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of the players he played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I want to see the future.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.’
