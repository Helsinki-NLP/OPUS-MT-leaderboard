Members of the Valjan Congregation are concerned that they are “like Mupetkom”
Some members of the congregation are threatened by the proposal to be appointed MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, or member of the Valjan Parliament).
This was the result of plans to change the name of the assembly into the Valijan Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum worry about smiling.
A member of the Labour Congregation said that they were concerned about their group, “because the name rhyme with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Valjanština twp means crapast and pwp kakati.
A member of the assembly of the Plaid Cymru party said that their group as a whole was “not satisfied” and suggested other options.
The Valijan Conservative said that his group was an ‘open spirit’ with regard to the change of name, but also warned that there was a small difference between MWP and Muppet’s words in the statement.
In this context, the word "w" is similar to the word "u" in the Yorkshire word.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing a draft legislation to present a change of name, said: "The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be taken by members themselves."
By law of the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Valijan Assembly was given the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valijan Parliament Assembly.
For members of the assembly, the Commission has chosen the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but has received the most support in public consultation with the option ‘MWP’.
Members of the congregation are obviously proposing other options, but reaching agreement will be a difficult task for the Presidential Officer Elin Jones, who will have to submit a draft amendment legislation within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes in the way the congregation operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the functioning of its members and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their appointment.
The Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to "North Macedonia".
By vote, they want to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its province named Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time insisted that the name of their northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its request for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s Church have been silenced because the churches in Harle face problems
“The older people I spoke to say that sometimes there were bars and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today there is not one other.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People today are different.
The bars are no longer the living room of the neighbors where people start regularly.’
However, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect and that soon they will be back at the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced with housing buildings with a common administration (condominium) where people would live who would not help shelter in the remaining neighborhoods.
“Most people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and that is why the day will soon come when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that people who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the black religious community, which was carrying out a service nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of Honorary John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of salesmen who did not want to hire or support blacksmiths on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild, they ordered bells to be held.
To honor David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in the Church of St. Martin’s, he proudly called bells “the bells of poor people”.
The expert who was arrested in July referred to them in a slightly different way: the “cultural treasure” and the “unreplaceable historical instrument”.
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by a dark musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was arrested for major bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he had not been replaced in the Church of St. Martin’s.
In the church of St. Martin’s, a complicated story has taken place in the last few months with architects and contractors; some have brought church times and others have the schofia.
Zakristija – the administrative body of the parish, composed of the times – wrote to the bishop in July that she was concerned that the bishop would "try to transfer costs" to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the shop.
Sea dog damaged a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that in California on Saturday, a sea dog attacked and damaged a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters during the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the TV KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning about half an hour he got warmed up with his friends when he heard the boy scream for help, and then he went off to him with the group and helped him pull it out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy was just excited because he caught the lobster, and then he realized that he was screaming "He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed he had a broken whole key.
“I’ve made everyone cry out to get out of the water: ‘There’s a sea dog in the water!’” he added.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of sea dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a sea dog had been observed in this area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injury to the upper part of the body.
In 48 hours they have disabled access from the beach Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the beach Swami’s in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sea dogs in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful corners, as they have in shrines, and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beauty market, which is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while the sale of clothing and household appliances is falling, larger beauties will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the following year in more shops if they prove successful.
They have decided to invest in beautiful products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves previously used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s they say they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brand offer will also get more space in areas with trademarks similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also revitalises its boutique supply of cosmetic products, so that most vegan products – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop’s perfume will test the concession in two Sainsbury’s shops. The first one opened in Croydon in South London last week, and the second one will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
Due to the online purchase and daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local stores, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores would be similar to supermarkets because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-animal products.
Sainsbury’s group has opened outlet Argos in hundreds of shops and also Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased the sales of food, and the acquisitions were more profitable.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to renew their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s flew a joint promotion with the Chain Boots at the beginning of the 21st century, but the bond ended after the dispute over the distribution of profits from drugs in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 shops to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago.
They announced that Lloyds would play a role in this plan as they would expand the offer of luxury leather brands in four stores, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, the attractive environment and the handy locations mean that we are now an interesting beautiful destination that poses a challenge to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones was "rage" because Holly Willoughby got away from a job worth 11 million pounds.
The star plays Dragons Dan (Good Business) is angry because the TV director Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from work worth 11 million pounds, with his trademark of life style to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothes and Truly's accessories.
Business couples were compared to Goop Gwynet Paltrow.
The director of this morning's show, 37, announced on Instagram that he was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby got mad at the Dragons Den Petra Jones show, since at the last moment she got out of their profitable business with a brand of lifestyle to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was “infuriated” when a gold girl on TV on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company's headquarters in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that due to her new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – there was no time left for her to dedicate her brand clothes and Truly's accessories.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwynet Paltrow brand and predicted to double its assets valued at GBP 11 million.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving the trademark of True, Jones fled from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source says: "Truly was far more important to Holly.
It would be her long-term future to survive the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely surprised all involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale.’
Experts believe that the departure of this morning show leader, who is among the most interesting links for banks in Britain, would cost the company several million because of large investments in products, from candles and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
Moreover, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were a good friend of ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Cappova in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as President.
In addition, Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host to ITV I’m A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the media's criticisms because of a comment that appears to some to be "unpresidency" and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his gruesome "newsman" voice:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He stressed that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting, and his first meeting in Singapore in June was marked by Trump as a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the meeting of the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the "response" of the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead of the US, they continue to impose sanctions that continue to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results – they stopped testing the missiles, helped free hostages and brought the after-mortem remnants of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this crowded theater, we have 200 people standing here,” said Trump and showed the crowd directly in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island, more than a hundred dead
For example, when eliminating the effects of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lomboka people were displaced, they did not declare natural disasters, which is the condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation was somewhat complicated,” said Sumbungov.
Save the Children consists of a team to travel to Pala, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel can help on the ground.
The Sotopu, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palau and determining whether international agencies will be allowed to help.
In view of the fact that the earthquakes in Indonesia are permanent, the state remains completely unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters have been built after the tsunami, but on the other hand, this is not common practice.
The apparent absence of a warning siren after the tsunamis in Palu was likely contributing to the loss of life, even though the warning was in force.
Travel between many Indonesian islands is also a challenge at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake, is sailing towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
President Yoko Widodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure ahead of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit is a problem for the Yoko administration in re-election next year.
Joko is also faced with the pressure of long-term tensions between cults in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and more than ten thousand were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim crowds fought on the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Look at this: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge win for a late equation against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool in 89 minutes before the defeat of Chelsea in the 1st English League.
Sturridge has been admitted to give Xherdan Shaqiri 25 meters good in front of Chelsea's goal in the absence of his 1-0 team.
He put the ball on his left and shot a shot at a remote door.
The arrow traveled high above the penal area towards the top right corner of the neck.
The ball finally came down through the gate of Kepe Arizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I just tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always pull it forward as much as I can, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn't think much anymore and just decided to shoot."
Chelsea led a 1-0 half-hour with the hit of Belgian player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this action, the blue attacker gave the fifth ball back to Mateu Kovacic and flown into Liverpool's half.
In the middle, he quickly gave up and ran ahead.
Then he gave it up through the defense and Hazard ran into the prison.
Hazard made a quick defense and shot his left foot against the remote door through the Liverpool gate of Alison Becker.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool will meet Naples, Italy, in the group part of the League of Champions.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of fatal victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, the State Accident Agency reported on Sunday morning.
The representative of Sotopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference that many people were affected by the Friday earthquake of 7,5 which triggered six-metre waves captured in the ruins of buildings.
The palace, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is surrounded by ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The police launched a murder investigation after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead this morning in Merseysid.
They found a 44-year-old with stab wounds at 7.55 in the Grayson Mews building on John Street Street and arrested a 32-year-old man for murder.
The police are calling on everyone in the area who saw or heard a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but I am calling all those who were near John Street Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious about getting in touch with us.
I also invite all, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on camera footage to contact us, because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman was the resident of Birkenhead, and they found the body inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the crime scene and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are taking place, and police officers are informing the women's owners.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one could enter or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he was speechless.
The residents were now told that it could take several hours before they could reenter.
The police heard how he explained to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
It goes on to say, "This is so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another one outside.
A number of policemen stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
All those who have any information request that they write to @MerPolCC call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and then enter the diary 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memory target of the "re-write history" dispute
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatically attached Puritanism.
However, Cromwell Society has identified Crick's proposal as "insanity" and "an attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the West Minister of Palace will become a target.”
The iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell did not either order or carry out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor from the previous century.
The brilliant presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell shows the 19th century's opinion and is part of a history of personality that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell’s many (maybe even later in the 19th century than today) are seen as the guardian of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely accurate presentation, it is the subject of continuous historical debate.
It is clear that the dispute in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognized individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time he was the Lord's protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Killing pig killed a Chinese farmer until death
After reporting local media, a Chinese pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in southwest China.
A man who was only identified by the name of “Yuan” was found dead with a cut artery and a blood cover near a pig market in the town of Liupanshu in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday at the South China Morning Post.
The pigmeat word is being prepared for the vaccination of pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
After reporting, she and her cousin were supposed to travel from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pighouse with a blood-goose.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig smeared the farmer until he died.
“Brother’s legs were bloody and desecrated,” the “Wu” cousin quoted in the magazine Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs were locked up so that they wouldn't attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine fever have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with a man suffering serious bodily injury.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a Valianian farmer by the tractor, but then the woman took off the animal.
After pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a “skinner”.
"We'd just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need a sufficient measure of respect," he said.
Southwestern USA due to the remains of Orcana Rosa comes heavy rain
According to predictions, Hurricane Rosa moves towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and the weak.
However, Rosa will bring floodwaters to the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rose has been operating at 137 km/h since Sunday from 5.00 in the morning after east time, and is 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, the low air pressure area is strengthened, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical humidity toward the north-west of the United States.
In parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture that will mix with the low air pressure area will create abundant rainfall in the wider southwest in the coming days.
Locally, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flooding and the possibility of land use in the desert.
Due to high tropical humidity, the amount of falls in some places will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in the parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, mainly above the largest part of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm falls are expected.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain.
It would be very unthinkable to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into small rivers, and storms will bring local winds and dust into the air.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring local rains to the southern coast of California.
Fallins above 12 mm are possible, which may result in a lower drop in floods and sloping roads.
This will be the first rain for the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical plains will begin to approach Arizona Saturday afternoon and Monday morning morning, and late Monday and Tuesday falls will spread.
A strong rain will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday, and it will also last Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations can occur in the United States, as the Arctic cools and tropical regions remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic temperature difference in the central US.
Between Canas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there are 20 different degrees.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to establish and expand again.
Most of the Central and Eastern US will enter the heat of October with temperatures around 27 °C from the region of Southern Plain to parts of the north-east.
In New York we could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good options for temperatures above the average east US in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched an interesting Thursday's testimony by Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman charged with a sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political path continued, as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday's transformation in the last minute: an agreement called by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week prosecution.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had been vindictive and tried to divorce her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burning testimony that he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people should see their testimony on Friday.
The company estimated average TV viewing of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television networks.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that provided testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network networks.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the number of viewers watching the program in offices.
To make it easier to play, the sight is similar to that of presenting a football game final or awarding the award of the American Film Academy.
Television Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, is leading in the production of a full-day hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
Second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million observers, reports Nielsen.
The interest was also high after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in Friday's drama.
Following a statement by the office of a moderate Republican that he would vote in favour of Kavanough, CNN and CBS filmed on Friday morning the protestors yelled at him when he tried to join the elevator in order to participate in the hearing of the Justice Committee.
In the course of the play, he took a few minutes to see what had captured CNN's television camera alive.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have power while many women are sick."
Flake said that his office had made a statement and added that he would say more at the committee's hearing and then the door was closed.
All television networks were also broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee voted on the surrender of Kavanaukh's nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, to which the minority party of Democrats called.
Flakea was partly convinced of this conversation with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decided because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of playing political games in Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her of criticising her plans for leaving the European Union of ‘playing political games’ with the British future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May's arrival at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In a further interview with her on the cover of the magazine, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit Plan and said that it was a proposal that Britain and the EU pay the customs duties of the other "totally absurd".
Shooting Waydea Sims: Police arrested Ditheon Simpson, a suspected LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a fateful shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player on the LSU team.
After reporting to the Baron Rouge police, 20-year-old Diteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for the murder of a second degree.
Officials posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that during the battle Sims lost his sunglasses.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB television reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police filed a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to his death.
Security is $350,000, the lawyer reports.
On Friday, an observer from the East Baton Rouge Parish district issued a previous report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The police are grateful to the special units for assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest for the refugees of the Louisian state police, the criminalist state police lab, the South University police and the residents of the area.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva team thanked the local authorities for their "care and search for rights".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-inch attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The previous season, on average, collected 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps at the game.
On Friday morning, coach LSU Will Wade told us that the team was "shrewd" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
"That's what worries you all the time," Wade said.
Vulcan ash storm in Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes that the Volcano Popocatepetl blows have reached the southern neighbours of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as activities in the crater were strengthened and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center has observed several cases of thunderstorms and earthquakes.
Pictures on social networks showed thin layers of ash covering windshields of cars in the vicinity of the main city of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-degree earthquake in September 2017 hit central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protestors who supported independence faced opposing police units and thousands of people joined a rival demonstration marking the first anniversary of a Catalan polarized vote on abortion.
A group of masked segregated supporters of separatism held by anti-police units surrounded them with eggs and metal paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there was also a fight, where policemen had to use pendants to stop the clashes.
The independence supporters, who have been calling for several hours “without forgetting, without forgiveness”, faced Protestants who support unity and shouted “Let’s live Spain!”
According to local media reports, fourteen people in protests have been injured more easily.
The year following the referendum of 1 October, which was marked illegal in Madrid and celebrated by the Catalan separatists, the tensions in the region that supports independence remain.
The majority of the voters voted for independence, although participation was low, as the anti-vacculation opponents were largely boycotting the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police in violent attacks tried to stop the vote at the polls in the region.
Groups supporting independence camped overnight in front of the polls to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another route.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents crying out of happiness because they could love it, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite significant, although the narrow wins in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties supporting independence have been difficult to maintain this year's initiative, as many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or are waiting in detention for trial because of their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on the phone in support of the police, explained that protests had fueled politics on both sides.
“Tension is rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidateing in European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men flying into the house by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested because they flew into a Londonderry house several times by car.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 19.30 a.m. after British summer.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building were damaged.
At some point, we're supposed to be shooting at the car with a gunshot.
With the hit of Mengaja, Livingston won with 1:0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston won
Livingston surprised Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach of the club from Ibrox.
The Dolly Menga's shot made a difference because Gary Holt's team was paralleled with the Hibernian team elsewhere.
Gerard's team thus lost the victory in the guests in this year's championship, and the following week, Hearts is waiting for them, leading on the ladder and behind which they are left at eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has increased his number of defeats in the division at six matches and coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted defeat.
Livingston offered options against direct guests
Holt's team should have been running a lot before the attack, because they caused a lot of problems with their direct Rangser.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he sent the ball through the door frame, and then Alan Lithgow hit the doorbell, and Craig Halkett shot through the goal with his head.
The guests left the game of the Rangers because they knew that guests could be dangerous when interrupting the attack.
And so they came to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Menga, who shot and beat from the middle of the prison space.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but the domestic defenses couldn't get through and Liam Kelly's doorman didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was exonerating Kelly's defense.
Allan McGregor's Rangers' doorman shot Scott Pittman with his foot, and Lithgow fired at the target from another lifeston break.
The proposals continued to come to Livingston's penal area, but the domestics refused all the attacks, two offenses – Halket's violation of Glenn Middleton's replacement and the hand-playing offence – and the judge didn't get bored.
Livingston’s “Excellent Presentation” – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Excellent show and result for Livingston.
All of them were fine and continue to exceed expectations in this way.
The style of the game and the rules have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holto must be credited with the merit of the way he woke up the team from his arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and well organized the defense, while Menga kept up with Connor Goldson and Joe Worall.
However, the rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under Gerrard's leadership, they are greatly lacking in these standards.
There was no shot at the goal – only once they successfully defeated the host defense – and this is some sort of alarm for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan was accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in the morning in Berlin, they prevailed in smiles and blue sky.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes about human rights, freedom of the press and the Turkish approach to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
He also expressed his opinion to hundreds of Protestants — many of whom were Kurds — who did not support Erdogan's government and condemned Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to greet him in the country.
The opposition protests reflect the disparity of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others despise as autocrats.
A road accident in Deptford: the biker was fatally injured in a car race
In London, the biker was fatally injured in the race in which the car was involved.
An accident occurred near a crossroad between Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road in Deptford in the southeast of the city at about 10.15 after British summer time.
The car driver stopped and the rescuers came, but the man died in the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred only a few months after the biker died in the race in which the driver ran away on the street of Children Street, about 1.5 km from the Saturday accident.
Police have made a statement that police officers are checking the identity of the man to be able to inform their families.
They set up roadblocks and redirected the bus lines and advised the motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured in the outpost
Six prison guards were injured in an outlaw in a strictly protected man prison, reports from the prison administration.
The riot broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. after British summer time and is still taking place.
Police officers from the "Tornado" unit have been called to provide for the escape, involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
Minor facial injuries were provided to the guards in the area alone.
A representative of the prison staff said: "We have called specially trained personnel to provide for the escape in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this and will perhaps be further behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June was reported to have been the manager of the prison ward because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October, they called the anti-police unit in prison to intervene in a severe riot in which the personnel attacked with billiard bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remaining energy of Orcana Rosa is destroying the way through the southwest of the desert and endangers the sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings before the sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa is supposed to get angry with Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be getting late on Monday with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression within 300 kilometres of Phoenix since 1950!
Orkan Katrina (1967) is a good 60 km from the Arizona border.’
The latest models of the national centre for hurricanes provide for 50 to 100 mm falls with individual rainfalls up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including Rockies and Great Basin, are expected to range from 25 to 50 mm of rainfall, individual rainfall may be up to 100 mm.
For areas outside the danger of sudden floods, the rain of Orcana Rosa may be a blessing because the region has been affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as the drought is currently taking place in the southwest.
“As indicated by the U.S. drought tracking centre, good 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The path of Orcana Rosa leads first to the land of the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the force of hurricane on Sunday morning at the highest wind speed 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm comes in contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
Land is expected to reach Mexico with the force of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
Falls in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great danger to flooding.
"From the Baja California peninsula to the northwestern Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with 250 mm of rainfall" were reported on the weather.com website.
Orkan Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in early hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and against South Utah until late night on Tuesday.
“The greatest danger we expect from Orcana Rosa or its remains is abundant rain in the Baja California peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the American southwest desert,” said the National Centre for Orcana.
These falls can lead to life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and the earth’s weather in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for the suspicion of attempted murder after they found 16-year-olds with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4.00 after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remained "stable".
17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, reports the Avona and Somerset police.
Cops are calling anyone who might have caught up on the phone to answer.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was “painful and angry” by a democratic party
“Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the impassioned and unheard of tactics of a democratic party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Mr Trump said that Kavanaugh had been “suffering and anger” by a democratic party in the process of his appointment.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention, in which he clearly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s charge that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
On Saturday, the president said that the day “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage”.
“Voice to appoint Judge Kavanaugh has been the voice to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service,” said a crowd of supporters in western Virginia.
The President spoke directly about the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the electoral participation of Republicans in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I am really trying to apply," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argues that democracy is on the mission of 'stopping and hindering'.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh was scheduled to take place by Friday at the latest, the advisor to the Republican Party told the CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami of hundreds of people killed, the number of victims is increasing
The authorities reported on Saturday that in the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people died, a number of large waves were taken along the coast.
More than a hundred people gathered on Friday at the beach festival in Pala, when six meters of waves struck the shore and led many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Cunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the tsunami was in danger yesterday, people stayed on the beach and didn’t escape immediately, so they became victims,” said a representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency Sotopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, everything down,” explained Nugroho and added that he traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
The photographs from the air published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, ruined and damaged bridges and bridges surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the sundials continued to search the coastal city.
In the area of 2.4 million people, they felt a kind of earthquake.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released in the Friday powerful earthquake was approximately 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb force in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow bay, is intended to increase the size of the tsunami.
He described the damage as “absolute” and said that several thousand houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
He explained that the victims and damage may be greater at the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area of Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroh has said, communications are completely broken and have no information from the area of Dongala.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” said the Red Cross statement and added that staff and volunteers go to affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency received numerous criticisms because it did not inform the public that it had harmed Paul’s tsunamis, but officials say the waves came right at the time of the release of the warning.
In an amateur video published on social networks, it is heard that men on the top of the floor yell at people on the street in the coming tsunamis.
In a few minutes the water wall ran along the shore and took the buildings and cars with it.
At Reuters, they couldn't confirm the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a failure of electricity, which has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
Authorities report that the army began sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport was opened only to provide aid and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims increased to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Doseb, the members of the World Vision from Dongala arrived safely in Pala, where the employees in the courtyard in front of their premises had set up a shelter from the ravages, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of desertification.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with a lot of experience were not allowed to come to the Pala.
In accordance with the Indonesian Regulations, cross-border financing, stocks and assistance of personnel shall be authorised only if the city is declared as a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is still treated as an accident at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘When the government says ‘all right, this is a national accident’, we can accept international aid, but it is not yet such a status.’
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing find their hope that their near miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble, and her mother’s body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a Indonesian sailor's coach, trained two missing sailors for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
The other, caught in the Roa Roa Hotel, were, according to Mr. Mandagiya, his students.
“As an elder in the field of nuclear decline, I bear my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in an hour when news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel circled around the community of sailors, in despair he sent messages in the WhatsApp app app to the contestants in Palu who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked only with one gray bell, instead of two blues.
“I think this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Dads stole 26.750 USD while filling ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, after reporting to the Newport police, Fathers stole $26,750 from the Brink’s security staff, who filled the ATM in Newport on the Leeve.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver the money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a statement to the public.
While he was employed, another man “approached the staff security service Brink’s from the back” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
After reporting, the Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of participants in the event.
All those who have information on the identity of suspects should call the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – in Ye.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: "Being with the official name Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has the name Ye for some time and has also used it for the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes right before his performance at Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new Yandhi album.
He will replace the song of Ariano grande, which has given up for “personal reasons”, by the performer.
The word is abbreviation of his current professional name, and West has already said that the word has religious significance for him.
“I think that “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means “you”,” West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the album title to the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you and I'm all.
Kanye, which means the only one, I have changed to Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are."
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire to name Love and Brother Love.
The former West's collaborator, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with thought or without him and with big letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President, Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military forces against civilians, just as the state is nearing the 50th anniversary of bloody violence on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza market that he would “never use armies to deter the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements began operating in Latin America, 300 people were shot and killed in peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans and to provide monthly grants to students and to open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education drew young people into criminal associations.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the resources it spends on research in this field, a real investor and expert on AI Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the American government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the United States does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in innovations in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Redoubled the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are quite for the United States and we are looking for the next passage in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the possibility that the next major achievements in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the US, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most visible companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranking American player Othello, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee said that he was familiar with the previous technological competitions of the American government, such as the competition in robotics organized by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and asked when the next one would find the next viewers.
Researchers in the U.S. have to work hard to get state support, Lee said.
“It’s not the Chinese who takes the best academics, but it’s the company,” Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have worked best in recent years at the university to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that the changes in immigration policy could help the US strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think we should offer a green card automatically to people with an artificial intelligence doctor,” he said.
The Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions, like the National Scientific Foundation and other government organisations are distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the American Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrow committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next Initiative of two billion USD.
National Scientific Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than USD 100 million per year in artificial intelligence research
In the meantime, American legislation that wanted to create the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonians will decide on a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted on a referendum to change the name of their countries into 'the Republic of North Macedonia'. This would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbour's name constitutes the right to their territory and has put a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, governments agreed on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but the boycott campaign expressed doubts that the participation would be at least 50% as long as it was necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum list was: ‘Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece?’
Speakers of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth joining with bodies such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the state and for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote that will be decided.
The amendment of the name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission has notified that no irregularities have been reported until 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to choose for my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje’s capital.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duška, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, gave their referendum votes in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the way to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliaments in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small ore and set up chairs in front of tents by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor state, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
The president of the Zaev government says that NATO membership will bring a strong investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after delivering his ballot.
He added that it would be a positive result of "confirming our future".
The poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that the referendum would take place between 30 and 43% of voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
The second survey carried out by the Macedonian television Telma showed that on Sunday, 57 percent of respondents would be chosen.
Of these, 70 percent would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, there must be a vote of 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government, which took over the mandate of May.
Look at this: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City played the entire Brighton defense and victory
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England played Brighton's defense at Manchester City with 2-0.
Aguere's hit in 65 minutes was seeming ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker took place at the start of the action, reported in the middle of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defense players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defense player and was faster than others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he gave Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in the prison, the English attacker returned the ball to Agueru, who with his right foot beat Brighton's doorman Mathew Ryan and sent the ball to the right-hand side of the net.
“Aguero faces foot problems,” coach Pep Guardiola told the reporter.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored the goal at that time.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the blue son the first advantage in the first English league.
The goal was achieved in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched the balls several times and then sent the ball to Sterling against the remote door.
The blue son's attacker pushed the ball into the net just before it flew over the goal.
The city will meet with Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and ruin their ability to address
The Nationals team has come out of the end, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always a competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to climb a metallic hill against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if Rockies still have the opportunity to play at the end, because in the Western League they have the advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
Rockies on Friday with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals team provided the least invitation to the organizer, but they are still waiting for their first title in the division.
"Even though we can't get anything, we can at least play in the excellent atmosphere before a great crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at the probably highest level this year.
So why don't you want to compete?"
Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metal for a week, but in this case it is likely to be metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, who is going to be the first metal 34 times, is on Thursday as a relaxing player and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
The Washington right-wing player collected 18 victories and 7 defeats with an average of 2.53 and 300 hit-outs in 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at the meetings in West Virginia
The President directly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electoral participation in the interim elections.
"All we've done will be on the cube in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I am really trying to apply, so I fight for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "We have this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats and it is happening now.
They are determined to take over once again, using all possible means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
According to his words, democracy is on the mission of 'stopping and hindering'.
“And you have seen this in the last four days,” he said and called the Democrats as “disgusting, evil, low and false”.
A member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, was nominated as a member, and a public hearing was given.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, wait. It was really a bad word of the body, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open for different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When an activist of the Momentum organization in my local party told me a non-confident, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who are not willing to express their opinion.
My colleague, Mrs. Joan Ryan, happened the same way because she firmly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, there was a suggestion of mistrust for my incompatibility with Jeremy Corby.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
In the Notice of Friday's Labour Party Meeting, Nottingham East said that ‘we want meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In eight years, as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday meetings were mostly exactly like this.
Unfortunately, in most of the meetings today, such a tone is not used, and the promise of a "friendlyr and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if it has ever started.
It is increasingly evident that different views in the Labour Party are not acceptable and that each opinion assesses whether this is acceptable for the Party's leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader, and the colleagues I had previously thought we were sharing similar political views were expected from me to change my opinion and adopt a position that I would never agree with – whether in the field of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak in public – and in fact it is not important what I say – they follow criticism on social networks that call for non-election, condemn the policy of the centre and tell me that they should not be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I have just made are just political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet daily with the flood of sexist or racist complaints, but they are not intimidated.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how the rates of abuse have become something quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with every proposal of distrust or amendment of the rules for the choice of a party is becoming more difficult.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice to keep my head down and not be so loud, but I'll be all right.
But I didn't get into politics because of that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student — the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which caused the teacher in my primary school to literally be destroyed — I have tried to become a local minister or minister for better public services for those most in need.
I've never hidden my political convictions, including the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East party could have been confused by my political views and areas that I did not agree with with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to spend time and energy discussing my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the state is plunging against a brexit that will affect the households, businesses and our public services.
But my true message is not about Nottingham Momentum, but about my voters and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud that I have served you, and I promise you that no threat to my non-election or political suitability will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Father 38:17 Melrose: Improper Father than Father's.
Two well-known experiments have distorted a few final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr won the victory in this wonderful fun first-day game.
Now they're at the top of the ladder and they're the only unbeatable team in the 10s.
At the end of the day, their top defenses and better use of the opportunity were translated into the home page and coach Peter Murchie had good reason for satisfaction.
“We have had many trials in our so-called games and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “The congratulations of Ayra’s team, the opportunities have been better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's hit at the 14th minute that Frazier Climo turned, Ayr took the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who was received in the Warriors, meant a number of powers for Melrose and Jason Baggott did a no-converting attempt.
Climo increased the leadership for Ayr at the crime scene, before he hit at half an hour and then converted a self-test for the result of 17:5 for Ayr at the time.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which he turned into Baggot, reduced the remainder to five points.
It was followed by a long interruption due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried on the carrier, and then Ayr made progress with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, which was transformed by Clima.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player with the unconverted attempt of Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of forceful pressure.
But the guests came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to block the ballless climate, MacPherson hit.
Climo reached the point after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing player in the fifth attempt of the hosts.
Still Game series star starting a new career in hospitality
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is apparently going to be the host of the hotel, otherwise he would become the director of a licensed company with restaurants.
The 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, which he also wrote about, played Jack Jarvis together with a long-standing partner in comedy Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that after the next ninth season, the last one, and it seems Kiernan's already planning life for Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, Arifingmorn Limited is the director of the company.
The player did not want to comment on the stories, but the source for the Scottish Sun pretended that Kiernan wanted to join the "flowering hospitality" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, the sailor's blue flags are out.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it."
In central Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – as well as the thirst for the natural seas around the Pacific.
This hope may now be the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be received after five years of consultations on 1 October.
"Bolivia has a beginning, a spirit of unity and impartiality, and of course in a positive spirit, it expects results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the decisions of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague Court will decide towards Bolivia, which argues that, after decades of inconstant talks, Chile must negotiate access to the sovereign access to the sea.
Here's Morales, the Bolivian charismatic national president, who is awaiting a controversial re-election battle next year, has also high expectations for Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court will not decide on Bolivia – and even if it would, it would not change much.
The United Nations Office at its headquarters in the Netherlands has not authorized Bolivia to grant Chilean territory and will not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is only six months after hearing the final arguments means that the case ‘was not complicated’,’ said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they haven't spoken to Bolivia, but they may have a lot to do with it.
“The current Bolivian government has used the question of access to the sea,” Zaratej said.
Morale's aggressive rhetoric from the Chileans has shaken all the good will that may have remained, explained it.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
They haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusual quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring 'an exceptional opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile' and the possibility of 'conclusion of 139 years of disagreements with each other', he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as a political defense.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he added.
‘Decision is an opportunity to anticipate that we must overcome the past.’
North Korea has stated that nuclear disarmament will not happen if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never destroy their nuclear weapons first if they couldn't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a talk at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil its commitments made at a meeting between the leaders of rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when US Minister Mike Pompeo appears to have reinitiated nuclear diplomacy, which was at the dead end more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the US is wrong if they think that the continuation of sanctions and the objection to the announcement of the end of the Korean war in North Korea will be fixed on their knees.
Washington is careful to support the announcement without first taking decisive action to disarm.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is a general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the withdrawal of the weapon that the state sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
In fashion magazines in Paris, discover the latest line of huge covers that come to stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to complete your cover collection or hide completely from the sun, you do not need to search further.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's designers have discovered a collection of wonderfully large covers in their collections for spring and summer 2019 on the fashion track, which blinded the story in Paris' fashion week.
This summer, very impractical cover was flooded by Instagram, and the designer sent their spectacular creations to the fashion track.
Valentine's piece, which came out the most, was a hat in a beige color with wide edges decorated with feathers similar additives in which the heads of models completely lost.
Other too big fashion accessories included shells with precious stones, magic hat and even pineapple – but your heads will not warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for the magic night.
Many colored masks have covered lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashion.
One creation was similar to the one with the fangs and glasses, and the other was seen as a cornea with ice-cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge cover will come to the shops near you.
Wide hats are closely followed by “La Bombi”, a broken hat with 60-centimeter ends, among others they observed Rihanni and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand for extremely impractical hats, which flooded the social network, sent another great creation – a strawbag for the beach, which was almost as big as the model in the baths it wore.
The raffia bag in burnt orange color, decorated with raffia cuts and with a white leather handle, was at the Parisian fashion the central piece of the La Riviera collection of Jacquemus for spring/summer 2019.
The columnist of the famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops for the next summer – because the designer made such a powerful impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many extras.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is key to global citizens
Scotland's independent schools enjoyed the fame of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results on the trials that further enhance individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS) are trying to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the city they have as global citizens.
As an education sector that can form and implement an adapted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in the language he understands, the conversation will impress him.
But if you speak to a man in his mother tongue, his words shall enter into his heart."
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results of recent examinations show that languages are at the top of the ladder with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
68 percent of students who learned that language have achieved excellent grades.
The data collected in 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72% of students achieved excellent grades in Mandarin and 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as an object of choice in the learning plans of independent schools and others are treated as objects in the fields of natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The research carried out by the Commission in 2014 for the employment and training of the United Kingdom showed that for reasons why employers are struggling to fill free jobs, 17% may be attributed to a lack of language knowledge.
Thus, knowledge of languages is becoming more and more urgent in preparing young people for their future career.
For future employment opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, he has a great advantage in the future, regardless of the career he chooses, with such life - giving knowledge.
A multilingual person who can agree directly with people from other countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 survey by YouGov, covering more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, with France being the only language spoken by the two-city percentage of respondents, that is 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have better opportunities to find suitable employment.
Schools in Scotland differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classic contemporary languages, while others teach languages that should be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest in independent schools, you will always be able to choose many languages that are taught by experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will equip and equip children with the knowledge they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be debiting on Lakers' dress in San Diego on Sunday.
For fans who enjoy LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, it will soon be over.
Coach Lakers' Luke Walton predicted that James would play a Sunday opening game against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
“More than one and less than 48,” explained Walton on the official website of the Lakers team.
The official rapporteur of the Lakers team Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the season.
“I don’t need a race before the season at this stage of my career in preparation,” he said.
Tromp meeting in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling in West Virginia starts a series of meetings in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five planned meetings next week, including its accessions to the country, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a seat in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened with a loss of control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia, and where can he be viewed online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. after east time.
The Trump meeting in West Virginia can be viewed live on the YouTube channel.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings of the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court this week, which has become tense over charges of sexual offence, which is why the Senate's confirmation is expected to be delayed for one week to conduct an investigation by the FBI.
However, the primary objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans who are expected to win a new start in November.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump of these five meetings, the aim was "to encourage volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
“Congression supervision is so important for its programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the tough season,” said a representative of Trump’s campaign to Reuters, who does not want to be nominated.
Today's meeting at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, which would attract the interest of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia the second time in the last month, in which he won more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public research.
“To Morrisey there is a bad sign that the president must come and ‘raise him up’ in public research,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, after Reuters report.
Ryderev Cup 2018: US team still wants to win and maintain hope before Sunday's individual fights
After three one-way games, the two foursomes may have been what the Ryder Cup this year needed.
A moving niche is a completely inventive sport concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where's the noose going now?
“They had six points of advantage, and now they have four, so this is probably a new start for us,” said Jordan Speith at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage because it leads by four points and 12 more can be achieved.
But according to Spiet’s words, the Americans feel that they have the wind in their sails, and among other things, they are encouraged by the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was doomed from the initial stroke to the vegetables and gave a good example.
The shouts of luck continued to become louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and two points were left to be compared in the fourth game.
The blow that won them at the 15th hole was a similar scream that lets you know that they believe the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to look for your inner power and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That's all these players are left now.
18 holes to glory.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of Ryder's cup.
The unusual but charming two Europeans have won four points out of four and are indispensable.
The two "Molliwood" were the only ones who didn't hit the buggy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided buggies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy flows obviously between them and the loud crowd confirm the fact that they are now the players who will have to beat them on Sunday, and no other player could better seal Europe's possible victories as Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun comes over the Le Golf National.
And if possible, both at the same time in different holes.
But it would be premature to talk about European fame.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Serge Garcia, a morning hero in a game with four balls, who was in a couple with Alex Noren.
Because of the bugs and two double bugs at the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish fell into a crisis from which they did not find a way out.
And on Saturday, the players won't get any help.
Games with four balls and twins of two are exceptionally interesting to follow from close because of communication between couples, advice they give, advice they don't give, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a great deal of advantage before the last day, but the two dubbings have shown that the U.S. team also has a wish for victory, which some, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 before Ryder's last day
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder's cup with a nice advantage after Saturday's games with four balls and double two waters with 10:6 towards the United States.
The excellent pair, composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, has done everything in his power and with two victories over Tiger Woods and has scored four points on Le Golf National.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to win the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltin, had in the morning games with four balls power over the American team that she had failed, and said in a row of 3:1.
The U.S. team was better fighting in the doubles, where they won two games, but the resurgence could not be compensated.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12th individual fights if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newspaper to win four consecutive points, while Molinary (a couple called Molliwood) won four points in his first four games in Ryder's history after the sensational weekend.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they turned out again and beat even more convincingly the spent Woods and American newspaper Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at moments, but lost 19 of the 29 games in a match with four balls and two doubles, of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning of the game with four balls, returned for the twins of two and in pair with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were ranked first and third on the world ladder.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwest part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the European team.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1, they firmly defeated Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in two, losing the first two holes.
Only once in Ryder's history did the team return after four points were left behind before the individual fights, although Fury's team only needs an equation to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in another place, the Sunday counterattack may seem to be too much for her.
North Korea: “Without trust we will never be disarmed unilaterally”
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions caused an increasing lack of confidence in the United States and that North Korea would certainly not give up its nuclear weapon unilaterally.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Authority, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had adopted a number of 'significant measures of good will' in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, supporting nuclear testing and promising not to expand nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see the appropriate response from the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the US, we will not be convinced of state security and under such conditions we will never be the first to disarm ourselves on a unilateral basis.”
While Ri reiterated the well-known complaints of North Korea regarding Washington’s resistance to the gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, within which North Korea would be rewarded for the adoption of the gradual measures, his statement was important because he did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pjonjang had done in the past.
Ri committed himself to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader, who took place in Singapore on 12 June. Kim then committed himself to "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea wants the official end of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pjonjang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not allow the call to release the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
“The United States insists that we first have to disarm nuclear weapons and step up the pressure with sanctions in order to achieve its objectives by force, and also even advocate the declaration of the end of the war,” said Ri.
"When you think that sanctions could put us on our knees, it's an unrealistic hope for people who don't know us at all.
However, the problem is that the continued implementation of sanctions further deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. President presented to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Ja Inom, which took place in the past five months, and added: "If we were to talk about nuclear disarmament with South Korea and not the US, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not agree to such a dead point."
Nevertheless, the tone of Rije's speech was quite different from that one last year when the United Nations General Assembly said that the attack on the U.S. territory with North Korean rockets was inevitable, after "Mr. evil president" Trump Kima called the "missile man" on the suicide mission.
This year Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the United Nations Assembly, but said he was still waiting for much work and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is nuclearly disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that this was not the expected time frame, and said: “It may take two years, three years or five months – this is not important.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue without exception until we recognise the complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament situation.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to disable the financing of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
The Pompeii met with Rij on the side of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pjonjang would visit again next month due to preparations for the second summit.
Pompeii visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that he had made progress, and North Korea had criticised him in a few hours if his demands were "gangster".
North Korea has committed itself, at the meeting with the Moon that took place this month, to the failure of the missile testing station and the nuclear testing infrastructure, provided that the United States adopts the appropriate measures.
Mr Kim should have said that the 'relevant measures' meant security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore and measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course to learn how to take enough time to rest
The aim of the new annual course at Harvard University is for all graduate students to learn how to get more sleep. They want to fight against the growing masculine culture of "celeonic" learning, in which the powers are accumulated with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s best universities often do not know the basis for caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that was based on his first species in the United States.
In order to implement such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, "Why do I know that now that I'm in my last year?"
She said no one told her how important her sleep was.
This year's course speaks of the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving the overall good feeling.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, says that they decided on such a course when they found that the student was significantly undernourished during the week.
The enournary course includes many interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of the student’s home where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports jackets and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deprivation on sports performances and the importance of sleeping routines.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression and cancer.
The student village map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health affects smoking cigarettes," adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present at “survived whole-night learning”. He also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, as a result of the lack of sleep, are increasing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that sufficient quality sleep should be the ‘hidden weapon’ of the students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This can also prevent weight gain – the brain from starving because of lack of sleep, which makes the students constantly hungry.
19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler to form a course. Last year he attended one professor's lecture at Harvard.
He says that his teaching opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student community.
It is hoped that, in the next phase, the undergraduate students will be able to ask to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students keep up with their sleep as well as with their confusion. He also wants to remind them of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’, which are provided by electronic screens and LED lighting, as they may cause imbalances in Circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with mattetka dipil upe Gerarrd's team
Rangers again defeated in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston announced Steven Gerrard's team sentenced to defeat by 1:0.
The team from Ibrox hunted her first victory after the February victory at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4 : 1, but Gary Holt's team beat her second in 18 matches since she was led by the Gerrard team, leaving his team for the leading team of the Scottish league behind 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the chosen type of Rangers didn't give the impression that she wanted to be equal.
The Rangers fell to a common place, and Livingston was progressing to a third place, but with a different goal, the Hibernian team remained.
Calum Spence, a party judge, suffered a head injury when, after reporting to him, an object arrived from the city of the cheerleaders' visiting team.
Gerrard, in a crew that beat Ayr without any difficulty and placed himself in the semifinals of Betfred Cup, made eight exchanges.
On the other hand, Holt was holding on to the proven Ensign of Livingstone, who took the point of the Hearts team a week earlier, and he was no doubt excited about how his affected team effectively neutralized all the guests' attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after Menga found Scott Pittman, who then went to Allan McGregor's goal, but the link was incorrect and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but the balls then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, Rangers took control, but the game more pointed to hope than the actual desire for victory.
Alfredo Morelos was quite sure that after a 15-minute match with Steven Lawless, a criminal shot should have been achieved, but Judge Steven Thomson had thrown Colombian demands into the pot.
In the first half of the year, the ranger managed to draw only two shots on the goal, but he didn't shoot with the head sent against the goal by Lassana Coulibaly, or Ovie Ejari's ball, they didn't pose any danger to Liam Kelly's doorman.
The 34-minute lead target of Livingstone may have surprised everything, but it has already been fully deserved because of its endurance.
The rankrs couldn't get another one of Jacob's long-term sequels.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi to give a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard took action and, during his vacation, Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent with a wing player, who immediately proved to be morelos, but Kelly effectively came out of his line and blocked the attack.
Still, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, while Lithgow and Halkett provided more for the goal.
Holt's team could have increased its leadership by the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was not accurate.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the option of a criminal shot after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not admit it.
Almanah: Geiger's Designer
We present a page from the Almanac of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, so today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger's head.
It became a stable in the scientific world, and it also gained its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950's film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's knife. It's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you turn on your headphones, you can actually hear the effect that radioactivity has on the atoms in the materials.’
Evans: "The Madonna, now they are really going to announce!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his birth on 63rd birthday.
An invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can be identified by the immune system
A new cancer vaccine can be identified and destroyed by the immune system
The vaccine in the course of therapy teaches the immune system to recognise the cells
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells in patients who have then changed to a laboratory
Thereafter, they may ‘see’ a protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer and then be returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine that the immune system learns to recognise the infectious cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells in patients who are converted to a laboratory to ‘view’ the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then re-injection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research at Bethesde, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘promots the growth of several different types of cancer’, including breast, ovaries, lungs and fat intestines.
A similar approach to the acquisition of immune cells in patients who are “learned” to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a protruder point with a maga inscription on the gate after the SNL performance.
The public was not thrilled
Kanye West was highlighted in the Saturday Night Live performance studio at a strange point, during which he expressed his support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would compete for the presidency.
After the end of his third performance, called "Ghost Town", during which he wore the hat with the title "Make America Great Again", West began an attack on the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I were to worry about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” she says.
This time the SNL show began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood player was born from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission accused Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue was not played, but it was uploaded to the social network by the comic Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to screw up from the West.
Among other things, the West complained to the public that he had some problems in the tank because of writing on the gate.
"They made me up to the stage.
They told me, "Don't go to the oven with this hat."
They put me on!
But they say I'm lost," he said after the Washington Examiner report.
West continued: “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and he added that he had to hope for “Superman’s fence because it means that nobody can tell me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
His comments were prepared by the public at least twice and the members of the SNL team were in obvious disrepute, and someone told Vanity: “The study was a death-killing silence.”
West was last invited to a goat exchange for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days before.
The West has caused much surprise with the video for the song "I Love It", where he wore a costume of the Perrier mineral water bottle.
West supported Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: thank you for being UPRL RAJI.”
However, Karen Hunter, the speaker of the talk, argued that the West is simply “what it is, and it’s all right.
However, I will NOT reward anyone (by purchasing his music, clothing or supporting his "art") who, in my opinion, greets and spreads the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and will from now on “being, formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE.”
He's not the first musician to decide to change his name, and before him, he's already done this to Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His roommate Snoop Dogg was once named Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to symbol, and then he was the Artist, once known as Prince.
A man accused of attempted murder for stabbing a person in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after being stabbed by a man in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident happened in Ballyhackamor.
The accused must report to the court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Star game chair Kit Harington has played hard against toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known after his match in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval fantasy series of the thrones.
A 31-year-old actor who strongly condemned the stereotype of a masquerade hero says that because of the appearance of such roles on screened young boys, they often feel that they can earn respect only by their hard work.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that in his opinion something went wrong, and wondered how to cope with the problem of male toxicity during the #JazTudi period.
A player who recently married a 31-year-old soybean from the Rose Leslie throne has admitted to having strong convictions about this subject.
“I am personally seriously wondering where we made the mistake when it came to manhood,” he said.
"What have we taught men during our growing years about the problems we are now facing?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing the toxicity of the male due to the display of very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What do we learn on television and on the streets that young boys feel that they have to choose this particular salary for men?
I think it's one of the important issues of our time, how can we change that?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong with young men.'
He also said in the interview that after the end of the series he would not take part in the recording of any precedent or continuation of the Game of the throne, because he was “completed with battlefields and horses”.
Kit will play in the main role of the new play of True West Sam Shepard, which is a story about a film producer and his brother a thief.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that happened because of the game of the throne was that he met his wife Rose on the tape.
“For this series I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte in a fantasy series, awarded with Emmy, a love choice of Kitt's character, Jon Snow.
The couple reported on the possession of Leslie's family in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In most new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which is a change compared to the past.
In some parts of China, HIV has usually spread rapidly as a result of a blood transfusion.
However, according to Chinese health officials, the number of people infected with HIV in the province of Junan fell to almost nothing.
Yet, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS continues to increase annually in China by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV with sexual intercourse is a very serious problem in the Chinese community of LGBT.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is still very high.
As conservative values are still in force in the country, 70 to 90% of men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to women.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate sexual protection in such conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government, as part of its efforts to solve the problem, has promised general access to medicines for the treatment of HIV.
Maxine Waters denies that the personnel have issued information about the Republican senators, condemns “dangerous lies” and “theorie of conspiracy”
On Saturday, the U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters rejected the allegations that a member of her staff had published information about three American republican senators on their website in Wikipedia.
The democracies from Los Angeles have claimed that these charges come from individuals and websites of the extreme right.
"False, lie and more unbreakable lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
Published information as indicated includes domestic addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
This information appeared online on Thursday, which was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill, during the Senate meeting on charges of sexual harassment of the candidate for the Supreme Judge, Brett Kanaugh.
Information was lost after the three senators had completed their hearing with Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicate that it is possible to identify a source of publication through IP address to be linked to Senator Waters' office and to conclude that information has been published by one of the staff, Hill reports.
“These unsubstantiated accusations are completely wrong and pure lies”, Watersov continues.
"My employees whose identity, personal data and security are threatened by these false accusations are not at all responsible for the processing of these data.
These unfounded accusations are completely false and pure lies."
Senator Waters' statement quickly came across criticism online, including by a former representative of the White House for the press, Aria Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote: “From this denial of rage,”
“This may mean that it is not from the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he hasn't done, he can't show his anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one he accused.
Stay calm.’
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too obviously angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters City in the interim elections, responded via Twitter.
"If that's true, it's serious," he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her cabinet had informed the relevant institutions and prosecution authorities about these false charges.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for tips on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and is also applicable to the revitalisation of Johnny English's action comedy, which came for the first time in 2003 with the title of Johnny English and the continuation of 2011 with the title of Johnny English 2.
Will the fun satire about how we hate, the new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English with bloated eyes and unusual grammaticals obtains permission to remix the eyebrows; already his name indicates that it is a comic character created for the cinematographic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is an NGO secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains part of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's corner and the smallness of the one who contributed the last note to the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
It is also based on the passenger and the international secret guard that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV advertisement for Barclaycard, leaving for himself real chaos.
The latest film presents one or two pleasant moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wore a medieval armor, and the rotor lists had a short time to deal with his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly displayed, but humor seems a little soft and unnecessary, especially because “serious” films like 007 or Mission cannot now offer comic elements without bad news.
It seems that humor is meant for children and not for adult viewers, so for me to say no to Johnny English's adventures are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's does not skim in Mr Bean's role.
The constant theme is now obvious that Britain is in serious trouble.
The Internet hacker has infiltrated the network of British most secret agents and revealed the identity of all British agents, causing major problems to the competent agent, represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is a point of break for the prime minister, a late figure who, because of his political impatience, has already experienced a crime: Emma Thompson has done his best to play the role of the alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing in the scenario that can help.
The Intelligence Service informs her that all active spies are exposed and must therefore decide for one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prestigious school, who teaches informally how to work under the cover: here are the screenwriters, because English is performing some kind of spy "academia rocka".
The English are taking them to Whitehall to an emergency meeting where they meet with a long-time colleague named Bough, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the commander of the submarine, a stereotype sports fan, a role that Vicki Pepperdine is losing a little bit.
So Batman and Robin are prepared to create more problems on behalf of the secret service of her Majesty, and they meet the fatal Ophelio Bulletin played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: this is the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their stay: dressed in a natakor a fire in the French restaurant, create chaos when you put yourself on the roof of the Voltian yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for apparent reality to get to know the interior of the Voltian house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite its sympathies and energy, it refers to a child film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films, I can't help myself here and think: is the British Atkinson able to play a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labourers deny that British are planning a four-day work week, with a pay for a five-day work week.
The Labour Party of Jeremiah Corby is thinking about a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive payment in five days.
The company leader party wants the savings generated by companies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence to flow to workers and provide them with an additional day off.
So employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with the same high pay.
The sources say that the idea is in line with the party's economic plan and with the plan to put the country on the side of the workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day work week, as it is a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review should be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-day worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve by the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported a four-day working week in its campaign in the 2017 general elections.
This objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party's policy and the party does not think about it."
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to extract the power of "respective directors" and "rewarders" in municipal companies.
The drawings of the chancellor in the shadow also mean that current water business participants may not regain their full share, as the Labour Party could, on the basis of alleged guilt, introduce ‘debts’.
It also confirmed plans for the inclusion of workers in the Management Boards and the introduction of the Ownership Inclusion Fund, which would transfer 10 percent of their share in private enterprises to employees who would receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed whether they could change their opinion of the Kavanaugh investigation conducted by the FBI.
The investigation of the charge against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises a question as to whether the findings of the office of any senator of the Republic could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview held Sunday, a letter from the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find anything that would change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
»Before the hearing I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this charge came up, I asked him, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, unmistakable, unquestionably."
But Graham's voice seems to be stuck in the rock.
“I created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change,” he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett strongly denied it, ” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those whom she named could confirm this.
The case is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens (Global Citizen Festival) and has contributed to reducing poverty anyway?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event with a truly exceptional type of stars and an equally exceptional mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will be meeting a lot of the Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to stimulate their interest in the real purpose of the event, namely the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international defence group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free entry for the event (unless you were willing to pay for the VIP entry), participants of the concert had to perform a variety of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, letter to the world leader, telephone call or any other meaningful way of raising awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
How, though, is the Global Citizen’s movement successful, which has remained 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with a free concert really a way to convince them to demand action, or is this just another example of so-called ‘klitivism’ – creating a belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or by sending a tweet?
Global Citizen's movement has indicated that since 2011, more than 19 million 'acts' of their supporters have been recorded in their efforts for a variety of objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to adopt commitments and policies worth more than USD 37 billion, which would affect lives by 2030.
By 2018, the Group indicated that the results of its actions were to be 390 commitments and messages on the basis of which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision makers committed to ‘help children realize their full potential’, which Rwanda promised 35 million USD to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets by Global Citizens.
“With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens such as you, the social guilt of undernourished can be shared in historical archives,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Food at the London concert in April 2018.
The Group also stated that the government, following more than 5000 actions, which the United Kingdom called for the improvement of food for mothers and children, announced that it would co-finance the Food Power project, which would reach 5 million women and children with food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, ‘Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?’,
the movement Global citizen replied: "This will be a long and hard path – sometimes we will fall and fall.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will also succeed, as we are stronger together.
Among some performers who will perform on this year's New York event are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to ‘block’ Russian energy exports – the US Ministry of the Interior
US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke should have said, after reporting the Washington Examiner magazine, that Washington could use the Navy to prevent the Russian energy market, inter alia in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian mediation in Syria (must be warned to invite the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that their presence in the Middle East is the reason for the desire to market energy, as it is being marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," he said.
However, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can fly this off. The Navy ensures that our maritime routes are open and blocked as necessary, preventing Russian energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke turned to participants in the event hosted by the Energy Union, a non-profit group addressed as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, and he warned that it was actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic potential is more or less affected by fuels and their substitution,” he said, marking Russia as “a pony who knows a single trick” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
Statements were made at a time when Trump's administration was trying to increase exports of its fluxed natural gas to Europe, where it would undermine Russia, which is a much more expensive choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the government of Trump, including US President Donald Trump themselves, are trying to convince Germany that it would give up the "inadvertent" gas pipeline project North Stream 2, which is supposed to be Moscow's "tall" after Trump Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth USD 11 billion, which is intended to double the existing gas water capacity by 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that this is unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same view that energy must not be a tool to implement pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow after September.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The involvement of a third country in our energy supply is a major problem for me," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "exactly examine" her candidacy for the US President's election in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was going to "research" her candidacy for an American president after the mid-term elections.
In the city house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about her candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman's leader," said Officer The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will study my candidacy for the President in detail."
Warren was building President Donald Trump at a meeting in the city house, because he was supposed to "lead this country in the wrong direction."
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy is very worrying,” she said.
Warren has criticised Trump and the candidate for the president of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh several times.
On Friday's tweet, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the elections."
The poll published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believe that Warren should not compete for the presidency in 2020.
According to a survey by the University's Political Research Centre in Suffolk/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for the president, eighty percent of the “probably” voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty percent would support her candidacy.
The survey has shown that the former Governor Deval Patrick has greater support for the candidacy, with 38% of the respondents to support it and 48% to oppose it.
The other high-level democracy that would take into account the candidate in the 2020 elections are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
After reporting to the Associated Press, Biden said he would take a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“When my own son survives what he experiences after his return, he connects me with other families who face post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain measure of injury that our soldiers are returning with”, he told the public at a meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The son’s arrest was marked as “an elephant in the salon” and said that her son and other military veterans were returning a few changed, hardened, wondering where respect for what soldiers and aircraftmen and all other members of the army were giving to the country.”
Track Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with violence in the family with an attack on a woman, an obstruction in reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons in a guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a police station representative in Wasilla.
18 federal states and the Colombian District support the rejection of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbian District support the legal rejection of a new American policy, which deprive victims of the right to asylum who flee from mob violence or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the area mentioned had completed the trial on Friday in order to support the legal objection to the policy.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions' case, filed by the American Union for Civil Liberties against Federal Policy, has not been published.
She said that her partner and “his violent sons, members of the crowd”, abused her, but on 20 July the American authorities rejected her asylum claim.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the states that support Grace, Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications are made in the United States, have described themselves as countries that constantly face problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy annulled the decision of the Immigration Appeals Committee, which enabled unregistered immigrants fleeing violence in the family to apply for asylum.
The State Prosecutor of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "respects the decade of state, federal and international law."
‘The national law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application and that such a prohibition violates this principle’, states the request submitted to the Court.
State prosecutors further stated, on request, that a policy that denies immigrants the right of entry would harm the American economy, as they were likely to become entrepreneurs and to "supply the necessary workforce".
The Attorney General of the State, Jeff Sessions, ordered the immigration judges not to grant asylum in June to victims fleeing from domestic violence and mob violence.
‘Azil is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion’, said Sessions on 11 June in their policy publication.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems people face every day throughout the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but there are desperate attempts to rescue them
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum, when she comforted her hot boy in the evacuation center in the scattered town of Pala.
"The rescuers continually import bodies.
It lacks clean water.’
It seems that the townspeople were returning to destroyed homes that were inundated with overcrowded things and were trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that were destroyed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the victims, including Two Haris, who suffered back and shoulder injury, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated freely due to continuous severe shocks.
When he recalled a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was living with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I was being pressured against the ruins of the wall," Harris told the agency Associated Press. He added that he and his family were in town for the reason of the wedding.
"I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “supplying” with “propaganda ads”
One week after the publication of a four-year announcement of the official Chinese newspaper in the American Journal, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador to China accused the U.S. press of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week mentioned the paid addition of officer China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after China accused interference in the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November, which China denied.
The agency Reuters reported that US federal officials accused Trump of trying to interfere with US federal elections described as a new phase in Washington's ever-intensification efforts to pressure China.
Although advertising to promote trade is common to foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an ever-intensification trade war in which they exchange punches by introducing customs to import products.
China's rates of return at the start of the trade war should be affected by exporters in federal countries, such as Iowa, which are supporting the Trump Republican Party, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former Governor Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the Sunday edition of the Official Des Moines Register, "now this urgency doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
“In the expansion of the propaganda, the Chinese government has used the American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions in the Beijing newspapers and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have on the worrying Chinese economic path, because the municipalities are strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese magazines rejected the offer for publication” of his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans lose elections before inter-elections with a break with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh will be known in the upcoming interim elections, despite more allegations of sexual assault.
Feelings are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell University Faculty of Syracuse for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last moment would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget that either tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national representative of the progress group MoveOn, on Friday, following an official report from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang "November is coming!" when they demonstrated in the Senate hall when Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the news portal Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will go beyond all the borders," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-national political analyst.
"People say they're already strong, and that holds it.
But it could be even more powerful, especially between undefined elections in suburban and smaller voters from 18 to 29 years of age who do not like the President, but do not often."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she described in detail her allegations of the sexual assault of the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that further Republican support could have a negative effect.
“This has become a major confusion for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, after reporting to NBC News at the beginning of the previous week.
“It is not only about the vote of the world or the final vote or the Kavanaugh vow; it is also about the way Republicans accept Republicans and how they treated Fordovo,” said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA Group, who supports Democrats in the elections.
But the Americans seem to be a few divided between whether to believe in the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a few more supporting the latter.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or most likely to believe in Ford's testimony, and 35 percent have said that they are sure or most likely to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent were said to believe that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying during the witness, and only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The FBA is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported.
Ford's testimony was that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, attacked her in a guilty state last week before the Senate.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her the sex when they were together at the party, during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the world's web is planning to start a new internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the world web, is opening a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is the company that builds on Berners' open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of Inrupt was "to dominate the world".
“We decided to do this now,” he said about the new company.
"It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology that allows the user to create a ‘personal storage store’ or a POD
This may include contact information, mailing lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal data storage repository is that the user can fully determine who can access the information.
The company refers to this as ‘personal data laundering’.
Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of a company pooling resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow for access to the Solid platform for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few hired developers for project work and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they could introduce a complete change that could destroy all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a Saturday publication on the Medium Portal, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's intention was "to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new web, built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the internet with the establishment of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.

Bernard Vann: A celebration of the bearer of the 1st World War of the Victorian Cross
In the home city, they have celebrated the bestowal of the Victorian Cross for 100 years to the only Church of England priest he has acquired as a fighter in the first world war.
Colonel Bernard Vann earned his confession on September 29, 1918, in an attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was shot by a gunman, so he never realized that he had been given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two grandsons discovered a monumental stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act with which he served his award.
After reporting officer London Gazette, Colonel Vann, on September 29, 1918, led his battalion through the Canal of St. Quintin "toss a very frequent fog and under the strong fire of the battlefield and machinery."
Later, he planned against the line and with the "most heroism" he led the line, and then the mechanic himself attacked and beat three members of the squad.
Colonel Vanna shot a German gunman on 4 October 2018 – only a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the old father's actions were "something I know and I could never achieve, so he taught me humility."
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, they also laid a wedding after the parade of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this paradise” and “that the courage of the true hero is reflected in the support expressed by many people.”
Inspiring over mixed martial arts, they ran all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they were part of Puyse Pepe.
Imagine: You spent all night watching the completely sold Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The incident in San Jose involved 13 fights, including the sixth on the main parquet, and was carried alive on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to take over, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised to find that the transmission had been replaced by the play of the drawing by Puys Pep.
Many were not very excited because he stayed awake until morning because of the fight.
One of the fans described a child drawing switch on Twitter as "some kind of painful joke".
‘In accordance with the Government Regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children’s programme,’ said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication when asked about the transfer.
"Peppa's pup."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule so that future viewers in the United Kingdom would also be included.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could fix it,” Coker said.
"But then there is six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a number of messages were exchanged during the breakup and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix the case; we assumed it was just a technical mistake.
However, the real reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of the six, we will carry five duels — as usual. We have tried to offer worshipers more than expectations, and we have taken note of this.
This is a very ungrateful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "deprived" about sex.
Olympian diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt inferior to everyone – but it gave him motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said he knew that “not everyone like him” knew when he entered high school.
Speaking in the first play of Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4 radio, he said he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he reduced his desire to win the Olympics.
The regular director of a long-standing show, Kirsty Young, was absent due to a multi-month illness.
Daley, who appeared as an exile in Laverne's first performance, said he felt “less valuable” than everyone else, because “it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls.”
He said, "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity are a real thing that gives me the strength and endurance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that it was “something, ” he said, that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally know about his direction.
Twice the bronze Olympic champion became an influential defender of LGBT rights and appeared twice this year at the Games of the Community of Nations in Australia to invite countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he was happy to be able to speak openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said that the novelist with the man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – was "precedented."
Daley reported last year with the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, but said the difference in years never meant any trouble.
“When you’re so young” – at the age of 14, he attended the first Olympic games, and three years later his father died – said, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar climbs and falls.
A couple of June adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says that this changed his "whole look".
“If you asked me last year, it would be all I had to say that “I need to reach a gold medal”,” he said.
“However, you know, there are more things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had entry tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and even when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally had to admit he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – drowning in the Olympic games before the home community. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first selection of songs – the stream of music by Heather Small, who followed him in the preparations for the Olympics and with which his skin is still attached.
Desert Island Discs play at BBC Radio 4 every week at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson's Saturday Ryder's cup of coffee
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder's Cup, but he will have to go back in shape so that this won't become an unfortunate borderline.
Mickelson, who will participate in the two-year event on record 12 times, has left Captain Furik sitting at the Saturdays.
Instead of being at the heart of the event, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time winner spent part of the day as a fan and part in improving his game in order to correct what was going on.
Given that even at the top of the career, the 48-year-old does not match the best narrow Le Golf National playground, where the long ice is inevitably punishing missing hits.
And if only the playground wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will have a deal with the exact winner of the British Open Francescom Molinary in the ninth match this week, which was linked to the news of Tommy Fleetwood in the run-up to all four games this week.
If the Americans who have four games at the start of the 12 individual games were to start well, the Mickelson game could prove decisive.
Furik expressed his confidence in his man, but he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, he hit me in the back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
"There's a lot of confidence in you.
He is one of the most famous and in the past, and this week he has also made an outstanding contribution to the teams.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's how it went and we thought it should be done.
He wants to play, just like everyone."
Mickelson will play Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Fury said his presence on the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to be fooled by people and he's great at having him in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun when they moved in with him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives a lot more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a high priority can soon be achieved
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage can be easily turned into an unpleasant ride at the start of the last day of the games of the Ryders.
Young Danec debuted in 1997 in the Valderram game, where the side of which the captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points of priority in front of the Americans, but through the goal she only crossed with the advantage of hair, with a result of 141⁄2-131.2.
“Don’t forget that we had a lot of advantage in Valderram; we had a lot of advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but hardly,” said Bjorn (in pictures) from the view of the Class of 2018 team who won from 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and told the game Le Golf National said 10-6.
So the story to me and everyone on the team shows that it's not over yet.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
It's not over until it says so on the table.
We aim to conquer this pot, and we must remain focused on it.
He has always said that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we are also well aware of who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Incentive to the game of his players on the required playground, Bjorn added: "There would never be a hurry.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
There will be an individual game in front of tomorrow, so this will have to be done differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, your golfers' abilities are tested to the end.
This is the message you have to convey to the player: Tomorrow you have to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind and he must get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furik will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who achieved three points out of four.
Furik himself was already on both sides of the conversions in the last day, as he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn before he finished as a winner when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every fucking word,” he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, told his players on the last day of the game.
"We have 12 major games tomorrow, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this drive gets endurance, strong pressure on the middle games.
We created an appropriate setting and put the boys in a way that we felt we were going to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try and fight with Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, and other Europeans will be in the upper half of the order.
“In this group of boys, I decided to take this order because I think it covers the whole schedule,” Bjorn said about the selection of individuals.
New German military ship rescheduled
The latest frigate of German Navy should be committed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War, but local municipalities reported due to system failures and rapid increase in costs by at least the following year.
The transfer of the ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leader of the new class of Fregate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now transferred to the first half of 2019, says officer Die Zeit, who mentions the military representative.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project raises concerns about delivery.
Four boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned in 2007, will replace the older class of the Bremen class.
It is expected that they will have a strong gun, a type of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some cover technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer distances between maintenance – the latest frigates should be allowed to stay outside the home port for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that the top warships to allow Germany to influence also overseas by force will have become obsolete by the time of its use, says Officer Die Ziet.
An unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
At that time, for the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
For reasons of return, only a few are known, and the German municipalities have identified a number of key ‘programme and technical deficiencies’ which would render the warship useless if directed to a combat mission.
The lack of software has been particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will run a crew of approximately 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older Bremen class.
It has also proved to be a heavy burden on the ship, reducing its capacity and limiting the marine capacity for its future upgrade.
The 7000-ton ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ was to be twice as heavy as the ships of the similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project has also become a problem, including training the crew.
This is expected to reach EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) – starting at EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is diminishing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy actually "is missing ships suitable for navigation".
The official said that the matter had become increasingly urgent over time because the old ships had been demolished and the replacement vessels had not been provided.
He complained that no boat of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund Listens to the Hidden Life of Netopires
A new research is being carried out at the holding in the Scottish Highlands, where they try to discover how bats use food when hunting for food.
They hope that the results will re-enlighten the behaviour of these unique refugees and help direct future conservation activities.
In the research, scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and small bats and brown bats and circular bats on Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
Special tape recorders will be placed at key sites to monitor the activity of bats throughout the entire season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of the netopy calls and what kind of actions they are doing.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their conduct throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of lawns and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined sharply in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting shelters and habitat losses.
The risks are also wind turbines and lighting, as well as mussels and some types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
But because of nighttime hunting habits, they help themselves to hunt prey more with ears than with eyes.
For precise identification of errors and obstacles on the road, a refined echolocation technique shall be used.
The NTS, which is responsible for providing more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land per country, is taking netopire very seriously.
He employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, shelter checks and occasional rescue.
The organisation is owned by Thrave in the area of Dumfries and Galloway even the first and for now the only Scottish reserve, specifically designed for bats.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says the property is an ideal territory for them.
“We have an excellent area for bats on Thrava,” he said.
»We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the quality habitat.
However, it is still well known about bats, so the work we are doing here and in other possessions will help us to understand better what they need to succeed."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out the maintenance work on holdings, as the possible accidental destruction of the same birthplace of bats could cause death to up to 400 females and infants, which could mean the loss of the entire local population.
The bats are protected and therefore they are prohibited from killing, harassing or disrupting, as well as from destroying their newborns.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Head of the Netopy Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and we simply don't know how well their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and lawyers prepare for the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape that he was supposed to commit as “false news” and said that people want to “promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing for the German magazine's prosecution with the news of Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
In 2009, the attackers of Portugal and Juventus accused an American named Kathryn Mayorg of strengthening the hotel room in Las Vegas.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was supposed to pay her $375.000 for the silence of the event.
In an interview with 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, marked the report as "false news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said is false news," said a gold ball winner in the camera five times.
"By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I am a happy man and I want everything well," the player smiled.
Ronald's lawyers, after reporting to Reuters, prepare for the Der Spiegel case for the charges they called "an unacceptable report on private life doubts".
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for “indemnity damage in amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident was scheduled to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
In the documentation submitted to the District Court of Clark in Nevada, she was to return to the player's room after meeting at the Mayorg Night Club with Ronald, and she was to strengthen her analytics there.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after that event and told her that he was a “99% good man” who only disappoints in “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed sexual relations, but described it as an agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police and that photos of her injuries were recorded in the hospital, and later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was “fearful of revenge” and was concerned with “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims that she wants to cancel the settlement because she is still suffering a severe trauma because of the alleged event.
Ronaldo was just before his transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer, after an agreement worth $100 million, he moved to the Italian great Juventus.
Brexit: United Kingdom would ‘suffer forever’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom ‘would regret it forever’ if it had lost the leading world car manufacturer’s status after the Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was ‘anxious’ that Toyota UK told the BBC that Britain's exit from the EU would temporarily stop production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby without agreement.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of brexite without agreement could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyotina model Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that in case Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement at the end of March, production in our factory stopped,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyot’s Managing Director at Burnaston factory.
Concerns about how the EU's outflow will affect cross-border trade have also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW has said that after Brexit, she will close her mini factory in Oxford in a month.
The main considerations relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of brexite.
Toyotin’s production line operates according to the principle of ‘at the right time’, with parts of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for cars on order arrive every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom did not come out of the EU on 29 March without an agreement, this could cause a disturbance on the borders for which panel representatives say they could cause a stop and a lack of parts.
Toyota in her factory in Derbyshire could not be coordinated for more than one day of work, company representatives said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Therese May's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly measured to avoid such border checks".
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will enable us, as I say, not only to enjoy the present success, but to seize this opportunity," he told Today BBC Radio 4.
"The data not only toyote, but also other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not comment on how long production would have been stopped and warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the United Union Union at the factory, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "After my experience the lost job never returns."
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could ‘present another week’, according to the White House on Sunday, due to the ongoing fight against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who examines Russian pre-election interference, the connections between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the potential interference of the President of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Attorney General's envoy and thereby threaten Mueller's independence is driving Washington speeches for several months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about the use of a hearing system for recording talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the President on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, in the middle of a report of his intention to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then announced at the United Nations conference in New York on Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein 'would rather not forgive' and then moved the meeting to avoid the conflict with the hearing of the senate's judicial committee, in which they witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct, Dr. Fordov.
On Friday, Trump determined a one-week investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet fixed for him. This week could happen, depending on everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, and could be postponed for another week.
We'll see. I'm always glad to see that you're informed."
Some of the rapporteurs would argue, Sanders didn't call the White House meeting with reporters since September 10.
The director of the show Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the frequency of meetings could not be attributed to the resistance to "setting up" TV reporters, but she said, "You can't deny that they're putting up."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President holds more press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding without mentioning the source: "We looked at the numbers."
The meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "But if journalists can turn to the President of the United States with their question directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to make this possible, and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared casually and partially bizarrely in front of the assembled journalists.
Letter from the EU Health Minister to NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the State and to wish to continue the work on the Brexit.
Jean Freeman, SME, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applying to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued during the summer, when the decision was taken this fall.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparation for the possible scenario of the outcome without an agreement.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member regardless of his nationality.
Friends from all over the European Union and non-member countries provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
You can feel at home in Scotland. We want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie emergency surgery after head injury
The liner of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, reported to Mike Organ from The Tennesseen magazine, after head injury in a Saturday defeat at 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team.
The chief coach of the Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury occurred only a half an hour ago.
“He came to the edge of the playground and somehow collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel provided Abercrombie on the edge of the playground with oxygen before being placed on the carrier and taken from the playground for further inspection.
The official from the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie recovered after the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘the nature of the injury is not yet known’ and that the Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a brewer at the university, plays for the Tennessee State University for the first time since the transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five hits together before he left the game, and his total number of hits in the season increased to 18 hits.
A higher tax will be charged to foreign buyers when purchasing real estate in the United Kingdom
A higher tax will be charged to foreign buyers when purchasing real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralise Corby's success to attract young voters
Increased amount will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The treasurer expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year, and she's going to use them to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher amount of property in the United Kingdom, and the money collected will be spent on homeless people, there will be a message from Theresa May today.
The move needs to be understood as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure more affordable housing and to increase tax on people with high incomes.
The increased amount will be charged to persons and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom and will encourage the government's efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The yield – which will be charged in addition to the current amount, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and real estate for delivery – could be at least three percent.
The Foundation expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
According to estimates, U.K. non-States were expected to buy 13 percent of newly built London property, resulting in higher prices and a heavier purchase of the first property.
Many rich areas of the state – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” as the number of customers who spend most of their time outside the country is increasing.
The new policy was adopted just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
A large construction company accused of increasing prices by robbing a country that did not actually use it, but Mrs. Mayevo called on to abandon the quotas for affordable housing in order to repair the British "commodity shame".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rentals and the completion of forced evictions without errors.
In addition, he wants to empower the city council to build new homes.
Ms. Mayeva said: “Last year, I said that I would devote my prime management to restoring British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means repairing our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
It cannot be true, however, that for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, the purchase of homes is as simple as for British citizens.
For too many people dreams of their own home are all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to run the Scotland Club"
Chief Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is once to become the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the North-East Club, which currently holds the third place in the First League, with three points less than the first.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer, after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship in the last season.
"For my country, I wanted to play as an actor.
I got a B cap and that's what Ross told me about BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
I would only be offered this opportunity if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former team leader Allo Athletic, who had previously rejected the Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers, says that as an heir of such great names he was not afraid.
“Success is measured for me by the question “Can I take this club back to the First League?”
In view of the structure and capacity of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the First League," he said.
"The way to it is not easy, but it would probably be a success only if the club could take it back."
Ross is doing the manager's work only three years after he was assistant manager in Dumbarton and 15 months of training staff of Hearts.
Alloi then helped to prevent the third league failure, and St Mirren led from the edge of the match to the title of the championship champion in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real breakthrough,” he mentioned taking Alloe.
“I was really sure that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because it worked out well for me as a player, so I survived pretty well, and I also achieved some more success.
But the game can become demanding.
We have to deal with a lot of things every week.
In terms of stress and pressure at work, I still face this, but management just feels like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to run a club and now I'm doing this. In my skin I feel the most comfortable in my adult life now."

Result of the study: the perfect beer time is Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat has increased the revenues of heavily breaking British pubs, but the pressure on the chains of restaurants has also increased.
In July, groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business adviser, who prepared the data, said: "The sustained solar time and England's participation in the world stock, which lasted longer than expected, meant that in July he followed a pattern similar to that of June in the previous month, when pub income increased by 2.8 percent, only that restaurants were affected even more strongly.
The fall in traffic in restaurants by 1.8% in June has increased further in July.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks has increased in comparison with each other more than traffic in restaurants has decreased.
As a result of the sun's weather, sales in pubs that mainly offer food have also declined, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6% in one month and the sale of food decreased by three percent.’
Paul Newman of the group of analysts for leisure and hospitality RSM said: “These results continue to be a trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The sale of hospitality remains the biggest factor in the time and impact of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the fall of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful at the level of the year due to constant cost pressures.
For local food owners in the long, hot summer, it would not be possible to come at a more irregular time and will only tell if recovery will be necessary to bring the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August."
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, indicating the slow introduction of trademarks.

One of the five children on the social network has a secret account he hides from his parents
The research has shown that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — has a secret account on the social network hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of false Instagram pages
News reinforces the fear of publishing sex-related content
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a "main" account for their parents
One of the five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - is on social networks to create an account that is hidden from parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of false Instagram accounts.
The news reinforced the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of pupils said they manage the censored “main” account shown to parents and also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally ran into a 13-year-old daughter's secret page, noticed that her daughter was inviting visitors to strengthen her.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) showed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, of which half are recognised as having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tempted to create a web site where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elidh Doyle will be "vote athletes" on the Scottish Sports Committee
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Sports Committee as an incomplete director of the annual General Assembly of the Administrative Committee.
Doyle is the most outstanding Scottish athlete in the field and free, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who are directing sports to take advantage of its extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities. We are convinced that athletes in Scotland would get hugely involved in the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be able to act as an athlete's voice, and I hope I can really contribute and help with sports in Scotland."
The American , who has won from the total of four Olympic medals in the course of 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator to BBC, has lost the ability to speak after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago I got hit by a drop.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said he'd only tell me if I could recover to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I exercise for agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
An advertisement for a breast pump comparing the mother to the cows has distributed online opinions
The company producing the breast pumps divided the opinions with an ad comparing the mother with the cows in the mill.
In order to start marketing ‘the first silent portable breast pump’, the consumer technology company Elvie published a provocative music video ad to show mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four true mothers dance in the society of cows in the mud, filled with sand, on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I draw, but there is no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these aren’t my tits, these are my tits.”
The collection continues: "Excuse, excite, feed the baby, excite, excite, squeeze the breast."
But an ad that was published on Facebook’s website has caused considerable negligence on the Internet.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it was a joke to the milk industry.
‘The use of cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they're pregnant and milking to produce milk, but they're being stolen by kids in the first days after the wedding," wrote one.

The second commented: "Of course it is traumatic for both mother and young man.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added, "Audience completely without feeling."
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she thought it was a song "to make a joke".
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it too if I still had a baby.
When I was pulling, I felt just like a cow.
The ad is a few crazy, but I understood it, just as it was meant to be.
It's a brilliant product," wrote another.
Someone commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who use milk (commonly at work or at the toilet) and feel like cows."
This is not an ad which would praise or condemn the milk industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing with hidden pumps in the swamp.
The concept of action is that many women who suck their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump pump is completely quiet, has no wire or tube and is discreetly attached to the breast-feeder, allowing women to move, hold the child and even play free during milk pumping.
Ana Balarin, a mate and ECD in mothers, further commented. “Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
With the movement of comparison between women who are milking, and cows who are milking, we wanted to put the milking of milk and all its challenges into the heat, and in the fun way in which women can connect, show an incredible sense of freedom that a new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump came to the headlines.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children walked the model path for the designer Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly moved to the tent camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained migrants has risen sharply, even though the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand the child over to sponsors.
The traditional majority of the sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to risk their own chances of staying in the country with the child's request.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to issue fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Agency, witnessed before the Congress that the agency had arrested more than ten people who requested the sponsorship of young people without membership.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or home sponsors are illegal in the country, and most of them are punished foreigners.
That is why we continue to look for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to address children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained and not after 60 days, as was the previous standard, said workers in the sanctuary.
Many will appear with a videoconferencing call, not in person, to defend themselves before the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts following statements of workers in shelters and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
Protesters have said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornill, where the signs of child pressure due to their size are more likely to remain undetected.
They added that moving children to the tent place without being emotionally prepared or given an opportunity to speak to friends may complicate the trauma that many of them face.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech from the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Mouale called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though war had been taking place in the country for eight years.
Moual, who is also acting as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the control of the fight against terrorism, and that "they will also act accordingly".
“They must quickly and unconditionally withdraw,” he said to the congregation.
Moualem said that “war against terrorism” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, “almost finished”.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
In Syria, the United Nations has some 2,000 soldiers who primarily train and advise the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Basar Al Asad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory and in the war-torn state.
With regard to the refugees, Mouale said that the conditions for them were suitable for return, and he charged ‘some Western countries’ with ‘spreading unreasonable fears’ which convinced refugees to stay abroad.
“The international community and humanitarian organisations have been invited to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
"They are changing into a political issue, which should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria not to receive renewable resources until Asad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a Tampon zone in the last major rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that he had a ‘clear deadline’ agreement and expressed hope that the military mediation would be directed against the jihadists, including combatants from Fronta Nusra, associated with Al-Qaida, who were ‘to be rooted’.
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to prepare a military constitution for Syria and press the way to the elections.
Mouale defined the conditions of the Syrian Government for its cooperation in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited to ‘the review of the articles of the current constitution’ and warned of interference.
Why Trump will reach another mandate
Following this conclusion, Mr Trump will win in the 2020 re-elections unless, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, his presidency will soon end with interpellation and scandal.
Which would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the Presidency at any time!"
For now, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s visibility has been more than doubled to 1.05 million at the time of the largest sighting, while MSNBC’s visibility has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time, which is more than four years ago after Nielsen had them at 1.7 million, and the Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC channel has reached the largest number of cable receivers with 3.5 million viewers on the night of important news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the “Designated Survivor” drama, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comic book and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few solid truths about the singing at the Hollywood Boys Club", offers a different explanation.
A taxi ride in Boston prior to the 2016 elections is recalled.
The driver told her he was going to love Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what appears on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of the case of Roe versus Wad, depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
It's a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, a six-hour look at a round table of experts discussing the use of the source “from deep background” for the book “Strah” Bob Woodward, 15,000 USD worth of new leather jackets (“wear, thickly supported with a boost”, said The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Trump, khm, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria again.
“A part of his start, which gives the impression of real performance, is that every night he offers something,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars show about the performance of Trump’s show and daily performances (double with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong Una).

When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 80 degrees (26.7 °C) outside his home on the northern coast of Kauji, but he was confused inside when watching MSNBC when he shot CNN.
There was no way that Brett Kavanaugh could escape, even when he faced a senate committee and suspended the future of the Supreme Court in the air.
“I remember when we created all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money is available in preparation for the narrowest interim parliamentary elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district, two candidates were in the race for the same seat due to the redeployment of the congress districts.
This recently to the newly divided suburban district of Pittsburgh was the home of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily covered with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawed when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of January ruled that the old districts were unlawfully painted for the benefit of the Republicans.
Only in the new 17th district has the colour for financing the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC) been touched.
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely monitored March special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to democrats.
In the U.S., they thought about sanctions against Salvador for China's support, and then they withdrew.
The diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners had rejected the leadership of the Trump organization.
Officials of the Foreign Ministry have decided to withdraw from the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama the “recent decision to stop Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, Ministry's representative at the beginning of the month.
However, they considered sanctions against Salvador, which were estimated to receive US$ 140 million after 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions involving the restriction of financial assistance and the targeted restriction of the issuance of visas would severely affect the Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development, with which they would continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the United States.
By mid-September, senior government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus concluding their thoughts on the penalties for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now responsible for interviewing conference participants, who are now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the US government assigns to the meeting, added diplomats.
Three American missionaries returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton did not wish to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to talk about them subject to anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government and also spoke of it under the condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judiciary, which is now very much evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller's investigation was also intended to focus on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was cooperating with Russia in the attack on the American elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer directly before this organ and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues when he prepares to speak again to his voters.
There are many questions here, and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor are his colleagues in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to launch a coup against Hitler if the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We didn't succeed, so we missed the opportunity to avoid the year of the slaughter that followed.
Such breakthroughs change the course of history and speed up or impede the unexplained march of democracy.
Americans are dealing with more of these breakthroughs right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in the hands of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the year since this officer reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated on his incompatibility with this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the official's report was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the FBI Brett Kavanaugh investigation required will not be exhausted or fair or if it is appointed a Supreme Judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for the Congress, which will require Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, there is a long winter democracy waiting for us.
But I'm sure it won't fail us because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy home.
She survived, she immigrated to America, and she ordered me 60 years later to light up the Saturday candles on the table with the candles.
How could you not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, making it clear that they will win over the Austrians after the impressive campaign against Villarreale in Spain at the beginning of this month to put them in a convincing position for the qualification of the Group of the European League.
The knee injury to the related player Graham Dorans prevented him from appearing in the season for the first time before a 2:2 regiment against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use it as a spare for greater achievements.
“It was a worthy point for us because Villareal is a strong team,” said a 31-year-old.
“We have entered the game to be sure that we can achieve something and take a point.
Maybe we could win at the end of the game, but there's probably a fair result on the overall rhyme.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better at the second half.
There will be another great European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am sure with the crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
The last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I now have a good feeling about this place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy; training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Poor sleep for women's fear of savings
Despite the fact that the surveyors had a clear idea of how to care for them, only a few people would talk to their family members about it.
Half of the survey respondents at the Nationalwide insurance firm said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they were talking to children about it.
“People want a family member to care for them, but don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Life Insurance Sector at the Nationalwide Insurance Agency.
You can start the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for your care unless you talk to her about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Include financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of long-term financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own resources, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health representative by setting up a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that your health wishes are taken into account by experts if you cannot communicate.
Think, too, about authorising a person for his or her finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do so on your own.

In Ilfracomb, a man was shot several times with an air rifle
A man who came home at night was shot several times with an air rifle.
The shooter, in the 1940s, was in Oxford Grove in Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot several times in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Policemen described the shooting that took place about 2.30 a.m. after British time as an "accidental act".
She didn't see the victim of her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, but the police have invited witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami, which hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, were reported by officials and the number of victims was expected to increase.
At the time of the termination of the communications, rescuers from the Dongala Regent were unable to obtain any information from the area north of Palu, which is closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake.
Some key data on Palau and Dongali in Slovakia:
Palu is the capital of Central Slavicia, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Salavezi and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It is a province extending more than 300 km (180 km) to the northwestern coast of the island of Sulavezi.
Regents, the administrative unit under the province, were estimated to have 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Slavezi are fisheries and agriculture, particularly in the central region of Dongala.
In the province, it is also important to mine nickel, which is mostly carried out in Moroval, on the opposite side of Slovakia.
Pala and Dongalo have suffered several injuries in the tsunamis following the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Relief in the last 100 years.
In 1938 he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongali.
In 1996, the tsunami also struck northern Dongåla and resulted in the death of nine people.
Indonesia is sitting on a trembling Pacific fire ring, so the quakes occur on a regular basis.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been:
2004: The major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries and resulted in the death of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Assessment, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The type of strong earthquakes affected Western Sumatra late March and early April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6,8 earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai and caused tsunamis of up to 10 meters, destroying the ducate villages and causing death to some 300 people.
2016: The earthquake struck the regent Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the tsunamis did not start, but the fall of buildings resulted in more than 100 deaths.
2018: Major earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and resulted in more than 500 deaths, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily kept thousands of tourists.
Arrest of Sarah Palin's oldest son for domestic violence
Track Palina, the eldest son of former governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for the charge of the attack.
The 29-year-olds from Wasilla, Alaska, were arrested for the suspicion of domestic violence, the prevention of domestic violence and arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin learned when he tried to call the police to report a alleged crime, and he took the phone from his hand.
The fuel was stored in the Mat-Su Preorderenska institution and was detained under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, reported the television network KTUU.
He appeared at the courthouse on Saturday, where he said he was “surely innocent” when asked about the complaint, the network reported.
The fuel was charged with three Class A offences, which means that it could be closed up to one year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of one class B infringement, punishing him with one day in prison and a fine of USD 2000.
The fire of a crime is not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Algerian Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference with the report of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend told me he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin criticised the veterinary groups when her son’s violent behavior linked to post-traumatic stress disorder after his return from military service in Iraq.
Cunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are broken and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred right next to central Sulavesia, which lies north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
When he hit the coast with tsunamis, hundreds of people were detained at the festival in Pala on the beach.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York demand a death penalty for Syfil Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died.
Saipov, 30, was intended to use a delivery truck to carry out an attack on the bicycle road along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan when he drove more pedestrians and bicycles in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saip’s “intentional” killed eight victims and “intentional” caused serious bodily harm, is recorded in the notification of the death penalty claim lodged in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, there may be a reason for the death penalty for any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, Saip's large federal jury made a statement on the indictment in 22 points, which included eight counts of murder in aid of rape, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and the charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “significant planning and confusion”, the prosecutors said that they described Saip’s way as “student, cruel and well-informed.”
“Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drak, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferruchia, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccoa”,” is listed in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the Southern District pronounced the last death penalty ten years ago.
Indictees Khalid Barnes were sentenced to death by two drug providers, and finally, in September 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty was last pronounced in New York City in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had died because of a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years before.
Both Rosenberg died on the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any regret in the days and months following the attack, as indicated in the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the defendant, he told Saip's authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS video footage he was watching on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said that they had requested an explanation of the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
According to 22 counts of the defendant, he was found innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that a decision to request a death penalty instead of a confession of guilt in return for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defence group had previously asked the prosecutors not to require a death penalty.
For Brexit negotiations, NIGELA FARAGEA should be charged, the Turkish MP says.
Nigel Farage promised today, during a protest at the Torijc conference, that he would "mobilise the human army".
Former Ukipa leader said that the politicians must "feel the warmth" of Europeans when one of their own MPs, Theresa May, suggested that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone said on his way to Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “now outside” if he were Secretary for Mr Farage's Brexit.
But the challenge facing her was that in coordinating her deep-separated species, Mayeva stressed the thoriums, inclined to abandon the Brexit that joined the separate Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his plan under control during attacks by Brexit defenders, Brexit opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayova in Brussels would try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force Euroskoptics and Labourists to choose between their package and "caos".
Mr. Bone is at the assembly of the Leave Means Leave (Department means departure) in Solihulu to "want to get rid of the Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as a negotiator and assign him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, he would be out by now,” he said.
This MP from Wellingborough added, "I will support the Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
The EU's opposition was described in the following words: "We did not fight in World Wars to be ministers now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr. Bone has rejected the proposal that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed and want to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic."
The meeting was also attended by Tori Brexitist Andrea Jenkins, who told the rapporteur: “I simply say: ‘Ministry President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not popular with our customers and our activists, who are active in the streets and lead us to the election at all.
Please leave Chequers and start listening."
In the message addressed to Mr Mayeva, she added: “Premiers keep their job when they fulfill their promises.”
At the meeting, Mr Farage said that policy should be given a ‘hot feeling’ if they were to issue a decision adopted at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to release the Brexit and we're meeting today to tell them, 'We won't let you do this."
In the message, the excited crowd added: "I want you to give your warmth to our political class, which is on the side of the Brexit issue."
"We are mobilising the human army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not be at peace until we become independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the reindeer walked through Birmingham, where they then had a court meeting in the city center.
After the group was established this weekend, the band was waving the Toriči flags against the Brexit.
The Labour Party Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives because of security problems with the application of the party after the conference was opened.
“These are people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Agreement, for the limit without stops, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a perfect farce.
There is nothing like good brexite," he added.
Warren's possible move to the president's position will be "examining thoroughly"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that he was going to look into "cooperation in the presidential city" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe Journal reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will be re-elected in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of the Trump election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation so that it can compete with Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for the president's seat.
Warren's reply was that it is time for "a woman's misfortune in Washington to repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrested after the death of the player LSU Sims in the shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that they arrested a suspect on Friday for shooting LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
A police station in Baton Rougu reported the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m. after east time.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man on the tape.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the University of South Campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head shot and died,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media, reported a network of 247 sports.
Wayde got involved in protecting a friend, and Simpson shot him.
At the hearing, Simpson admitted that he was on the scene, that he had a gun and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without support and taken to the police station East Baton Rouge Paris Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter-old young man who grew up in Baton Rougu, played 32 games in the last season with 10 beginnings, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps at the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world champion's title, and the team ordered him to let Sebastian Vettl win.
On Saturday it became the moment that Valteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it is clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong influence on the race".
Bottas started well at the barn and almost left Hamilton on the dry floor when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettl to attack his teammate.
Vettel took the first one into the box and let Hamilton drive on the traffic rope, which should be decisive.
Mercedes led him into the box later and left him behind for Vettlam, but Hamilton noticed after a few driving actions that the Ferrari non-acceptance leaves the inside side open and risks two steps to defend in the third corner.
Max Vertappen started with the last kind of network and was on his 21st birthday in seventh place by the end of the first round.
Then most of the game was without changing tires, as he intended to perform a quick finish, speed up the Kimi Raikkonen and ambush the fourth city.
In the box he finally led in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase his speed, so the fourth city was occupied by Raikkonen.
It's a hard day because Valteri was a fantastic vehicle all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he let me through.
The team did a really great job to reach the first and second places," said Hamilton.
That was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump laughed at the meeting on Saturday, Senator Diana Feinstein, because of her insistence that she did not reveal Christine Blasey Ford's letters, which the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate's investigation commission, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, corrupt and false".
“The only nice thing that can happen that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are wicked, corrupt and lying,” he said.
"When you look at the revelations and the revelations, people say, 'No, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer ... you discovered the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Okay, hold on a second.
We discovered it ... No, we didn't,” he added with regard to the impression of the senator.
Ford's letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh was sent in July, and it was revealed to the media in early September – but Feinstein's refusal to come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusation, I didn’t disclose her letter,” the officer told the commission after reporting to The Hill Feinstein.
"She asked me for trust and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But her denial apparently did not fit the president, who said on Saturday night at the meeting: "I tell you, this was a really bad speech of the body.
It may not be true, but it was the worst word of the body I've ever seen."
In the defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the President suggested that democracy misuse the charges for its own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
You have seen evil, abomination, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to drive to fight for power and control," the president should say after reporting on the Mediate website.
Elite disease: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer killed two goals for the Velikane against Dundee.
Dundee Stars have been redeemed for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants with a victory in the Saturday match in Dundee at 5:3.
The Giants reported early on two goals at the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were comparing the home side, and then Dwyer regained the advantage of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compared them to Dundee before two naked Lundvald Nielsen gave them a win.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee at 2:1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth season meeting between the teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three matches.
Dwyer reached his first goal in the game in four minutes at 3:35 at Kendall McFaull's assistant, Beauvilleer, who beat four minutes later, and gave it to David Rutherford.
In the intensive introduction, Sullivan again played the home page at 13:10 and Matt Marquardt gave Cowni the equation at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the leader of the Giants on vacation when at the end of the first third he scored his second goal of the evening.
The home side gathered again, and Bouchard replaced the remainder with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen to lead Dundee to the end of the second third and to make sure that he won with the fifth goal of his half-time team and to make sure that he won with the fifth goal of his team in half of the last third.
Giants who have now lost four of their last five games will play the next game on Friday home in Milton Keynes.
With his death, the air traffic controller enabled hundreds of people on the plane to escape the earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia celebrates as a hero after he sacrificed his life so that he could fly safely with hundreds of people.
On Friday’s earthquake on the island of Sulavezi, followed by tsunamis, more than 800 people died and many were missing.
The area continues to be under stress by strong shaking suns, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the employees fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung did not leave his workplace in a heavily swinging control pillar at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Pala.
It remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the take-off, could have been safely taken off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan to a larger hospital in a different city.
Sorry we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“Our heart is in the market when we hear it,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could reach more than a thousand, as the accident relief agency in the country said that access to the cities of Dongali, Sigija and Boutonga was limited.
“The number of the dead is expected to increase, as there have been many bodies under the ruins, and many of us have not been able to reach them,” said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The palace, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, was devastated by waves, up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the rescue vehicle brings the body.
It lacks clean water.
Mini-markets have been robbed all over the place.’
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross hits to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy that can get a lot worse."
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia, Yoko Widodo, arrived in Pala and told the national army: “All of you, I ask you to work night and day to fulfill all the eviction-related tasks.
Are you ready?’ After reporting to the CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesian Air Force Commander: Air Niugini now says that once the aircraft has crashed into the lagoon, one person is missing.
The airline, which managed the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing after they first reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the inundating aircraft.
On Saturday afternoon, Air Niugini announced that a male passenger was missing.
According to the airline, local authorities, hospitals and investigators are involved in the search for a missing person.
At the request of more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality, they did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water when they tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said they took seven people to the hospital.
According to the airline, there were eight passengers who were all in stable condition at the hospital on Saturday.
The cause of stuttering and the exact order of events remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the track.
Some Witnesses said the plane was missing the gun.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had dropped very low.
“That’s extremely good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to cross through the water flowing through to the belt to the forced exits on a sinking plane.
He said that the stewards were panicking and drunk, and he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that they also jumped to the aid of the sailors who were repairing the bridge nearby. They helped themselves to rescue themselves by using an inflatable boat that people were taking to the ground before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last two decades, 111 people died in air accidents in Papua New Guinea, but this was the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
The analyst set the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in a retrial to a man accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The analysis of the US Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movement of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night before her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers at the time he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was "lying because he was [my] trucker in Nashville."
The second inconsistencies was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
The photos on the phone show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that in time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He removed it from his life,” Hale said.
The defence is supposed to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that he should judge the jury on trial later this day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hippop?
Hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hippop has distanced himself from the original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and remake a conscious hippop popular.
In the United Kingdom, artists such as The Fugees and Commons recently experienced a renewed rise with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York Guard is suing a couple because they fired her because of the "racist" message
The New York Guard is suing a couple for discriminating her after receiving the wrong message from the mother who complained that she was "one black".
A couple reject racist behaviour and the prosecution of "exulsion" compared with "exulsion".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when Giselle Maurice found that she was black when the new guard arrived.
“NOEEEEEEEEEEEE ANOTHER BERNKA,” said Plasco-Faxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending him to his husband, she sent him twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After finding his support, Plasco-Faxman, who felt “unsatisfied”, fired Maurice, saying that her outgoing guardian, who was an African American, was doing a bad job, so he wanted to hire the Filipino, reported the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a payment for one day's work, and then she and Uber were sent home.
Maurice now claims compensation from a couple in the court, amounting to USD 350 per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was first hired, even without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, these things don’t happen,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
A couple responded to the charges of racism by claiming that Maurice’s dismissal was reasonable, fearing that they would no longer be able to trust her after the regret.
"The woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband for Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
My newborn?
Come on.’
When comparing the complaint with the ‘emigration’, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
"Are you going to stand up to someone like that?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the proceedings before the Court are still pending, the Court of Public Opinion has been quick to judge on social networks because of its conduct and way of thinking.
The storytellers of the bear Paddington were afraid that readers would not associate with the speaker bear, a new letter was revealed.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put herself in the skin of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an outstanding success."
She said that her father, who first worked as a cameraman for BBC, before he was inspired to write a children's book about a toy bear, was bitter when he refused his work, added that last year after his death she was the 60th anniversary of the book "Grenko-sweet".
Regarding the bear Paddington, described as “a very important member of our family”, she said that her father was very proud of his final success.
“There was this man who didn’t like to praise himself,” she said.
“But because the bear Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You are proud of him, even if you do not really do it alone.
I think that in the success of the bear, Paddington, he was looking in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed success to the bear Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Upon their landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were trying to preserve her life.
“She regularly called to say that she really felt bad that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nad’s call. He told me that in the next two minutes she would die, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicinal products given to her by doctors to continue to pump her heart were slowly absorbed and left her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position to be surrounded by my family and people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded an airplane with other passengers, not knowing the test she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
"I've had my head removed and all the time I've had tears running down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Complaining female sticky posters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one in suicide try to prevent others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valianian bridge of beautiful posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Dr. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he fell into depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel like me every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Sydney, said her son was a promising chef with an insidious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his partner when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm very concerned about the effect of the domino."
Mrs. Davis made posters "to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's about a friend.
Do not sit still – you must talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who was Davies' friend for several years, lost Marka, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was feeling sick, depressed, or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the gifts, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said his death was a serious trauma to them, but they had to process it: “She cut the hole into the whole family.
She broke us up.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended at the beginning of the FBI's investigation into the air
“I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for – after a limited investigation, after the duration and scope of the investigation, this might be a point for us,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would fall apart because of the established foreign standstill.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
By the mid-term elections that will take place on 6 November, there will be only five more weeks – if, as expected, the Republicans have been cut off badly, this will greatly weaken them when they try to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush phoned the senator several times to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who was presented by his current wife Ashley, now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate could gather at least 50 votes, which would have brought a coup from the position and election to the Supreme Court, Vice-President Mike Pence.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong Un came into power seven years ago, the South Korean MP said.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to the data from the South Korean Association Ministry, said that 1127 people escaped last year, compared with 2706 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were stricter border control between North Korea and China and the price increase required by the people's smugglers.
Pjonjang hasn't commented on it in public yet.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily secured demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees for illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are still technically in the war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang in talks focused on the halt of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kimo Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for the Korean nuclear-weapon-free half-way.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho imposed a stopover on American sanctions since then.
“Without US confidence there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally,” said Mr. Ri, in a statement by the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Bretta Kavanaugh as the “ hysterical” and says she is not fit for service in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, nominated the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh as the “ hysterical” and said that he was significantly inadequate for the service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosia said so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything other than that a woman would, if she had been so known, be labeled “ hysterical”,” said Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Investigation Commission.
Kavanaugh verbally denied charges of sexual assault by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost grumbled and died during the discussion about his family and high school years.
He condemned the Democrats in the Commission, and he called charges against himself to be “a serious and coordinated meltdown” organised by the liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 in the presidential elections.
Pelosius said that he believed that the testimony of Kavanaugh had proved that he should not be appointed a Supreme Judge, since it showed that he was biased towards the democrats.
“I believe that he has discredited himself with such statements and the way in which Clinton and the Democrats have fled,” she said.
Pelosij's question is whether he will try to bring a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and democracy gets most of it in the House, for a moment becomes.
“I will say so – if the Congress or the FBI does not tell the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the Court at which it is now,” said Pelosíva.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosíva said that, as a democratic concern, it was possible for Kavanaugh to decide against the Access to Health Care Act or Roe's case against Wad, as it was considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether to revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” said Pelosíva.
And they have to blow the woman.
This is a fair outcome, after months and years of pouring of anger, and can't express it without crying.
“Jockamo, when we were angry,” he told me 45 years later.
"Doesn't that seem rare to me, what do you think?"
She continued: “I was very much helped by a woman who was a director who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed the technique, which is when she got angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to said, ‘I may be sorry for you because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
It seemed to me great."
Tears are sometimes allowed as a way out of anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my most powerful memories from my early career, when I was still working in the office where the men prevailed, where I once found myself crying in unspoken anger, was the occasion when an older woman grabbed me by the neck — a cold leader who always had a few balls that dragged me to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
"They won't understand you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to have you touched."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Harta was boarded by a boat named Monkey Business and had to leave the game, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply disappointed that there was no reason why she could not run for the president alone.
“It wasn’t a well-thought decision,” she laughed 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the game and one more thing was needed at that time.
Someone then called the game “Snegulajnica and seven sticks.”
Since the campaign joined the last, it was delayed in the collection of funds, so it decided that it would not enter the game unless it raised USD 2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave her $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced that she would not start an official campaign, her feelings — gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism — prevented her from breathing.
"We'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder said.
"They'd think my official sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my graveyard.
“Did she cry?”
How the war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The initial peace of trade between the US and China was deafening, and although the battle has not yet ended, experts say that the gap between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new commodity tariffs worth USD 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion), which effectively means half of all the goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has been vengeful of equivalent compensatory measures each time, at last with rates ranging from 5 to 10 per cent for US goods worth USD 60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has pledged to move her eye for the United States and is probably not going to get involved soon.
In order to be able to give up Washington, China should agree to its demands, but the public removal of the United States for Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing knows how to pull the right moves, the US pressure on the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
‘The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic crisis in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have thought so far,’ said Abigail Grace, a professional collaborator focusing on Asia at the Center's brain trust for new American security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of the country, abandoned in a war of more than seven years.
In a statement by the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said he would welcome the Syrian regime's help in restoring the abandoned state.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder's Cup in 2018 with a final match of 16.5 against 10.5 in the Le Golf National in Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and Ryder's castle has not been won since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points needed for victory over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the championships, entered the water at the 16th hole in a couple of 3 games at his initial hit, which led to the game being handed over to Francesca Molinaria.
Italian golfers Molinari shined through all the circles and became one of the four players who ever since the beginning of the championship in the current form of 1979 achieved the result 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth won the lowest-ranking European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 and 4.
The world's best-class player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in Ryder's bowl last time.
The veteran of Ryder's eight cousins, Spanish Sergio Garcia, has become the most successful European player of all times.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
This year was hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing me.
So happy, I'm so happy that we won the cup again.
It is a team and I am really glad that I was able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The staff handed over to John Ram, who won the American Gulf of Tiger Woods on Sundays 2 and 1.
“I feel incredibly proud that I was able to beat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now he has a career record in Ryder's 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 major titles, right after Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team worked tirelessly all week to find the right way, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at a high level.
The American captain said after a bad performance for his team: "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we pressed a few on Europe for a moment.
We're running out of time.
The hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna have to get back together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder's Board of Directors and move on.
I really love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Get down.
They beat us up."
