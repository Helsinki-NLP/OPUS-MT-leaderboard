They must be very proud of their daughter.
Tom took off his carriage, and Mary left on the other side.
There's one left.
He started to explain what happened.
Tom's got his stomach out of lithium, he can eat almost anything.
Mother didn't know what to count on her son.
He knows the wine.
Tom was feeling someone slapped him on his shoulder.
Do you know who the parents are?
No words will tell you how wonderful you are.
I'd like a fruit juice.
Is it gonna rain tomorrow?
The Clinical Letter of Sumery was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I like summer, but I can't hold the wind.
Of course you do!
Mary loves you.
What do you want?
What does Daddy mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
Before the meal, she washed her dirty hands.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a high-split table on his desk.
It's not over a glass of beer after all day work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I've been happy with my work so far.
You really need help?
Being you, I'll ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting even though they invited me.
Hey, are you still here?
I thought you might be dating Tom.
I have to go to the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
You must have paid a lot for it.
Tom's obviously lying.
Right and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to call you back.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be 13 in the morning.
Cut the meat on thin plates.
I can't watch her ruin her life.
Do everything in a balanced way.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We went out to the top of Mount Fuji.
Me and my wife want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
That tape's too tight for me.
Playing the Fagot is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom was thinking about the subject.
We're having a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it to Tom.
You shouldn't be acting selfish.
Old habits are rapidly being measured today.
Tom still has a lot of work to do.
You better get out of here right now.
Tom's childless.
It's a pleasure to read.
We cut the wire.
I don't like you, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What did Tom yell at?
He's an ideal husband to me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in costumes from the seventeenth century.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
He made a lot of effort to climb the tree.
The translation of the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom stood up too.
We know everything, Tom.
I'm glad you warned me.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I'm not going home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills qualify him for the job.
The troops are falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't dare tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They don't help.
I like that tie.
We didn't behave as well as we wanted.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Have you had a fight with Joana?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered by black darkness.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom gave himself a cough.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you driving a train to school?
Tom's not going to school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom visiting?
It could be Tom, not Mary.
What if you invited me to a glass?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I don't know for sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It won't surprise me when it happens.
He's free.
These people don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet thoroughly.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy as a bluff when she got a recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time with his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you were helping us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's visiting his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in such a place?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There's not enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom didn't take care of himself anymore.
I told Tom he was a fake friend and he got hurt.
Peru laundry.
This bridge was a paid bridge.
He was looking for her.
I was late for school this morning.
I took part in the search.
I went straight to bed.
We shot at the lawn near the river.
Tom never drank hard alcohol.
Tom doesn't like working.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom hit Mary by the hand.
I'm completely happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played with Mary tennis last night.
What's your dad's name?
There were half the walls.
I spoke to him in English and found out I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
That fence is freshly wet.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're out of your mind.
We should win.
All answers must be written in accordance with the instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced.
I bought myself a bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
What are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There were absolutely no doubts.
This letter is personal, and I don't want anyone else reading it.
If I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand there and you'll see it better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
Once we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a smile.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
Better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It'd be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he wants to say.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse is moving.
I've lent it to the Countess.
I'm bored.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not such a bat anymore.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary has no one to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the pool.
Try talking to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Barman, I'll get you something to drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She used to be bigger.
I assume he's gone home.
I was in the woods.
Tom's drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd better get back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know she's nice.
I'm not going to school Sunday.
He's got his own house.
I don't usually do it tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can handle this on our own?
I was waiting for them to tell the truth.
Put it under the corner.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's naked.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Throw that balloon to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I were a better man.
You're stealing, huh?
Tom needs to get involved.
You should consult a lawyer first.
You're a good journalist.
Tom's used to it.
I love this book.
The waste is wasted again.
When I got home from work, I found out someone stole our apartment.
Read the book.
This was a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like his movies.
This works.
Don't you knock.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Can the message be true?
He's got a little pushy, he's got a little lost.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
If I hadn't been her help, I'd never have passed the test.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Do you know how to translate from French into English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Tom told Mary he's not planning on going swimming with us.
Oh, my God, Tom, what the hell is this?
Promises seemed boring.
If you need any further information, please don't hesitate to contact me.
When you get here, I'll be sleeping.
I don't know how old Tom is.
I'd like you to come with me.
I told Tom it wasn't over yet.
Judy likes him.
Tom and Mary met John.
Please don't do this.
You'll be happy again.
The child went after four.
Tom's not taking his medication.
"Did you not see my phone?" "It's on the table."
Tom went to his closet.
The first jump was bad.
Well, let's have lunch.
We should give him a gift.
In England the waiter asked us how many beers you would give yourself, half a pint or all?' Since we had no idea how much it might be, we asked him to show us the glass.
I'll tell Tom to cut your lawn.
I prefer English to music.
I like fish.
They're all screaming.
Toma's parents supported him during his study.
He's losing his sense of morality.
If you have any problems, don't hesitate to come to me.
He's cruel and uneducated and people are sidetracking him.
He killed Laila himself.
You're smart.
He's too self-aware.
Companies may have to drop out of some employees.
He didn't run fast enough to get to the train.

He visited Japan when he was president.
I knew Tom would laugh.
This shirt needs to burn.
He's not alone anymore.
I doubt it.
Tom's not raised.
I don't know how to behave.
Tom's still a young man.
I could get used to living here.
They wanted to sell the house.
Do you know how to use it?
The egg is hard.
Pedro doesn't speak Russian.
Hurry up or you won't catch the train.
There's little hope.
Where was I when I needed the most?
I went for a week without food.
You're standing in my way.
Push the button.
Poverty is an unnecessary cause of death.
Who won the competition?
My patience has its limits.

What's the matter with me?
Dad's a drug.
My father won't let me go out on my own tonight.
Tom makes candles.
Don't try to live forever.
It wasn't as easy as I thought.
She brought you something.
Why don't you just give Tom a kiss?
He's drunk.
He threatened to kill her if he didn't listen to him.
I'd like to be in Paris now.
You remember that?
I live in Turkey.
I don't want to disappoint my friends.
Mary is a very busy woman.
I don't know anything anymore.
Hungry and thirsty, we finally reached the hosts.
It doesn't matter, does it?
Couldn't you get me a blanket?
You're a good cook, aren't you?
I just wanted to say thank you.
Who's gonna pay for it?
Don't give up hope.
It wasn't cold.
Tom asked Mary to make him some coffee.
They asked if they were going to write a new dictionary.
It grows tomatoes in the garden.
Many people don't like hospitals.
Would you give me a glass of milk?
Tom read the magazine when he waited for Mary to show up.
My name is Ivan.
I'll never get used to it.
I want to be famous.
It's not the size that matters.
It looks familiar.
Don't you dare tell me if you need anything.
I've already done it.
Tom has three older brothers.
He's living in fame.
I burned my fingers on a hot iron.
Tom forgot his wallet at home.
We've already done our part.

You've forgotten.
Where's Dad?
How were the bombs fired?
Tom said Mary shouldn't try to do it alone.
Tom had a white shirt.
I think you could help me.
Can you update our programs?
He can't be hungry, he just ate.
Tom's going to Boston next summer.
Let me help you.
Tom didn't know where to go.
Tom didn't know if that was true.
Go fast, or you'll get the bus.
I know it's hard to see.
Give me those scissors.
I thought Tom would do it for us.
You have to finish it.
It smells like your mouth.
And history has changed forever.

It's too soon to go to bed.
Tom's been waiting a long time.
What if we asked Tom?
I was very excited.
He kissed her to the back of her hands.
Tom's explanation wasn't very good.
I don't want to go to school.
Make sure you don't get on the wrong bus.
Tom visited Mary in the hospital.
I can't live alone.
All these three beautiful girls are my nieces.
Try this!
I loved you more than anyone else ever loved you.
You want me to put it on the table?
He's hers.
They won't let me go.
You can rely on him.
You lost your head, didn't you?
Tom's building the wall.
He was tired, and that's why he went to bed soon.
Why are people afraid of you?
Tom likes animals.
This car needs repair.
I'm talking to you as a friend.
How did it feel?
Insensitivity among young people is supported by violent movies and computer games.
Some criminals will remain uncondemned.
Tom likes basketball.
Tom won't be waiting any longer.
I don't deserve your friendship.
Tom used to be cute.
I can't leave you.
No one's got it yet.
Bear and silver are both metal.
Push me.
We got another chance.
Have you ever been to Okinawa?
This is the best Indian restaurant in all of Tokyo.

Copy it a little faster.
Tom used to eat meat.

Looks like Tom doesn't like it much.
I wish I were more popular.
My uncle gave me the book.
I'm in this job as a rookie.
I should've moved on.
Why doesn't anyone want to talk about it?
I wish I was as young as you.
Do you know who broke the window?
They're afraid of me.
It was my duty to do it.
You really want to stay young forever?
I'll be in the basement.
We'll have to find a new place soon.

How can I forget?
It's me who usually cooks for the family.
Let's go out.
Somehow I was inspired.
Have you seen my pen?
Marie's Tom's own sister.
Mary is more honest than Tom.
You're destined to this fate.
Don't say hops until you skip.
Can't you help Tom?

He never apologized for anything.
There's a lot of beautiful girls around the world.
I like art.
I don't think he's coming.
I skip video ads whenever I can.

It's time to heal.
You can't kill me.

I'd like to lie down.
Tom left the job and moved to Boston.
He shuts it down, so don't touch it.
Tom can't speak French at all.
We've got a couple of classes together.
Did anyone ask me?
The phone has to be reached.
Tom often makes the same mistakes.
But I understand you pretty well.
Why don't you remember?
Layla himself could easily beat it.
Where's the dog?
Do you like traveling?
I like her nature.
Tom quickly cleaned up his room.
Don't leave your glasses on the ground.
