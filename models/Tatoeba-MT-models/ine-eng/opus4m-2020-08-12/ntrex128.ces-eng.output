Members of the Assembly of the United States are afraid that they will “seem to be Mupeti”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are confused with the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The proposal is based on plans to change the name of the meeting in the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the meetings across the political spectrum are afraid that the name might cause ridicule.
One member on the Labour Party stated that his group feared that "it was romantic with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In the size of twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid party said that the group as a whole "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative stated that his group was going to change the name "with open mind", but noted that MWP is close to Muppet's word.
In this context, the English letter "w" is similar to the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on how members of the General Assembly will be called will, of course, be on their own."
The law of the Welsh government of 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals, where broad support was given to the option of calling the Velš Parliament meeting.
As regards the title of the members of the meeting, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP version received the largest support in the public debate.
The members of the meetings clearly propose alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus may bring the concerns of President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules for the disqualification of members and the proposal for a committee system.
The members of the meeting will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians will go to vote on the change of country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The outgoing vote should resolve a ten-year ongoing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim in Greek territory and repeatedly protests against the EU and NATO country membership request.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite's change of name, has declared that he will not vote.
Speakers of the referendum, including the chairman of the Zoran Zaeva government, however, argue that the change of name is simply a price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will silence because the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"There's nothing there today."
He thinks it's understandable that the bar goes missing.
"People are meeting today in a different way," he says.
"The bar is no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly walk."
As for the churches, he is afraid that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments of such a kind that do not help the rest of the sanctuaries in the quarter.
"The simple majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and that is why the day will soon come when these churches will be closed completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches built a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose godly devotions were carried out in the near future.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was in front of a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping bubble in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise black people.
The fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin, proudly called the bell bells of the poor.
The expert who played the bell in July called it "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical tool".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell game in the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that no one has replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin has been playing a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom have called numerous church representatives, and others of the episcopal diocese.
In July, the Council of the Elders – the head of the parish, consisting of lay representatives – sent a letter expressing concern that the dices will "try to lower costs" to the council of the elders, although the hiring of architects and builders who sent the dices has not participated.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who drowned for the hummingbirds
According to the official report, on Saturday, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who drowned for the hummingbirds in California on the day of the start of the humming season.
There was an attack shortly before 7 a.m. near the beach Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had drowned with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he fell to him with the whole group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that the call was first considered a joy from the hummingbird catch, but then “you realized that he was screaming, ‘ Kiss me!
He kissed me!"
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that "he had a broken whole area of the bone."
“I cried out to everyone to go out of the water: ‘In the water there is a shark!’” Hammel said.
The boy was taken to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego in critical condition.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Sailor pp. Larry Giles at the press conference said the shark had been seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Investigation and security authorities have closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca after Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to market cosmetics in Britain
Sainsbury's wants to build chains of Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams cosmetic streets in the style of a commercial house where specialised shops will be available.
In the context of a strong market entry with cosmetics in Great Britain, which has a value of 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while selling fashion and domestic needs decreases, streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find the use for regals that were previously used for television, microwaves and domestic needs.
Sainsbury's states that it doubles the size of the offer of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and first introduces brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also get the current range from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees brands like those in shops like Boots.
Supermarket also again introduces its make-up Boutique range, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s shops will test the concessions of Fragrance Shop perfume retailer. The first such trade was opened last week in Croydon in South London and will occur next year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Buying online and moving towards the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people.
Director General Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that shops will increasingly look like business houses, because a chain of supermarkets are trying to improve the supply of services and non-food products to combat discount sellers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of sales of the Argos branch and also introduced a series of Habitat departments, which are chains that he bought two years ago. As a result, sales of food and acquisitions have increased even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to redefine the department with the cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended unfavorably.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested the joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after the dispute about the distribution of proceeds from the sale of medicines in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s three years ago sold his 281 medicines for 125 million pounds of Celesio, which owns a chain of Lloyds medicines.
Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four sales.
Business Director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the appearance and style of the street with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be able to consult customers.
Our brand range should satisfy all the needs and the soft environment and the convenient position means that we are now presenting an attractive place to buy cosmetics that changes the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is "disturbed" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract for 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones series is "urry" after the TV moderator Holly Willoughby resigned from the $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and Truly's accessories.
The company of this couple was compared to the Goop's actress Gwynet Paltrow.
Seventy-five-year-old moderator announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby blew up the star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones series by abandoning their lucrative lifestyle business for the last time – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones “screamed” when a television star at a busy Tuesday meeting in the centre of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that due to new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of domestic clothing and accessories Truly.
The company was compared to Goop's actress Gwynet Paltrow and could double the wealth of Willoughby's moderator at an estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, seven decades old at Instagram, announced that Truly left, Jones left Britain to go to one of his summer seats.
The above - mentioned source states: “Truly’s brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her for a few decades ahead.
Her decision to leave was totally shocked.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was happening, the release was so close.
In the centre of Marlow is a full warehouse of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's moderator, which is one of the most efficient British stars, could make the company a million in view of the smooth investment in products from pillows and candles after clothing and household clothing and possible further delay in marking.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and Dan Baldwin's husband have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Cappová, for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Tara Capp in 2016 and two-and-a-half-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the performance in March.
Couples ride together on vacation and Jones has 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replaces Anta McPartlin in moderating the I'm A Celebrity series on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would get from journalists for the remark that some consider to be "unfavourable president" and about how he spoke positively about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump answered with his ridiculous "voice" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore Trump considered as a major step towards denuclearisation of North Korea, Kim is interested in further meetings.
But the deal on the elimination of nuclear weapons stuck to the dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, significant North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations Wall Meeting on Saturday that North Korea from the United States did not see a "responsible" response to its first steps to arms.
Instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump in his speech expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His attempt to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results — the termination of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of the rest of the American soldiers to the government.
And he defended his unusual access to information about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act as president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside into this broken arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump and pointed to him.
The waves of tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia ravaged the island and killed hundreds of people
In the post-Lombok earthquake situation, for example, foreign NGOs have learned that there is no need.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s inhabitants were expelled from their homes, there was no national disaster, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases they have unfortunately made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit difficult," says Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children, however, gives a team to travel to Pala, but it is not clear if foreign personnel can work here.
Mr Sutupo, a spokesperson for national disaster agencies, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if international organisations could be helped.
As earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country is still not prepared for the wrath of the Mother Nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, other parts of the coast are not common.
He likely contributed to the loss of human lives by the apparent lack of sirens in Paul’s warning against tsunamis, even though warnings were issued.
Even at the best of times, travel between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that has been choking in Lombok and helping the earthquake victim is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days before it gets to the scene of the new calamity.
The improvement of the poor Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodoa's campaign and the president lost a lot of money on the roads and railways.
Next year he will try again for the election, but his government is narrowing down the funding.
President Yoko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia when members of the Muslim majority accept a more conservative form of faith.
Street fights between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use cats, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and tens of thousands of people from their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool shot a balancing branch against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the London Stamford Bridge on Saturday in 89th minute, saving Liverpool from Chelsea's defeat at the Premier League.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters before Chelsea's gate when his team lost 1-0.
He jumped the ball to the left and shot at the remote point.
She was flying high and heading up to the right upper corner of the gate.
The ball finally jumped over the jumping Cape Arizabalag and ended up on the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as fast as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible.” said Sturridge to the LiverpoolFC.com server.
"I saw Kante getting closer to me, so I didn't think too much about it and shot at one touch."
Chelsea in half time led 1-0 after the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
Attacker Blues sent a passport back to Matthew Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted at half Liverpool.
The coin ball won fast.
Then he sent the ball to the beautiful street of Hazard into calcium.
He fled the defense and ended up with a left-handed bar next to Alison Becker from Liverpool.
In the middle of the 15th hour, Liverpool in the team of the League of Champions at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, competes with the local team.
Chelsea will play Thursday at 15 o'clock in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of victims of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
As reported by the Indonesian disaster department on Sunday morning, the number of earthquake victims and tsunami waves dropped to 832.
The 7.5-degree earthquake struck Friday, caused waves of up to 6 meters and held many people in the caretakers of the buildings, said at the press conference of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The city of Paul, which has over 380 thousand inhabitants, was visited by a few of the buildings.
Police arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman.
This morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a woman's body was found.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55 hours on Grayson Mews on John Street. Based on suspicion of murder, a 32-year-old man was arrested.
The police called people around who saw or heard anything to sign in.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says this: "The investigation is only at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who moved near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, whose shipping cameras could record something to contact us, because they can have important information for our investigation,"
Police spokesperson confirmed that a dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The police have reported that they are investigating and are now informing their relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed to go into the building or out of it.
When he found out what happened, he couldn't speak.
The residents now learned that it would take several hours before they could return home.
One man told the police officer that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A paying woman appeared on the spot.
He's still saying, "That's terrible."
At 14 o'clock, there were two police supplies behind the tape and another waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the closed area who are monitoring the house.
Anyone who has any information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on number 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 of September 30.
Socha Cromwell in parliament has recently become an asset to the "rewrite history" dispute.
His expulsion would be deserved punishment for his fanatical Puritan followers in the Taliban-style destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "a joke" and "a dream of rewriting history."
The president of the Cromwell Society John Goldsmith says: “In the ongoing debate on the removal of the soybeans, it was inevitable that one of the goals would also be to take Oliver Cromwell’s position before the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't even have an iconoclassism in English civil wars.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The excellent creation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century's view and part of the character's history that many think they still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today it is less than at the end of the 19th century, to defend parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unmistakable historical debate.
It is true that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has created the following development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identified position that represents one side of this division.
His success in the role of the Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Killing pig tore off a Chinese farmer
According to local media, there has been an attack and death by a pig farmer in southeastern China.
As the newspaper South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man with only the name "Yuan" was found dead with a blood clot in the bloodstream near a loop on the market in Liou-pchan-shuj in Kuay-chou province.
The pig breeder is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs in September 30 May 2005 in the city of Si-ning in the province of Čching-chai.
Supposedly he came on Wednesday with a cousin from the adjacent province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the next door was open.
According to him, there was a big blood-thirsty ass in the shithole.
According to the information, during the forensic examination, it was confirmed that 250 kilograms per farmer had been destroyed.
"The brother had his legs all bloody and torn," quoted the journal Guiyang Evening News brother, named after "Wu".
It's on the security camera record that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pig was locked up so that nobody else could think of it when the police collected evidence at the scene.
The representatives of the market allegedly deal with the Yuan family for compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on people are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016 the pig attacked the woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts and the man was critically wounded.
About ten years ago, 300kg of pigs pulled a Velesian farmer to the tractor and dragged him to the farmer's wife.
After the Oregon farmer ate his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They're hunters... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
Rose Hurricane Residues Bring Southwest USA Heavy Rain
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to be weak and moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, it will bring floodwaters to northern Mexico and southwest USA.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa reached wind speed 137 km/h, representing Hurricane Category 1, and was 620 km south-east of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific, there is a low pressure barrier and it moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday, it will be like a tropical storm and begins to push tropical humidity north to the southwest of the USA.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity, then, with an approaching low-pressure barrier in the next few days, triggers heavy rains in the southwest of the United States.
Contaminants 25 to 100 mm locally cause dangerous influx, sutium currents and possible soil drying in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity means that precipitation will reach 50 to 75 mm in an hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the United States, especially above most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Under rapidly deteriorating conditions, due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain, wave floods may occur.
Because of the dangers of tropical rains, it would be very unwise to walk into the wilderness.
A strong rain may cause the canyons to become estuary rivers, and the storms will bring local storm winds and flying dust.
Nearing the edge of low pressure will bring strong local collisions on some parts of the southern coast of California.
Total collisions over 13 mm may occur, which could result in smaller currents of sutina and cluster cars.
It will be the first rainfall in the rainy season in this region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, single tropical crossings begin to approach Arizona and on Monday evenings and on Tuesdays the rain spreads.
On Tuesday, the strong rain will spread to four horns and will last until Wednesday.
In October we can expect intense changes in temperatures across the US, because the Arctic is starting to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be full of heat.
This sometimes leads to rapid heat changes in short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the U.S. average Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will try to expand their summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and east of the USA, a warm start is expected in October with temperatures around 27 °C from southern payments to the north-east of the USA.
In New York City there could be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows in the first half of October a high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the USA.
Brett Kavanaugh survey was followed by over 20 million people
More than 20 million people were watching the six television channels of a fourth-rate candidate's confession to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault, allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued, and voters interrupted regular programmes with reports of a sudden Friday return: an agreement that the Senator for Arizona, Jeff Flake, has made with the FBI to conduct a weekly prosecution of the indictment.
Christine Ford told the senate court panel that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been sitting on her at a high school party in drunkness and trying to get her dressed.
In his excited statement, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure it didn't work.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were watching the event, as reported by agency Nielsen.
The company calculated average monitoring at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for the other stations that sent statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking at offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who are watching football matches in play-off or sharing Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the greatest surveillance from all the stations when, according to Nielsen, it was monitored by an average of 5.69 million spectators throughout the day's hearing.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million spectators.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million spectators.
The interest continued even after the end of the deal.
Senator Flake was the main character of the Friday drama.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras caught him on Friday morning, screaming protestant when he was going to take a lift to the trial commission.
CNN was able to tell me how he stood up with his eyes closed for a few minutes and let himself be turned on.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard, "You have power, while many women are weak."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the door was closed, he added that he would say more to the committee's proceedings.
All cable and television networks were later broadcast live when the judicial commission was required to vote on the submission of the Kavanaugho nomination for the whole Senate vote.
But Flake said he would do so only if the prosecution against the candidate was investigating the FBI next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flakea partially convinced the talks with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without the investigation the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of Brexit 'political'
Prime Minister Theresa May accused Sunday Times of criticising his plan to leave the European Union that "political people" about the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, 29 September 2018.
In another discussion near the front page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to choose their tariffs amongst themselves was "inconceivable".
Shooting Waydea Simse: Police arrested Ditheon Simpson, who is suspected of LSU's death
Police arrested the suspect in case of the shooting of Wayne Simse, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department stated that Ditheon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on the basis of a second-degree murder charge.
The authorities published a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson and, according to the Sims police, lost his glasses.
According to the WABF channel under CBS, the police secured the glasses at the scene of the crime and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, he admitted to shooting Waydea.
According to the defendant, the bail was set at USD 350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was head and neck injuries.
The department thanks the police unit for the state refugees of Louisiana, the criminalist state police labs, the Southern University police and local citizens to help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director LSU Joe Alleva thanked local police officers for "dipping and trying for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
In the last season, he had an average of 5,6 points and 2,6 leaps to the game.
basketball coach LSU Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayne's death was a team of "shocking" and "shocking" him.
"This is what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
Sop's ash on Mexico City
Ash that flows from the soup of Popacatépetl struck the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned the Mexicans not to get close to the sink after the volcanic activity increased and 183 gas and ashes emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was followed by a number of riots and earthquakes.
On social networks, pictures of the front glass of cars covered with a thin layer of ashes were found in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the sop, which is 72 kilometers (45 miles) south-east of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a power of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Before the annual independence vote, the police met with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting the independence meeting with the police and thousands of people engaged in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first annual independence vote distributed by Catalan.
Ordered policemen blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint after them. The streets, which are usually flooded tourists, created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, there were also leaks that the police had to use gloves to calm down.
The groups supporting independence for several hours sang "We do not forget, forgive" face to face the protesting members of the Union who called "Let Spain Live".
According to local press, 14 people were easily injured during protests.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal but separatist Catalans celebrates, remains a tension in the region that is still trying to gain independence.
The majority of voters expressed their independence, but participation in the elections was low because they were boycotted by the resistance to withdrawal.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police in violent clashes across the region tried to put an end to the vote in the polls.
The independence support groups stayed out Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose another route.
Eighty-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for independence for Catalan.
“Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
My parents cried out with joy that they could vote, but now we're in the blind alley," he said.
Despite the important fact, although the close victory in the regional elections last year in December of the Catalan party supporting independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either themselves went to exile or were waiting in court for their participation in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-four-year-old Mounter Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and said the conflict had sparked politics on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting since the end of last year in prison, announced on Saturday that the next year he will be running for the European Parliament.
"The candidacy in European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression we have witnessed by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men incarcerated after the car crash into the house
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were imprisoned after being repeatedly in the Londonderry house.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, maybe someone shot the car out of the hole.
Meng's hit secured Livingston's victory 1-0 over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston was to ensure victory
Livingston, who came down from the lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerard a second defeat out of 18 matches as a club manager from Ibrox.
Dolly Mengy's hit proved decisive when Gary Holt's team hit the hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team this season has not yet won the Premiership league on the guest field and next Sunday will be set up by the first Hearts, which loses eight points.
Earlier, Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Livingston expanded a series of games without a defeat in the division to six matches, so coach Holt, who set up Kenny Miller last month, hasn't tried a defeat yet.
Livingston didn't take a chance against the unremarkable guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before the goal, because his strength caused Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he failed before the door, and then Alan Lithgow in the lock just passed the head of Craig Halkett before the gate.
Homely enough to watch Rangers play before them because they knew that guests could suffer from standard situations.
And so came the key target.
Against Rangers he was ordered a free bath and Livingston created a cave, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sent Mengu, who ran and scored the ball in the middle of the plain.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the holding of the ball, but the home defense for them was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's barber was mostly not in a lot of work.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into action.
Scott Pittman stopped the legs of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow from another standard situation in Livingstone.
In the playing field of Livingston, the centers that the players were constantly cleaning were flying, and there were also two penalty copies – after Halkett's attack on the replacement Glenn Middleton and others by hand.
"Fenome" from Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were without exception outstanding and on their way up they continue to overcome expectations.
Their style of games and crew have almost changed since the return to the top, but Holt deserves great praise for the way the team has worked out since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, led by a great organized defense, while Menga kept up with Connor Goldson and Joe Worall all the time.
Rangers have a lack of inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerard, but these standards are no longer met.
Their finals were chabá – only once they penetrated the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call, because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan attended a mixed reception in Kolina
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29th) for their breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and everyone laughed.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have not agreed on a number of topics, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for the Colin, where he opened a huge new mix.
There is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey in this city.
The police for security reasons prevented 25 thousand people from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them the Kurds – were also heard, protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposite protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as heroes, and others condemned as an autocrat.
The accident in Deptford: The cyclist died after the crash with the car
In London, a cyclist died after a car crash.
There was an accident at about 10:15 local time near the Bewood Street intersection with the ruins of Evelyn Street in Deptford on the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and soon the ambulance arrived, but the man was dead.
There was only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the site of the Saturday tragedy in an accident on Children Street, when the driver was caught.
Metro police have indicated that the police are now trying to identify and inform their relatives.
The road is closed, buses drive on replacement tracks and drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: In trouble, six guards were injured
According to the prison office, six guards were injured during the riots in a man’s prison with high regard.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and are still going on.
In order to deal with the outbreaks involving eight prisoners in one wing, the Specialized Supervisors from the Tornado team were appointed.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
Speaking in prison, he said: “In order to deal with the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, special training was given to prison workers.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend longer time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison director had ended his arrest in the hospital.
And last October, a number of police officers were sent to prison for serious disturbances, where personnel were attacked by bullets.
Hurikán Rosa threatens with the waters of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where it is dry can prosper)
It is not customary for Arizona to hit the tropical edge of low pressure, but it will probably happen at the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the Hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of influx.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning warning against floods on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona for South and East Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have been kept up to 320 miles [320 km] from Phoenix the status of the tropical storm or the pressure below!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane another 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Hurricanes predict 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plain, it is likely to fall from 25 to 50 mm, with local edges up to 100 mm.
For those who are not threatened by the tides, the rain of Rosy can be a blessing because the area has hit dry.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these collisions may even help, because the southwest of the United States has just hit the drought.
Server Weather.com states that according to the U.S. Drought Monitor service, Arizona enjoys more than 40% at least "extreme dry", which is the second highest category.
The road to the Rosa Hurricane will take you to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the strength of the hurricane with the maximum wind speed 137 km/h, then Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at speeds 19 km/h to the north.
Then the storm will meet with the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, so it will lose its power.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, which is a major risk of flooding.
"In the area from Baja California to the northwestern Sonor, total precipitation is expected 75 to 150 mm, with up to 250 mm," says the server weather.com.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north and on Tuesday in the early hours to the Arizona border. Then she passes Arizona and on Tuesday evening she enters the southern Utah.
"The main risk of Rosy or its remains is expected to be very severe collisions in Baja California, the northwest Sonor and the desert southwest of the USA," the National Centre for Hurricanes is informed.
These rains are expected to cause deadlyly dangerous flood and flooding of the Sutiny in the deserts and droughts of the soil in the hilly terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
According to police from Avon and Somerset, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the area of Radstock.
Cops are looking for witnesses who might have a cell phone record of what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "taste for vanity and rebellion" Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the neutral and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump stated that during the process of his nomination, Kavanaugh “tasteed for vanity and rebellion” by the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh spoke before Congress, where he firmly and emotionally refused to call Christine Blasey Ford that she was sexually assaulted a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also spoke at the hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that “the American witnesses of Kavanaugho’s splendor and quality and courage were on that day”.
The representative of his supporters from West Virginia said that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugha is the confirmation of one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service account”.
The President spoke directly on Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to take part in the mid-term election.
“Five weeks ago, one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't hesitate, but I'm still in motion," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump stated that the Democrats had decided on "resistance and obstacles".
The Head of the Republican Party advised CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate's ground was expected no later than Friday.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to increase
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit extensive earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which destroyed huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On Friday at the beach in Palu, hundreds of people met at the festival. During the summer, however, the coast was hit by up to six meters of waves that killed and destroyed many people.
There was an earthquake of 7,5 degrees in the waves.
"When the threat of tsunamis occurred yesterday, people continued to go on in the activities on the beach and didn't run right away, so they fell for the victim," said a spokesperson of the Indonesian Agency for Relieving the BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugro's Deer at the Jakarta Brief.
"Volna didn't go by herself, took with her cars, buildings, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroo said, adding that before crossing the coast, the wave of waves on the open sea spread 800 km/h.
He stated that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
The aerial photographs published by the abatement agency show a lot of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and crushed bridges and a mixture surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by Friday’s powerful shocks was approximately 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb force released in the second world war in Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have been even increased by the tsunamis.
He described the nugro as "extensive" and said that there were thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found locked under the cracks of abandoned buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
He informed Nugro that the number of victims and damage could be higher on the coast 300 km north of Pala, in the area called Dongala, which is near the earthquake epicenter.
According to him, the communication was "exclusively protected without any information" from Dongola.
In his statement, the Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people live in the area, and he added that his workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," says the statement.
On Saturday, the agency received considerable criticism because it did not inform Paul that it had hit waves with tsunamis, even though the authorities indicated that waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
On amateur photos shared on social media is heard a man on the higher floor of the building with a desperate scream warning people on the street from approaching tsunamis.
Within a few minutes the coast will strike a water wall that refers to buildings and cars.
Agent Reuters was unable to verify the record immediately.
Earthquake and waves caused a major accident in the power plant that interrupted communication around Pala, so the authorities could only coordinate rescue work difficult.
According to the military authorities, cargo aircraft began to be sent from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transport and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Pal on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When the workers of the World Vision organization from Dongala arrived in the city of Paul, where the employees were hiding in shelters from the fences built in the court of the office building, they saw the images of the riots on the way, says Mr. Doseb.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began disaster relief efforts, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience should not come to Paul.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, resources and personnel abroad may begin to flow instead of calamity until the national disaster zone is declared.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," says the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says “OK, this is a national disaster”, we can start international aid, but it is not yet.”
When Paul was born the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunamis, friends and relatives of those who are still unconscious still hoped that their love would be the miracles that alleviated the dark stories of natural disasters.
They pulled out of the little boy's channel on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was imprisoned for two days by her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists in the Asian games that ended up in Indonesia this month.
Other people imprisoned at Roa Roa's hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon cured how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel, he was desperate to send reports through WhatsApp contestants from Pal who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, but instead of two blue markings, ended with a gray mark.
"I think that means that the reports have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took 26 750 USD while supplementing the ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to the police department's press report in Newport, on Friday morning the thieves cut off 26 750 USD workers from Brink to supplement the ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver emptied the ATM in the fun complex and prepared to put another money into it.
When he did so, another man "run out behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse with money to be put into the ATM.
According to the press report, several suspects fled the scene, but the police did not clarify the number of people involved in the incidents.
Please inform the police in Newport at number 859-292-3680 of the identity of the suspect.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes its name – to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "A being formally known as Kanye West."
Twenty-one years old West has a nickname Ye for some time and a pseudonym used as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes before his show in Saturday Night Live, where he should introduce his new Yandhi album.
In the show he replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "citizen reasons," as the creator of the show said.
The West has already said that the word for it has besides the abbreviation of the existing professional name and religious significance.
"In my opinion, "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "thy"," West was heard at the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with the loud moderator Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us.
It has changed from Kanya, which means the only one, only Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
She changed her name to a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Former West's collaborator JAY-Z also wrote on his behalf with the associate and without him and with large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the approaching 50th anniversary of the bloody attack on students, the newly elected Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, committed that he would never use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the army to push the Mexican people."
At a time when left student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968 and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He stated that the unemployment and lack of opportunities for education attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on Kai-Fu Lee's artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the USA should double the amount that they are investing in research in this area.
The commentary comes after the various parts of the US government have published announcements about AI, although the US as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China has introduced a plan that aims to be an innovative AI unit by 2030.
"The duplication of the AI research budget would be a good start because all the other countries are far beyond the USA and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
Lee said this week in the CNBC discussion that double funding could double the chance that the next major AI discovery will be made in the US.
Lee, who released his book “Superpower AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order” to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the general director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face++.
At the University of Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on the AI system, which won the best American player in the game Othello, and later he was the leader of Microsoft research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee assessed the previous US government's technological competition, as was the Robotic challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when it would be next to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, according to Lee.
"Academies don't take China, but corporations," Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
In order to improve the efforts in the area of AI, according to Lee, the United States could also help change immigration policy.
"I think that doctors in the AI field should be automatically offered green cards," he says.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides finance to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organisations are giving money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
This year, the US Ministry of Defence set up the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is to involve partners in the industry and in the academic environment, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, this now invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation, which wanted to set up the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has failed for a number of months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum whether they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, people from Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which blocks requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim in its territory and therefore vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded the proposed new name agreement in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenian population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott had raised doubts as to whether at least 50 per cent of the voters would be delivered to the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
The beneficiaries of the name change, including the President of the Zoran Zaeva government, argue that it is a price that is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successive countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
The referendum is not mandatory, but enough Members have said that they will be guided by the result of the vote.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
However, voting was only 16 per cent versus 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters finally gave their vote.
"I went to choose for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old volunteer from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko are giving their votes in the Macedonian referendum on the change of name that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and pulls the chairs in front of the states of the people who are fighting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with a head raised, not a door for service," Kavadarkov says.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 %, so much investment needed.
"I think a large majority will be for, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, the result of "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the referendum could take place between 30 and 43 per cent of voters – which is less than the required participation.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma TV station, found that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they'd choose yes.
To be successful, the referendum must be attended by 50 per cent plus one volleyball.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major wound to the policy of the Western government since its arrival last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City went for a target across Brighton's entire defense.
Sergio Aguero and Rahem Sterling made a defense of Brighton on Saturday, and thus secured Manchester City a 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguera's goal at 65 minutes seemed ridiculously easy.
It all started with the play that the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He sprinted between the three British defenders and got into the open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green dresses.
On the edge of Brighton's puzzling territory, one of the defenders went around and ran a few more.
He found Sterling next to the play on the left.
The English attacker attached the ball to the puddle area back to Aguer, who right-handedly beat Brighton Mathew Ryan to the right-hand side of the network.
"Aguero has leg problems," the city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We thought he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky to have scored at the moment."
The first advantage for Sky Blues in this game was the Premier League but Sterling set up.
This target fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep into Brighton's territory.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
He worked his ball and then sent Sterling to a remote point.
The attacker Sky Blues placed the ball on the net just before he shut down the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Champions at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to rob Rockies of joy
When the Nationals were cut off from the play-off fight, there were not many reasons to perform again.
But forever competitive Scherzer hopes that he will be placed on the spot Sunday in the race against Colorado Rockies – but only if they have Rockies, who lead in the NL West for one match over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope to play off.
On Friday evening, Rockies secured at least a wild card winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play anything, we can at least start because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing, and the second team will play with the greatest effort I’ll experience this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play that?"
Nationals haven't announced who's going to start on Sunday, but they're supposed to be leaning on Scherzer for such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start.
This season's right-hand Washington climber has statistics 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 changes.
Trump came to a meeting in West Virginia
The President spoke directly about the situation surrounding his candidate at the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans taking part in the mid-term election.
“In November everything we have done will be in bet.
One of the most important choices in our lives remains for five weeks.
It's one of the big, big – I don't run, but we're still moving and fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take over too much with whatever means are needed, you see the nullity, the resistance.
They don't care who gets hurt, who has to overcome to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "resistance and obstacles".
“And you see it in the last four days,” he added, saying that the Democrats are “enragment and evil and resistance and humiliation.”
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the senate committee, democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, which led to a loud bloating of the ombudsman.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, um, wait – it was really the wrong language of the body – the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse opinion stream.
It is intolerant to those who express their views
When moment activists in my local side voted for my reminder, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to whom they said they were not welcome – because they sincerely said their opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan from Parliament was treated similarly, because she was resolutely anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, paradoxically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Friday Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East said that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years I was a local member of parliament on the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today do not allow, and the promise of a "more kind, more polite" policy has long been forgotten if it ever started with it.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different views on the labour market are not tolerated and each opinion is assessed as acceptable for the management of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues, whom I had previously thought we had similar political views, were all of a sudden expecting me to turn 180° and stand in a position that I could not otherwise agree with – whether it is national security or a single EU market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t even matter what I say – then there is a tyranny of social networks where they challenge my appeal, condemn the policy of the centre and tell me that I shouldn’t be on the Labour side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because comments about me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a daily shortage of sexist or racist insults, but they will never get there.
One of the aspects of this era of politics, from which I am most disappointed, is how the abuses become a norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the most diverse opinion stream, and with every proposal to express disbelief or change the rules of choice, the party is becoming more limited.
Over the past two years, I have been advised to stick back, not so much, and then "I'll be fine".
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I entered Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who let my class of general school literally disintegrate, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who need it most – whether as a local councilman or minister of government.
I've never hidden my policy in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would just say that when the country goes to Brexit, which harms households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My main message, however, is not the Momentum in Nottingham, but my wishes, whether they are already members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of withdrawal or political pragmatism will discourage me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP of Parliament for Nottingham East
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Air climbs to the top
The two late fives drew a bit of a final score, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this wonderful fun game Tennnent's Premiership.
Now they're in the front of the table as the only failure.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and a better use of the chance, which helped the home win, and the viewer Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
"We have been through great trials in our games and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All honor to Ayra, the chances are better than us.”
Grant Anderson's five in the 14th minute, changed Frasier Climate, sent Air ahead, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, which was released by the Warriors for the match, enabled Melrose to take advantage of the numerals and Jason Baggot got an unchanged five.
Climo increased Air's leadership to the Penalties, and then in the middle of time he scored and changed his solo test, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Air.
But Melrose started the second half well, and the five Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a further delay due to the serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who left the playground on the carrier, and when he started playing again, Air rekindled thanks to the five Stafford McDowall, who changed the climate.
Deputy Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose used the player again thanks to the unchanging five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
However, the home came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow for the attack on the ballless climate, MacPherson from the penalty series put the ball behind the passing little Air.
The climate changed, almost again from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's ass and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five domestics.
The Star Still Game starts a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is moving into the hospitality sector. It was found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 16th-century actor is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he plays together with a long-standing comedian partner, Greg Hemfill.
The two announced that the coming ninth series would be the last series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the statement in the Official Journal, Arifingmorn Limited is the director of the company.
The actor refused to comment on the report, but the Scottish Sun's source indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the "prosperous business in the restaurants" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": domestic Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The mariners are guarding before the Marine Command in La Paz, which is decorated with wool.
Over public buildings flags blue flag in ocean color.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the password: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to get it."
Throughout Bolivia, there is still a living memory of the shores that the country lost in Chile's favour in the bloody war of resources in the 19th century – like the desire to resplit the Pacific.
These desires may be greater than a few decades, because Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on 1 October after five years of term.
"Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects a positive result," says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the MSD decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of a Bolivian claim that, after many decades of interrupted discussions, Chile is obliged to provide Bolivia with sovereign access to the sea.
The charismatic home-born president of Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial fight for re-election next year – is also very interested in the Monday decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
This United Nations body with its seat in the Netherlands has no power to assign to any Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the MSD decision comes only six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not only not supported Bolivia's case, but it may have made her feel worse.
"The issues of access to the sea have been strengthened by the current Bolivian government," Zárate says.
It adds that morale's aggressive rhetoric has weakened everything that remains of Chile's good will.
Bolivia and Chile will once again act, but after that it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
Both countries have not exchanged embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with each other's benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political baton.
"The pain never surrenders its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't happen unless the United States is able to believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong says his people never defend their nuclear weapons as the first if they can't trust Washington
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations Wall Meeting.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises given at the summit of both rival leaders in Singapore.
His comment comes after it seems that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United States Mike Pompeo is about to restart a nuclear diplomacy that has been suspended at the dead point for more than three months for Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says they are "planning hope", that the permanent sanctions and US opposition to the declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes hit the North on their knees.
Washington is careful about agreeing with the declaration, unless Phjongang first makes significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, general scepticism prevails that Pchjongang really thinks that this arsenal will be denied, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Phjongang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Parisian sightseeing shows that your fashion stores will soon reach the latest trend of huge head coverings
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is at the end.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have discovered a number of massive headcovers for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the screen that all caught up with the Paris fashion week.
In the summer, very impractical hats flooded Instagram and these designers sent their exciting creations to the ground.
By exhibiting a piece of Valentina, the beige cap with a wide-angle reminder of the feathers that floated the heads of the models.
Other extremely large supplements were decorated melons, magic hat and even pineapple – but they are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the petro-colored masks have protected lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high-mode.
One production recalled the diving equipment with snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a cornea with a soaked ice cream.
And if you're going to go on with a huge mode, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge caps could also enter fashion shops.
Overgrown hats come after "La Bomba", a straw with a half metre wide cream worn by all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded the social media, sent to the observatory mill another huge creation – a straw beach bag, which is almost as big as a model in swimsuits that carry it.
The dark orange rafie bag laminated by rafie trimmings and equipped with white-skin gloves was on the Paris Week fashion exhibition piece of the La Riviera spring/summer 2019 collection from Jacquemus.
Celebrate Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion shops for the next summer – given that the designer had such great success with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessive supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are needed for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a number of academic achievements, and they continue to have other excellent results in 2018. Individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other community activities only underline this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and are trying to provide their pupils and parents with the best level of service.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we note that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes right into his heart."
This is an important point of view: If we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of this year's trials show that languages are first of all tables, with no higher degree of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned a foreign language achieved the best A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest mark A reached 72 per cent of Mandarin students, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages in view of the important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects chosen by the students are in the study plans of independent schools and other schools as well as STEM subjects (science, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
A survey carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that for reasons which employers mention as problems in holding vacancies, 17% of the language skills are insufficient.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly needed in preparing young people for their future career.
Because more and more jobs require languages, these skills are needed in a globalised world.
Whether a person chooses any career or career, if he learns another language, he will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from other countries, a person who speaks more languages will automatically benefit from competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouTube in 2013 among 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 per cent of them were unable to speak in a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, while the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, in particular 15 per cent, was French.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially those that are developing economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
Every school in Scotland is different from what language she learns.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others are learning languages that are considered to be the most important for Great Britain in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have independent schools to choose from several languages with teachers who are in the field.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing the educational environment that children prepare and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever lies ahead.
At this point, it cannot be argued that languages are essential in the global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and prominence.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will be introduced on Sunday in San Diego for the first time in Lakers
Fans who look forward to the first time LeBron James gets to the Los Angeles Lakers are soon to arrive.
Kouch Lakers Luke Walton announced that James was going to play in the Sunday opening game scheduled for San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes he plays.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told Lakers on the official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James probably only plays a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
"I do not need pre-seasonal games at this stage of my career," he said.
Trumpet performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump this evening at Wheeling in West Virginia starts a wave of campaigning.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including a stop at friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the approval of his candidate to a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming elections in half of his term of office, as the Republicans stand in November elections before the risk of losing Congress.
What time does Trump's performance begin tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump meeting at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled at 19:00 Eastern Time, today Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's Mitzrik in West Virginia you can watch online below through live transmission to YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearing the candidate to the highest court in Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very tense about charges of inappropriate sexual behaviour. The Senate's confirmation vote is expected to be postponed in a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main objective of this wave of meetings is to help the Republicans to speed up the November elections.
According to the agency Reuters, the campaign organisers of President Trump say that these five meetings next week are aimed at "adding energy to volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"The control over the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible in this turbulent campaign season," said Reuters spokesperson for Trump's campaign, which he did not want to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and media from Pittsburgh" could come to today's headquarters in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the last month that Trump is visiting West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey who is staying in the investigation.
"For Morriseye, it is not a good sign that the president must come to assist him in his research," says Reuters Politologist at Simon Haeder University in West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showed that the stomach should fight to keep its hopes off Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, the two of Saturdays could be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The hopeful cyclone is a completely thought-out sport concept, but players really believe it, and most of all, in such competitions.
So where's the trigger going now?
"They have six points and now there are four, so let's take it so that the whale is probably moving a little towards us," Jordan Speith said at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage, four points, and twelve more.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they have some wind in the plates, and there are many things they can encourage, such as the shape of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each one can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was dying when he moved from the fire to the green, and he's an example.
Famous screams further strengthened his circle, when he managed the key path to win the entire match when they were with Thomas after two holes at the back.
His trip, which won the 15-hole match, met with a similar reef that tells you the American team isn't out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left.
18 holes to leave the trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but beautiful twos in Europe are four out of four and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only two who on Saturday afternoon failed the cave, but passed on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
This passage and the way in which the energy flows towards the stormy audience confirms from him that these are players of the Sunday victory, and that by the west of the Sun over Le Golf National there will be no more favorite player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both at the same time in a different cave.
However, the talk of European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson collaborated briefly with Serge Garcia, a hero of the morning games with four balls when he was compared with Alex Noren.
The cave and the two dolls on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden into a wreck from which they no longer escaped.
But no one will help you on Sunday.
Games of two to two balls are so fascinating when you closely monitor interaction between people in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far, and by the end of the day, a significant jump has been made, but this two-player game has also shown that the US team has a stomach for the fight that some, especially from the states, have doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 points to the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cup after the two Saturday games on two balls came out with a 10-6 jump over the United States.
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly won almost twice over the fighter Tiger Woods, decided to do four cuttings in Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to hold the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the early games on two balls with an American side that failed in the 3-1 series.
The United States showed more resistance in four, won two matches, but couldn't get to the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12th match to leave the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points behind him, while he and Molinari, who after the weekend got the nickname "Molliwood", are just the second pair to win four points from their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After the defeat of the Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game for two balls, they beat the tired Woods and the American novelist Bryson Dechambeau even more important 5&4.
Woods, who played two matches on Saturday, showed occasional brilliant brilliance, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game of two to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, retired after the morning game on two balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the game of two to 2+1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Dolls - the units and threes in the world's ladder.
Europe, however, did not have it in this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris won all over the line.
Three main winners of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas were released for the Americans on Saturday at two points.
They won a tough 2&1 victory over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game for two balls and returned later to defeat the two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of two, although the first two holes lost.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-game, although as a defender of Fury's party, it only needs a rebate to win a trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems Sunday's attack is behind them.
North Korea says that "in no case" they don't defend themselves unilaterally and without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the UN's continued sanctions had deepened their mistrust in the United States, and under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong told him at his annual rolling meeting that North Korea had adopted in the past year "an important measure of good will", such as the stopping of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see the corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to defend ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the "failure" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step of the way, his statement appeared to be significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation just because Phjongang had already gone through it in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working on the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is trying to formalize the end of the 1950-53 war conflict, but the United States has said that Phjongang must give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington also faced the challenge of releasing strong international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. is continuing to “denuclearize the first” and increasing the pressure on sanctions to achieve their goals, and even oppose “the declaration of the end of the war”, said Ri.
“I feel that sanctions can bring us to our knees, is the dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If this issue of denuclearisation were South Korea and not the USA, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an end."
However, the tone of Rio's speech was dramatically different from that last year, when he told the UN's current meeting that the focus of North Korea's missiles on the US territory is inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, which threatened to "total destruction" of North Korea, he praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work and sanctions still have to be done and must remain in force until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, he said: "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Phjongang for the measures it has taken.
However, US Minister of Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council Thursday that: "Prosecuting the Security Council sanctions must continue to be severe and unresolved until we realize the complete, final, verifiable denuclearisation"
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to suppress the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes Phjongang.
Pompey and Ri met at the United Nations General Assembly and Pompey announced that next month they will visit Pchjongang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his final journey did not end well.
He left Phjongang in July and declared that progress had been made, only to be reported by North Korea within a few hours that he had issued "gangster requirements".
North Korea committed itself this month to meeting with Moon to dismantle the missile area and also the nuclear complex, if the United States adopts “appropriate measures”.
He stated that Kim informed him that "appropriate measures", in which he hoped, were the security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students participate in a course to teach them sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has taken all its students to sleep more, and it is in an effort to fight against growing macho culture all night long when students do not sleep and encourage caffeine.
Scholars have found that students at the world's most famous university are often inadvertent when it comes to the basics of care for themselves.
The course was proposed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital who is thought to be the first species in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after teaching about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this right now, in my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall agreement.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to take a course after finding that the students were really not asleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of student colleges where students click on cups with coffee, locks, tennis and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In the other part, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, death, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "studenting all night" still exists, added that modern technology and the ever-growing pressure on students mean that there is also a problem of lack of sleep.
The supply of sleep of good quality should be a student's "secret weapon" for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even so that it doesn't get to collect, because sleep deprivation turns the brain into a hunger regime, so man is still hungry.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to propose a course that during last year's first year at Harvard graduated from one of his classes.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the whole course.
He hopes that by next step he will ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting the alarm for the time when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting that can determine your Circadian rhythm, leading to problems of smoking.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga drowned Gerard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when the Dolly Mengy strike confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
Ibrox was trying to record his first victory from 4 to 1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only the second defeat of Gerard in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes ago and the Rangers composition seemed without inspiration and determination to settle.
While Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston jumps to third and immediately after the Hibernian team for a single branch.
And there might be other problems with Rangers after what the expert Calum Spence had to be treated with head injury after he was probably hit by an object from the scene.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side that moved around Air to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who last week picked up the Hearts point and would be happy to see his well-trained men choking his opponent at every step.
Rangers may have managed to hold, but Livingston did more with a ball on their side.
They were supposed to score only two minutes after Menga first left Scott Pittman on the Allan McGregor branch, but the hostage buried his big chance.
A far-off Keachhan Jacobse cup found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only try at his last post.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a quarter-hour penalty when he and Steven Lawless broke up with him, but the decision-maker Steven Thomson put down the Colombian challenge from the table.
Rangers only managed to shoot two targets in the first half, but ex-Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassana Coulibala's head and a short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening after 34 minutes could be against the running of the game, no one can deny that they already deserved it.
Rangers couldn't handle the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who was in peace and took Meng to an easy finish.
Gerrard took the action and replaced Coulibally with Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost instant results when the wing went down to Morelos, but impressive Kelly fought off the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to involve visitors in the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metal one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened its jump in the final stages, but McGregor got up well to block Jacobs before Litgow broke out of the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed charge of punishment when he got in touch with Jacobs, but Thomson turned around again.
German: Founder of Geiger's Readers
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years, and still arrives... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter's science stables became also a constant pop of culture, as in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, in the main role of apparently unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s reader that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
You can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: "Well, now it really is!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach an immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into a laboratory
Then they can "see" protein, which is common to many cancers, and then re-injected
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells has had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation into the laboratory, so they can "see" the usual protein in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-applicable to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer at Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "leads the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and "learned" to focus on cancer cells, has already been promoted in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West took part in the pro-trump preaching, in his maga hat, after his performance at SNL.
It didn't work very well.
Kanye West was kicked out in a Saturday Night Live study after a confusing performance, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he had the hat of Make America Great Again, he began to swim on the democrats and reiterated his support of President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, because he’s a racist?’
If I were a racist, I wouldn't be in America long ago," he said.
SNL started a parody show with Matte Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the senate court committee on the call for the rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the footage of West's theatre speech was recorded on social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West.
West also complained to the spectators that his head decoration had been eaten well in the back of his head.
“In the background I was ridiculed.
They said, "Don't go with that hat."
That's ridiculous!
They also said I was in the wrong place," Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his superman suit, because that means you can't say what I'm supposed to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only earned public applause at least twice, and SNL members seemed worsened, in frustration, says Variety, and one person even said, "The whole studio is completely silent."
West was invited as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing song I Love dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leading conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous characters: thank you for setting up the DAVU.”
But the visiting talk show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was "just who she is, and that's absolutely amazing."
“But I DON’T REMEMBER someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “art”), whom I believe he represents and broadcasts to the world ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he is now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and go to the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly named Snoop Lion and, of course, the lost musical legend of Prince, changed his name to symbol and then an artist who was formerly known as Prince.

The game Thrones Star Kit Harington has joined the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy of the HBO series.
The actor, 31 years old, however, came out of the stereotype macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to earn respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed that "something was wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #Metoo era.
Kit, who recently married his star of the thrones of Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that this problem is being said " quite strongly".
"At this moment I feel personally, quite strongly - what happened to the masculine?" he said.
"What do we teach teenagers about the problem we see here now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic men thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What do boys learn on television, on the streets, make them feel that it is necessary for each man to have his own page?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because the young man must have changed something to worse.
In the discussion, he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel games about thrones after the end of the series, because he already has enough "fights and horses".
From November, Kit will be playing in the restored Right West Sam Shepard, who is the story of the filmmaker and his brother, thief.
The actor recently discovered that meeting his current wife Rose for the best thing that ever took from the Game of the Throne.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my whole life to succeed," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of love of Kitov's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy series prized by Emmy.
A couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, this virus has affected more than 820,000 people.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change against the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spread across some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese doctors have introduced at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is allegedly still widespread.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually become women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would have avoided the data of the Senators' GOP, the term "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, US Senator Maxine Waters condemned the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data from three republican American senators to the law firm.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charge was supported by "extrajudicial" scientists and websites.
"Lie, lie and other reprehensible lies," Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The information reportedly included addresses of homes and phone numbers for American senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday on the Internet and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on the charge of sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak of the information came sometime after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which is the source of contributions, is linked to the Waters office and has published information about Waters staff, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations - has in no way been responsible for the failure of this information.
This unsubstantiated statement is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including from the former press secretary of Ari Fleischer's White House.
"This objection is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This means that he has no temperament to be a member of Congress."
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be stubborn.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
He must be calm and not upset."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism towards Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had warned “the competent authorities and authorities involved in criminal proceedings against these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the offenders are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my staff."
Johnny English again affects reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British trend, which appears to be the case of this re-surgence of Johnny English in a series of action parades - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this stiff satire be on the subject of how obviously we're a bad nation, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this clumsy, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repack things up in a completely new way - the name more than any other signal that is a wide comic design for the English speaking cinematographic audience.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims on smoothie glamour, has a bit from Inspector Clouseau, a spy from Mr. Bean and a great bit of the guy who sang the only tone at the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Festival of Olympic Games.
The building is also originally based on the traveller and the international secret man that Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV advertisements Barclaycard, who left chaos behind.
In this latest edition JE there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he got close to the helicopter in the middle of nowhere, and the rotor's shoes were short-circuited about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exhibited, but humor feels quite sub-dimensional and strange, especially when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Epip are now offering comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like being designed by children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy trampolines are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gags in Mr. Bean's person.
As a matter of fact, Britain has serious problems.
Cybernetic hacker infiltrated a British super-secret web network of spies and discovered the identity of all British agents in the field, to scare the agent in service - to too little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last step for the Prime Minister, who is a very ambitious and interested position, who is already suffering from a complete distortion of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson's pleasure in Theresa May's position is playing as best as possible, but there is nothing in the scenario.
Her rapporteurs inform her that once every active spy is in danger, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as director of some luxury facility, but at the same time is teaching a record lesson about how to be a secret agent: there are a few nice gags here, because English offers a spy academy like the Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his former long-standing suffering partner, Bough, who was once again playing Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the chief of the submarine, an affected character with the talent of Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin are back in action and are meeting with the beautiful woman of the fatal Ophelie Bulletin, which Olga Kurylenko has played.
Meanwhile, the premiere is dangerously subject to the magic of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the vicious Jason Volta who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odition with fresh pantaloons: masked as artists fires a French restaurant; create chaos when they fall on board Volt's luxury yachts; and English launches a clean anarchy when they try to get acquainted with the interior of Volt's house with virtual reality.
All the essays are certainly prepared for this last sequence, but whether it's more kind and stormy, it has something on child television.
Quite a moderate matter.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think of it: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really matches his talent?
Labourers deny that they would develop an English plan to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and will be paid in five.
The party allegedly wants the heads of companies to provide employees with savings arising from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a weekend - but still get the same reward.
The resources claim that this idea would "enter the economic agenda of the party and plan to attract the country to the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changing economies.
A longtime Labourer said for the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is a wish that falls into the party's stances to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not our party's policy and the party does not take it into account".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to fill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return the energy from "anonymous directors" and "experts" in useful companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in hydrogen companies do not have to return to their overall share, because the Labour Government could carry out "striking" on the basis of the alleged offence.
It also confirmed the plans to place employees in the board of directors of companies and to create own-funds that transfer 10 % of the equity of private enterprises to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in the "60 minutes" series, whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of the charge against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed his last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question whether the finding of the office might lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a discussion on Sunday '60 minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could reveal anything that would change their opinion.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the charge came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, determined, unambiguous."
However , the Graham decision is inconceivable .
"For Brett Kavanaugh, I have already made my decision and it would be a truly explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything going on."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what did it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, in New York, the annual music event Global Citizen Festival will be held, which offers a very powerful series of stars and an equally active mission after the end of world poverty.
Festival Global Citizen in the seventh year will welcome tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mailing to the world leader, calling or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert really in the way of convincing them to demand action, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people who feel that by signing on-line petitions or by sending a tweet, something changes?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from his beneficiaries, trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these events have contributed to the global leaders' announcement of commitments and measures of more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect lives by 2030.
By early 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British partnership of investors and contractors who committed themselves "to help children grow to their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end up living in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, as you are, we can only make a note in history of social injustice," the Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulllman said a gift during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following more than 5,000 actions called on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which accounts for 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and the movement against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the most effective in New York's New York this year, which will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy for the "block" that would protect Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington can "if necessary" withdraw to the Navy to prevent the fall of Russian energy on markets including the Middle East, US Minister in Ryan Zinke has revealed, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's engagement in Syria - especially where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy just as much as in Eastern Europe, in the south bank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the option of using our shipping to ensure that the maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants to the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit group that is considered to be "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to invest in or replace fuel," he said, and at the same time refers to Russia as a "one-purpose" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes because Trump's administration is on its mission to strengthen exports of its waste gas to Europe and has replaced Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, made from Berlin a "holding" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kreml claims that Washington’s burning resistance to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of some competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for the development of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perrym in September in Moscow.
The United States was interested in Germany's position, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German organization for industry, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state is in contact with our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "look closely" at the presidential candidacy in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the middle of the election period, the "nearness" is looking at the presidential candidacy.
During the meeting of the councillor in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was thinking about candidacy.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and make our broken government, including the top female position," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I'll be close to looking at the presidential candidacy."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm afraid of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was opened up in his criticism of Trump and his appointment of High Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: "Of course we need FBI investigation before voting."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" fans from Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The research has shown greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for the candidacy and 48 per cent against her.
Other highly established democratic names, which were discussed in connection with a potential candidate by 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd decide officially in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palina to meet with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year on the list in September in Iraq.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, can be related to other families that feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with,” said the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulce, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "an elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they return a little bit, return to healing, return and ask if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and flightmen and every other member of the army are giving their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, assaulting the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in alcohol, said Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new measure by the American government, which attacks asylum victims in front of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and Friday in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and question this measure, NBC said.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which was issued in August by the American Civil Liberties Organisation against Federal Policy, was not revealed.
She said her partner "and her son and members of the violent gang" abused her, but the US officials refused her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations that face all-embracing problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has reversed the decision to appeal to the 2014 Immigration Senate, which has enabled illegal immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a Friday statement, Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. stated that the new measure "is ignoring the decade of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said a short friend.
The lawyers further strongly argued that the policy that supports immigrants' entry is damaging the US economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "add the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to share asylum with the victims who were fleeing from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azyl is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," the Sessions said in their statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Hopeful rescue attempts in Pala, where the number of victims has already doubled, race in search of survivors over time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy at the evacuation center in the washed-up town of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance will bring in other bodies.
Clean water is rare."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, picking up stuff and trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were protected.
Some injuries, including Dwi Harris, who suffered fractures of the thighs and shoulders, rested at Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued severe subsequent shocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared a room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was drawn to the wall," said Harris for Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
Maybe they're all right."
The Ambassador of the United States accuses China of "shiking" propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the American journal devoted to the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Registry - the state of the largest sales news in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to move to the U.S. Congress elections on November 6th.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US elections indicated what the American representatives said that agency Reuters was a new phase of a Washington-based escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to introduce commercials in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in the escalating trade war, which appears at the level of mutual imports.
China's legal sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican side of Trump, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China now doubles this joke by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American value tradition of free expression and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited inconsistencies and you will not see any real reflection of the inconsistencies that the Chinese might have on China’s disturbing economic path, given that the media belongs to the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese news refused to publish the offer" his article, although he did not say what newspapers.
The Republicans leave their voters in front of the elections for debate with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
As many top republicans defend candidates at the Supreme Judge Brett Kavanauga, who faces several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming elections in the middle of the period, they were aware of the response, especially from women.
Emotions around this case have been extremely high, and most Republicans already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University School in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) at the last moment to try to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesting scandals "November is coming up!" at a demonstration in the hall of the Senate where Republicans, who are concerned by the judicial commission, decided to appoint Kavanaugh even through the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will keep records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was already high, it's true."
However, it could be higher, especially among prominent female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old who do not like the president, but often do not go to the elections."
Even before the public witness, Ford, detailing her allegations of sexual assault on the candidates of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, they could follow up on the resistance.
"This was the result of the confusion for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, beginning last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about voting in committee or final voting, nor about whether Kavanaugh sits on the throne, it's also about how the Republicans managed it and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, US Priorities Director, a group that helps choose Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided in the view that they believe in the light of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with a little bit more sympathy for the other appointed.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents firmly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent indicated that they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from the Flake FBI currently investigates the charges brought by Ford, as did at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, quoted The Guardian.
Ford testified before the senate court committee under oath last week that the drunk Kavanaugh attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed her her genitalia at a party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
An inventor of the World Wide Web network plans to start a new internet and prevent Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of the Inrupt project is "world superpower".
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Disk Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all at the same time.
What is exceptional on the personal online repository is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company refers to this as ‘personal authorisation by means of data’.
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to John Bruce’s Director-General, to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform to be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project cooperated on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technological developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google don’t talk about making a complete change where all their business models are returned to their feet overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in his contribution to the media released on Saturday that sending the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based website.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion of net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next age," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the spiritual celebration that won the Victorian Cross during World War I
Hundreds of years have passed since the only spiritual Church of England won Victoria's cross as a warrior during the first world war.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him, and he never realized that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandchildren discovered a monumental stone to him on Saturday at the celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his lawyers, Michael Vann, said it was "genuinely symbolic", that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to London Gazette magazine on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Lt Col Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and a strong shot from the field works and bullets."
Later he got into the first line and with the "highest courage" led the line ahead before he threw himself into the fire field and knocked three separate units.
Colonel Vanna killed a German shooter on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do, but also something that is humiliating."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, who was led by the youth group, Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, placed the vane.
Michael Vann said that he “felt great honor to be able to participate in the audience” and added that “the courage of the right hero is shown by the support that many people give.”
MMA fans stayed all night watching Bellator 206, instead got Peppa pig
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the alleged Bellator 206, just to resist your main event.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts carried out in the United Kingdom all night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's fight, viewers in Great Britain were amazed when the news turned into Peppa's pig show.
Some remained unafraid after watching the game for up to hours of early morning.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in broadcasting to children as "a form of bad joke."
"This is not appropriate within 6 hours of the morning, and it is therefore necessary to broadcast children's shows," said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice-President for marketing and communication to Bellator after being asked for this transfer.
"Peppa's pajamas," yes."
Bellator Scott Coker's president said they'd be working on a program so that in the future there would be audiences in Britain.
"I think that when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we won't be able to do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of texts went there and back and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it could be the government.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We reduced it to five matches instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried our best to keep the promise given to the fans and it didn't work out.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "minor" for sexuality
The Olympic jump into the water Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority towards everyone because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said that he didn't realize until he went to high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about the rights of gays to give others “hope”.
He also said that the possibility of becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular moderator of the long series Kirsty Young had several months off for the disease.
Daley, who appeared as a part of Laverno's first program, said he felt "less precious" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, “So far, these feelings of inferiority and differentness have been real things that have given me strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was someone who said not to disappoint anyone who could find out what it was like with his sexuality.
The two-way bronze medalist became a fighter for the right to move LGBT with a high profile and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he responded because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to add "hope".
This three-way world champion stated that his love for the man – the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – was “a dead end.”
Daley, Oscar's 20-year-old, took last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience it so much at such a young age – at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later of cancer – he said it was not easy to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar uprisings and falls.
In June, the two adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son and Daley said that he had "changed the whole angle of view".
"If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style of "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
“You know, things are bigger than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't deal with dying, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him – you won’t be in the first place, Dad,” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and until when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not impossible,” he said.
The year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew that I had dreamed of it all my life – jumping in front of the sights of our home at the Olympic Games, I don’t know how to feel better,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first composition – the Spring of Heather Small – that reasoned with him at the start of the Olympics and still caused a humid skin in it.
The Desert Island Discs show is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who was out of shape on Saturday at Ryder Cup ended up on the bench
U.S. Phil Mickelson would score a record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup, but he would have to take the form to prevent it from being an unhappy miller.
Mickelson, who played events every two years on a double record, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the fourballs and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as was often the case in the United States, he spent his five-fold main victory between the cheerleaders and the work on the game in a row that he hoped would fix what he had suffered.
This 48-year-old player has never been the closest of drivers, not even at the top of his career, so it is not an ideal choice for the narrow field of Le Golf National, where the long-term member of the field routinely penalizes the stray arrows.
And if the golf course itself is not quite worrying, Mickelson faces the exact British Open Francis Molinari champion who won all four of his matches this week in a team with the novelist Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four points less, had started 12 single swords, avoided a quick approach, Mickelson's sword could prove to be absolutely essential.
Furik expressed his faith in his husband and added nothing else.
"He completely understands the role he played today, he slapped me behind my back, put his hand around my shoulder and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He trusts so much.
He's a member of the Blues, and in the past, and this week he's been so helpful to these teams.
I guess I didn't realize he was playing two cats.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record in most of the Ryder Cup West played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup that never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson won 18 victories, 20 losses and seven remises, even though Furik says his presence to the team brought certain tangible results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great partner in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players also enjoyed the fun they were following him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving it a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a great lead towards singles from the last days at Ryder Cup can easily change into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane started the game in 1997 in Valderram, where the company led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point takeover over the Americans, but to the goal level they achieved a complete victory of 141⁄2-131.2.
"You still have to remember that we had a big jump in Valderram, as well as in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but only closely," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching in 2018 when they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of the team showed me that it's not behind us.
You'll be completely bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not up to you until all the points are on the table.
We've got a target, and that's what we're gonna try to get the trophy, and we're gonna focus on it.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, pleased with the way his players led in the difficult golf course, added: “I would never have done it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and it's very difficult.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's okay, but when you're supposed to be there for yourself, your golf player's capacity is fully checked.
It's a message that you have to deliver to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furik will make sure that his players play better as individuals than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik was personally on both sides of these great returns when he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn to end up as a defeated when Europe reached the 'Medina Miracle'.
"I remember every damn word," answered Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, to encourage his players to make their way to the last day.
“We have 12 major games tomorrow, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklyn, as in Medina.
When this speed goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
According to this, we set up a set and made sure that the boys felt like you know, as if we were going to be magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and stand up to Rorym McIlroy in the top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half.
“I went with the group of boys in this show because I think it covers the whole trip,” Bjorn said about his single selection.
Germany's new warship again postponed
The latest German maritime frigate was recognised in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least one more year due to faulty systems and snowed coasts, the local media say.
The operation of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ ship, the brand new baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing the speaker army.
The vessel was expected to be part of the maritime sector in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project has been deplored by the difficulties encountered by the supplier.
As a replacement for the older class frigates, Bremen will serve four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships, which has ordered shipping in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with an executive unit, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to install the latest fractals for up to two years outside the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the peak maritime ships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces to the sea – will be put into operation by the time of the operation of the obsolete, notes Die Zeit.
Unbleached F125 frigate reached last year when the German Navy officially refused to launch the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the manufacturers after delivery.
Only few were known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of basic "software errors and flaws on metal elements" contest, causing the warship to be useless in the battle.
The competitions on the software were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will operate the crew of some 120 sailors – which is half of the workers who were needed on the Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship has a very excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future innovation.
It is believed that the 7 000-tuna ship of the Rhineland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the metal elements, the problem is also the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew.
It is said that out of the original EUR 2.2 billion, the price for the reverse EUR 3.1 billion has been reduced.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German maritime power is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, confirmed that the naval forces are actually "coming to a sufficient landing."
This representative stated that the problems had been overloaded because the old ships had been removed from operation but no replacements had been provided.
He complained that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were capable of being part of the marine equipment.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new research is being carried out on the site of bats on the Scottish highlands, aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
There is hope that the discovery of research will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help to conduct future activities to preserve this species.
A study carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Association will monitor the bats of the starry and the smallest and the shortest long and watery in the Inverewe Gardens botanical garden in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in key areas of this unspoilt settlement, which will monitor the activity of bats throughout the annual period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the call for bats and what individual species are doing.
Next will be a map of the habitat and a message that creates a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, an advisor to the conservation of natural resources for NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of shells, and the best way to maintain forested areas for bats and other related species.
They do not fight the population in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain in the last century are killing to a large extent.
They are threatened as a result of construction and territorial development, which affect colonies and the natural environment.
The risk may also be wind turbines and lighting, as well as traps on flies and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, they are more useful in hunting for their ears than their eyes.
They use the industrial echo-location technique for breaking off the cracks and obstacles in the flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly carry out research, colony controls and sometimes rescue work.
This organisation has even created the first and only eligible booking in Threave's residence in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's residence says it's an ideal area for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's too much more that we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us understand better what they need to survive."
It underlines the importance of controlling bats before the start of maintenance work in real estate, as it is possible that unaware destruction of one mother nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, trouble, destroy or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put her hand to work and help.
She said, “We have to learn a lot about our disasters, and many of the species that we do not know how to deal with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape and his lawyers are going to complain about the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the charge of rape "false reports" and stated that people "want to see" using his name.
His lawyers are about to complain about the German Diary Der Spiegel, who reported these charges.
This Portuguese and attacker for Juventus was charged with the rape of American Kathryn Mayorgy in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he then paid her $375 000 to inform Der Spiegel on Friday about the case of silence.
A few hours after publishing the indictment information, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and marked the information as "false reports".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-person prize holder The Golden Ball in the camera.
“They want to live on my behalf.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are going to complain about the Der Spiegel journal of unsubstantiated charges, which have been designated as "an inadmissible notice of suspicion in the private sector".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times.”
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel apartment and in the casino in Las Vegas.
Following the night club announcement, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the courtroom where she was allegedly raped by an analytics according to the documentation submitted by the court in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo knelt and told her that he was "99 per cent" "blow" and "one per cent" disappointed.
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also declares that she went to the police and had her injuries taken to the hospital, but later she agreed with the extrajudicial arrangement, because she was "feared of revenge" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is now trying to renew the procedure because she is still traumatized by the incident.
Ronalda at the time of the charge of a break from the transition to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer he bought it for 100 million euros by the famous Italian club Juve.
Brexit: Great Britain will forever regret the losses of car manufacturers
The Great Britain "will always regret" if Brexit loses its world leader status in car manufacturing, the secretary for Greg Clark has been appointed.
He added that it is "disquieting", that the Toyota UK car informed the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at Burnaston, near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car stated that the impact of delays at the borders in case Brexit's agreement is not to be concluded could be a job.
In the race in Burnaston, where cars are manufactured by Auris and Avensis Toyota, almost 150,000 cars were manufactured last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would record a stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, spread fear of leaving the EU without an agreement with regard to the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, states that it will close its mini car manufacturing competition in Oxford just one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers label as a risk to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on the basis of deliveries “just in time”, while parts from suppliers in Great Britain and the EU are delivered for cars manufactured on the order within 37 minutes.
If Britain left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a breach at the border, which could, according to the industry, lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to take part in the warehouse for more than one day in the Derbyshire race, the company mentioned, and thus the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plans for the revitalisation of future relations with the EU are "exactly calibrated so that these controls do not arrive at borders."
"We need an agreement. We want the best trade that will enable, as I say, not only the current success, but also the capture of this opportunity," BBC Radio 4's Today said.
"The proof not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue in what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long term it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the race and would ultimately also be at the expense of the jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is chairman of the competition committees, said that members of the committee organisations are increasingly concerned: “I have the experience that once these places are gone, they will never come back.
The government said: "We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The tromp meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The meeting of Donald Trump at a high level with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "for another week" because he continued to fight for the position of the Supreme Judge with Brett Kavanaugh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is studying the work of the Special Council of Robert Mueller, which examines the actions in the Russian elections, the connections between the Trump supporters and Russia and the possible judicial obstacles of the president.
Let Trump release the deputy general and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, Washington's chats have been online for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president's session through the 25th Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the message.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Trump declared that Rosenstein would not "preparedly" but then the meeting was delayed so that she would not agree with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee, where they gave witness statements to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh for a week, and the Senate's full vote was delayed again.
Trump's press spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in Fox Channel reports.
In response to a question at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set, this week may be a necessary move for another week, given everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always share the current information with the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace was wondering why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were caused by an averration of TV reporters' "divade" even though she said, "I don't agree with the fact that it's going to come."
She then proposed that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press should increase.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without stating the evidence. "We were looking at these numbers."
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks and that there's a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting high representatives.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why his released and sometimes bizarre view of the gathered reporters.
The Ministry of Health writes to EU staff in NHS Scotland not to fear Brexit
The Ministry of Health wrote to EU employees who work in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's SME sent a letter not even six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to the cost of applying for a state of affairs of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, the negotiations between Britain and the EU continue to stand out and focus on the expected decision this year in the fall.
However, the British Government is also taking steps as part of the preparation for the possible scenario of a derogation without an agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reassure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to the patients and communities we provide.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our marriage wish is that you stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The rebel Tigers of Tennessee Christian Abercrombie filed an emergency surgery after suffering head injury in the Saturday defeat of 31-27 from the opponent of Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before.
"He came to the side row and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and doctors gave Abercrombie a side order of oxygen and then placed it on the carrier and prepared for further assessment.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had performed a surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that no details of the injury type/range are available so far and that the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second in a red shirt, graduates the first tennis season after transfer from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, he had five total events, which means a total of 18 events in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on real estate when buying real estate in Britain
Foreign purchases will be charged a higher tax on real estate when they buy real estate in Britain, and money will also be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
This action will neutralize the success of Corby's knowledge aimed at attracting young voters
The increase in the obligation of higher property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in Britain
An increase of £120 million per year is expected to help people without a home
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they buy real estate in Britain, while money will also be used to help people without a home, Theresa May today announces.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of the attracting Jeremy Corby to attract young volunteers with the promise to provide more affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in real estate tax will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the money will also strengthen the government's efforts to fight sleepless sleep over the head.
The premium, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay property tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago in other homes and the purchase for rent, may reach up to three percent.
It is estimated that up to £120 million per year will be raised in the state treasury.
Estimates say that newly built property in London buys 13 per cent of citizens who are not residents of the United Kingdom, which reduces prices and makes it easier for those who buy for the first time to get home.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” precisely because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time abroad.
The new principles were revealed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after a reduction in property purchase tax to help more young people to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking the land, but not using it, and insisting on Mrs. May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to repair the “home mortgage” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reformes, including the management of rentals and the termination of "inconvenient" migration.
It also wants to increase the power of committees to build new homes.
Ms. May stated: “Last year, I said that I wanted to make my efforts as a pioneer to restore the British dream of every new generation to a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it cannot be the right thing to make it easy for entities who do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy houses as well as hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the dust of sleep without a roof over their head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross states that he is his "highest ambition" to become at a certain stage manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scott is looking forward to the restoration of the North-East Club, which currently stands in the third position in the First Lise, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St Mirren back the Scottish Premiership league in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got value B and it was," Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound channel.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a child, and that’s always something that draws me back.
But such an opportunity would come only if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors in the role of Sunderland managers were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxiety about the consequences of such name-playing in such a big club when he previously refused the pre-games from Barney and Ipswich Town.
“Success would be a question for me at that time whether I can return to the Premier League.
The structure and equipment in this club are undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him back there, but I guess I'd be successful only if I could get the club back there."
Ross has been a career manager for just three years, before acting as assistant chief in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa club to get back from joining the third group and transformed St Mirren from a start-up fall on the championship title right next season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than ever in his career as a player in clubs Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably real crusades," recalls Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good and using reasonable heights.
But playing can be challenging.
There's a lot of things you have to go through a week.
I'm still going through them from the point of view of the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good in my management.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, I feel that in my adult life, I feel the most in my skin."

Research found that the great time on the paint is Saturday at 17:30
The summer wind has increased the revenues of British owners facing difficulties, but has increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that groups of houses and bars recorded a sales increase of 2.7 per cent in July – but the income of the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of CGA’s consulting firm, which produced the final report, stated: “Stable sunlight and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that June followed a pattern similar to that of previous June when the increase in farm attendance was 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in restaurant markets by 1.8 per cent in June has worsened in July.
So far, the Lords and the Bars have been leading the most powerful as the restaurants have become worse.
Lords, whose main markets are from food, also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food by three per cent fell."
Paul Newman, from an analytical leisure and hospitality company, stated: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has lasted since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual decrease in sales by 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful in the light of current cost pressures.
The long hot summer cannot be a worse time for operators of food-fighting companies and the time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August bring so much relief."
Total sales growth in houses and restaurants, including newly opened ones, accounted for 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industrial Sales Monitor for the British household, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, which is an industry scale in the sector..

A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in "false Instagram accounts" in which photographs are shared.
Reports indicate that there are concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had an attractive "main" account that parents know about and at the same time have a private account.
One mother who attacked her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found that her fiancée was urging others to "violently rape her."
Research conducted by the UK Digital Awareness Agency and the Association Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half admitting to running private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online places where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Elidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic committee
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most prized lightweight athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in sports management like those who will benefit from her far-reaching experience at the international level in the past decade.
"Eilid has great respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community, and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for athletes in Scotland if he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I am excited that I will be an athlete’s voice and hope that I will be truly successful and that I will help to conduct sports in Scotland.”
A U.S. player who won 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlantic Olympics won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert could not go after a transitional ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I went through an attack a month ago.
I couldn't go.
Doctors said it would only show time if I was healed or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to heal, learn to walk again, and today I can practice!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Milk remover triggering mother comparison to cows shares views online
The company dealing with the production of a vacuum cleaner has distributed online adverts which compares the mother-in-law to the cow-in-laws.
As part of the marketing of “the first silent portable vacuum cleaners in the world”, Envi’s consumer technology company has released a music video showing the freedom that a new vacuum cleaner gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows on a song with the words: “Yes, I feel, but you don’t see any oats” and “In case you haven’t noticed that I don’t have a cow, my breast is here.”
The congregation continues: “Smash, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, drink my sweet milk. ”
However, the advertising that was published on the company’s facebook page caused an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and it received mixed reactions from those who saw it, and many of them said it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to abuse cows on advertising for this product.
Just as we have to be pregnant and give birth so they can give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," says one of the commentators.
Elvie suction is discreetly applied to the breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Intellectually traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is completely out."
They also appeared to some who defended the advertising, and one woman admitted that the composition was considered "infectious".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd fix the pump if I were still pumping.
I feel just like a cow when I'm out.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's about things.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one user.
Another added: “It’s a fun commercial aimed at mothers who suck up milk (usually at work or in the toilet) and feel like “cows”.
It's not a commercial that's supposed to glorify or waste the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that everyone dances with discreet detachments hidden under the pillow.
The concept of campaign is based on the observation that many women who sow their milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or hats and is beautifully hidden in the collar pad, so it gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the child and even when walking away.
Ana Balarin, a mother partner and ECD, added the comment: “Elvie’s vacuum cleaner is so revolutionary that it deserves significant and provocative marketing.
By creating parallels between nursing mothers and nursing cows, we wanted to point to the drying of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new sow will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner got out.
During the London fashion week, one of the two mother designer Martha Jakubowski found herself using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly moved to the state camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants has increased rapidly despite the fact that the monthly crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially because the strong rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have made the placement of children easier.
Most of the escorts were traditionally created by immigrants without documents who were afraid of being able to stay in the country, so they claimed to belong to a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had requested the status of escorts to isolated minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the home sponsors are illegal in our country, and many of them are criminals.
So we continue to complain about them," said Mr. Albence.
According to the staff of the asylum facility, representatives are seeking to process matters more quickly with regard to children, introducing new rules that will require some of them to be brought before the court until the month before the detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
Many will appear through calls within videoconferencing instead of making their case a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who don't have a warrant to help are quick to be deported.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he is to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbreaks of swelling or attempted escape, the harder the asylum workers and the more recent reports from the system.
Advocates state that these concerns are raised in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs of the child’s loss are more likely to be ignored, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the camp without enough time for emotional preparation or breaking up with friends could lead to a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria announced that American, French and Turkish "occupational files" should be immediately downloaded
During the general meeting of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moual, also called after the return of Syrian refugees to the country, even though there is already an eight-year war in the country.
Moual, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces in the Syrian territory are illegal, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that “it will be done accordingly.”
"It must be given up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moual argued that "the fight against terrorism in Syria is almost over", with more than 360 000 people and millions more lost their homes since 2011.
He said that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle until we free all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreigners."
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria that are mainly trained by the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces fighting and advising President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 units of war in the country.
On the issue of refugees, Moual stated that they had good conditions of return and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "nerative concerns", which caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have urged international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a safeguard zone in the last Idlib attack created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a large attack by the Syrian forces protected by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Mouale, however, pointed out that the agreement had "clearly defined deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would focus on jihadists, including combatants from Nusra Front with an Al-Qaeda connection, who would "be frozen".
The Ambassador of the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to propose a military constitution for Syria and postpone the elections will soon be held.
Moual laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "control of the existing constitution" and issued a warning before the infringement.
Why Trump wins in the second time
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in the next elections in 2020 if, probably, many liberal observers, the prosecution and the early scandals of his office as President did not end.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidential period in history!"
So far, there's no sign of the following fatigue.
Since 2014, surveillance in the main broadcast time has been more than doubled to CNN 1.05 million and almost tripled to MSNBC 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average follow-up of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to the agency Nielsen and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC increased surveillance on cable television to 3.5 million following main night news.
"It's a fire that people are afraid of, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of the "Designated Survivor" series on the ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovellová, experienced comedy author and series "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Trusts About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
He remembers his taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd choose Trump.
Why?
"He said, "Because he's funny with him," Mrs. Scovellová told me.
It's important to have fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story playing in of Washington could predict the future of Roe v. Wada, whether immigrant families can re-connect and benefit from the global economy.
Disposal is a luxury that can afford only the most privileged.
And yet it goes beyond whether you're an informed citizen when you're watching six hours of a panel of experts who are discussing how Bob Woodward uses the "deep resources" for his book "Fear," rubbing Paul Manafort's leather jacket at $15,000 (the "arrogance clothing" as indicated by Washington Post) and the consequences of Mr. Trump Stormy Daniels' anatomy.
I'm not going to look at Super Maria again, by the way.
“A part of what he does and what causes the reality show is that something feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars document on the N.F.L. Trump's show in which Kim Chong-una appreciates).

When I joined Mr. Fleys this week, it was sunny, out on the northern coast of Kaui 80 degrees, but he was stuck inside and watching MSNBC and recording CNN.

Foreign money flows to the narrowest domestic competitions of the medium-term election
It is no surprise that 17th district of Pennsylvania after the reorganization of the congressional districts, which were generated by two officials in the struggle for the same chair.
This has recently led to the transformation of the suburban district of Pittsburgh, the permanent Democratic Republican of Conor Lamb, which won another district in the special election last year in the spring.
Lamb stands against the other holder of the office, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily covered with a new 17.
After the Supreme Pennsylvania Court issued an opinion in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the Republicans, a map was redesigned.
The competition in the new 17th district started a sharp financial dispute between the main party's financial statements, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name in Pennsylvania became known for its close victory in the March special elections to the 18th Congressional District.
This chair was occupied by the Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump in the county won 20 points.
Policy experts are giving the Democrats a mild boost.
America is considering to torture Salvador for China's support, then resigns
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was housed in a hotel in Panama until the partners were legally evicted from the organizational team of Trump.
Representatives of the foreign ministry decided to withdraw the US diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions to continue not to know Taiwan," spokesperson for Heather Naurutová said in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the penalties were considered only against Salvador, which received an estimate of US$ 140 million in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included a reduction in financial assistance and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and number of murders.
With continuing internal negotiations, North American and Central American representatives have postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity leading to similar negotiations from the previous year, which was outlined as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants coming to the US.
But by mid-September, the leading administrative representatives explained that they wanted to continue in the negotiations and effectively end any considered punishment for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the solution of the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the signal that the administration is putting in place, the diplomats have introduced.
And three American envoys came back to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in silence without having any new unbridled news from Washington.
Mr Bolton's White House spokesperson refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed with the debate on internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their resources were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government executive and also spoke under anonymity.
Study history
Robert Mueller's report from the Special Committee on the possible prevention of Mr Trump in the exercise of the right now contained in the public records of many evidence could be a definitive backbone of cancer.
Mr. Mueller is allegedly referring to whether Mr. Trump's campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there were any exchange of parties in Congress, Mr Trump would have to apply for responsibility before that body, just as he is preparing to appear before the voters again, and finally the jury of his colleagues would look forward to it.
This is a whole series of 'if' and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as in similar policies in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us, which will affect how long suffering will last.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to organize a coup against Hitler, enough just to build and support the Western powers in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid a bloodbath that followed for many years.
History revolves around such critical moments, speeding up or slowing down the impenetrable pace of democracy.
Americans are now facing a few similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump throws Mr. Rod Rosenstein's deputy Attorney General, this is the man who runs the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been moved since the report announced that last year he secretly proposed to record the president and speculated that he was not in a state of health to stop the president's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times version is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation of F.B.I. Bretta Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite a convincing charge of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the middle of the term of office for Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will be waiting for a long dark night.
But I believe we're not going to succeed, and that's because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, migrated to America, and about 60 years later, on Saturday, she sent me to light candles at the table with a wedding ring.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
Rangers on Thursday guests Rapid Vienna, aware that victory over the Rakušana would have given them a great hope of progress from the Group of the G of the European League, after an effective recession in Spain on the Villareal field earlier this month.
The knee wound prevented the hostage Graham Dorrans from showing up in the season for the first time until the fall of 2-2 with Villarreale. However, he believes that Rangers can use this result as a reflection bridge for the bigger thing.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to a fight with the faith that we could break something, and we drove a point.
Maybe we could eventually multiply it, but overall, the remise was probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we improved and we were better again.
It'll be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be hard, because in the last match they played a good result.
Last year was hard, with all the injuries and changes in my club, but now I have a very good feeling about it.
The team is strong, and the guys are really enjoying it. The training's fine too.
I hope we get on with it now, throw the last season behind our heads, and we'll be successful."
Women worry about saving their pension
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they should be cared for, few people talked about it with family members.
Half of the people in the nationwide study reported that they had been discussing the price of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said she was talking to her children about it.
“People want to take care of them, but they don’t want to talk to them,” explains Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the State’s Life Insurance.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not reveal your wishes to them in advance.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how to take care, because these factors can play a major role in setting the price.
Picture your financial advisor: The advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be financed through traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance that will help you pay for these expenses, or by using your own insurance with your own resources – while you have money.
Create your legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as possible.
Make yourself a health care representative, which will be a trusted person who will look after your medical care and ensure that your doctors will comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate yourself.
Also consider recording full power for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts will not be able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your old parent needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Write down these details in the written plan so that you can be prepared.
"There are not only finances in the game, but, for example, what are the doctors?" Martin asked.
“Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the said plan prepared by hand."
The man in Ilfracombe was shot several times from the air.
When a man came home after nightfall, he was hit by a few shots from the air.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hands.
The police described the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
As communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Dongala Regent, which is an area north of the Pala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter of 7,5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal after the outbreak of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the city of Pala and the regent of Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It is a regentry that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the province’s administrative region had a population of 299 200.
The main economic components of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
In the province there is also a significant nickel mining, but mainly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Pala and Dongal have already been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit West Dongola even in 1996 when she asked for nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and regularly comes to an earthquake.
Here is a list of several major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatry on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries and prepared for the lives of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: The series of major earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatry at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6,8-degree earthquake hit them on the Indonesian most populous Java island and caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7,5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatry and caused tsunamis of 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and prepared for the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya Regent in Aceh province and caused destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time it was not formed by any tsunamis, but more than 100 died because of falling buildings.
2018: A severe earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where she killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Algerian governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, violations of domestic violence reporting and detention.
When the police reportedly tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin picked up her phone.
The fuel was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrail Facility and is held on an unsecured bond of USD 500, reports KTUU.
According to the network report, he appeared on Saturday at a court where he declared himself to be "certainly innocent" when asked for a statement.
Fuel faces three Class A offences, which means it could be sentenced to up to a year of deprivation of liberty and to a fine of up to USD 250,000.
At the same time, he was accused of a class B offence punishing him with a one-day prison and fine of USD 2000.
It's not the first time that Palin has to face a criminal notice.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palina.
The alleged assault on the police reported on his mother's phone, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before the Algerian war veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of reporting domestic violence and of holding arms under the influence of misleading substances in connection with the incident.
Apparently hit his girlfriend's face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of war veterans when she associated her son’s violent behavior with a posttraumatic stress disorder caused by her son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric and communication networks are out of operation and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit directly the part of the island of Sulawesi, which is north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video showing the moment of the funeral appeared on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors require an exceptional death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are requesting a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – an exceptional penalty that has not been granted for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly in October, launched an attack on a bicycle along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan by means of a rented truck Home Depot, by which he threw down pedestrians and cyclists.
In order for the plaintiffs to defend the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saipov "intelligently" killed eight victims and "intelligently" caused a number of injuries – this is how the conditions for the death penalty are defined in the document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to the court documents, both of these numbers would mean the possibility of the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including, for example, charges of murder in favour of extortion, which the federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and preparation", the plaintiffs claimed and described the way Saipov did the act as gross, cruel and twisted."
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernana Ferruch, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," he said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York's court last sentenced to death.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Finally, the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were repaired, which proved conspiracy for the purpose of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a relative from Uzbekistan, appeared under judicial documents during the days and months following the minimum pity attack.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to Saip's charges, he told the authorities that he was inspired to watch videos of the Islamic state on the phone to commit the attack.
The police also announced that they also required the suspension of the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he was innocent of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the decision of the plaintiffs.
"We believe that the decision to require the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt and condemnation of life without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma from these events for anyone concerned," Patton said.
The Saip's defense team had already asked the plaintiff not to demand the death penalty.
According to Members, the Conservative Party should be entrusted with negotiations on Brexit NIGEL FARAGE
Nigel Farage committed himself to "mobilising the army of the people" during today's protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the UK's independence party stated that politics must feel pressure on the part of the Eurosceptics – as proposed by one of Theresa May's own Members, he should negotiate with the EU.
Several Conservative MP Peter Bone announced on his departure to Birmingham that the Great Britain would be out now’ if he was a secretary to Mr. Brexit Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May has faced in calming her ranks, where there is a great deal of dismay, has been highlighted by the conservatives who are fighting for suspension in the EU, who have joined a stand-alone protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from the Chequers in the course of attacks on Brexit's supporters, the supporters of the suspension in the Union and the EU itself.
The allies insist that they will continue to seek agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone announced that the Leave Means Leave group was meeting in Solihull where he wanted to go to Chequers.
He proposed to Mr Farage that he should be a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
'If he were in the front, we'd be out today,' he said.
Ambassador Wellingborough added, "I'll be behind Brexit, but we need to get on the Chequers."
To show his resistance to the EU, he said: "We did not fight World Wars to listen.
In our own country we want to make our own laws.”
Mr. Bone refused the proposal that the public opinion changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that British citizens would change their opinion and wish to postpone is totally boring.'
Brexit's conservative stop Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: "I'm just saying, Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
,Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and they don't like him or our activists who are currently filling the streets so that we can be elected at all.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.’
In a strong report for Mrs Mayo, she says, "Ministers will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that conservative policies must be 'defending' if they want to betray their decisions taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're standing here today to tell them, 'We won't let you.'
In the report he added: "I want our political class, which is at the scene of Brexit's betrayal, to feel pressure.
'Now we are mobilising the army of the people of this country, who has assured us of victory in Brexit's referendum, and we will not rest until we are independent and proud of the Great Britain, which will rule itself.'
In the meantime, the suspension officers in the Union went to Birmingham and then organised a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had transparency of the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend of this party.
Labour MP Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives about the security problems of the party's application after the conference was launched.
"These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for problem-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"The whole thing is a frown.
There's nothing like a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren's planning to "realize" the presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November elections, she would "think seriously about the presidential candidacy".
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday at a workshop in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is trying to re-elect the Republican representative Geoffu Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It felt at the speculatory centre that it could be set up for Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the councillor since Trump sat in the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to attend the president's office.
Warren reported that it was time for “women to go to Washington and make our broken government, which also means a woman in the highest place.”
He was arrested by a suspect of Simse's shooting at LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had detained the suspect from the Friday shooting of the basketball player team LSU Wayd Simse.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson at 11:00 Conference ET news.
A video from the Friday shooting was issued requesting the identification of the man captured on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot Friday in early hours near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered head injuries that did not fit his life," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through web 247 sports.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to moving in the scene of the crime, having a gun and also admitting the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Great price Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world's champion when the team's director played him in the hand of victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valteri Bottas finished his Saturday qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team director would play a major role in the race.
From the field of position Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two points he robbed his position and called Vetell to attack a teammate.
Vettel led to the cave as the first and let Hamilton get the cars running at the edge of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider went to the depot about the bike later and after his departure he ranked for Vettel. However, Hamilton went ahead and in a tight fight the Ferrari rider had to leave the internal road unattended so that he could defend himself in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen left the back row of the field and was in charge at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race because he was holding the original tyres as soon as possible to focus on the fast finish and he could take Kim Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the depth of the 44th wheel, but in the remaining eight wheels he was no longer able to increase the rate and Raikkonen remained the fourth.
It's a hard day because Valteri was doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he was acting like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and the rewards are the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad word of the body
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diana Feinstein at the Saturday meeting because she insisted that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the candidate of the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court of sexual assault.
During his speech to the meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the statement given to Ford before the Senate, instead stated that what is happening in the Senate indicates that people are “bad and hostile and despised.”
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that is happening in the last days in Senara, when you see the excitement when you see those people, how angry and angry and stubborn and ashamed they are,” he said.
“When you look at the issue and the publication, and they say to you, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, can you escape for that?
Remember her answer... you published the document – ah, ah, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, that's not," he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent Ford's letter with details of the charge against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to escape from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's name, nor did I publish information about the case," said the columnist Feinstein, as The Hill informed.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked for."
However, according to her words, the president, who said to the case at the Saturday evening meeting, “I will tell you that this is a really bad word of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, whose three women were accused of sexual harassment, and pointed out that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purposes.
‘There are decisions to take back too much of any available means.
You see the bottom, the depth, they don't care who's gonna hurt who's got to step back to the country to get back to power and control," Mediate President quoted the words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made a Friday victory in the Elite League against Belfast Giants in a Saturday response in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
Giants were soon caught up in double management thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for home before Dwyer returned the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard then compared Dundee again, and two lines of Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was a third defeat in the elite league in the season for the Adam Keefe team, which succeeded in defeating 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
Both teams met in the season, with all three previous matches in control of Giants.
Twoier's first branch came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendall McFaulll's assistance, while David Rutherford assigned his assistance to Beauvilier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back into the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared it at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, Giants went to the cabin for the first stop only in the lead when he recorded his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The domestics were reassessed and Bouchard again managed to balance the goal of the overpowering game at 27:37.
The joint work of Cownie and Charles Corcoran later helped Nielsen in the match for the first time to break the lead on the side of Dundee and the same player secured the lead of his team in half the final third.
Giants who have now lost the fourth of the last five matches will play another match at Milton Keynes' house Friday.
The air traffic controller died to allow hundreds of people on board to avoid an earthquake
The leading flight operation in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died watching a plane with hundreds of people on board safely take off.
More than 800 people died, and many are missing after the earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The strong ensuing earthquakes flooded the area, and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues, twenty-one-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agunga, fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in the wilderness with a misdirecting tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the line at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower down when he thought he was moving.
He died later in the hospital.
The air traffic management air navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, told the television channel Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a transport helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was transferred to a hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, this morning he died before the helicopter reached Paul.
"Our hearts are broken by this report," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster management indicated that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase, as many remains unexplained under the scourge and many of them have not yet been saved," said Sutopo Purwo Nugro's spokesperson.
The waves in the devastated Pala reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft bring aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said at Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings in other bodies.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said at CNN: “The Indian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find in place.
It's a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indian President Yoko Widodo came to Pal on Sunday and told the country’s military files: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks necessary for evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Aircraft Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after the aircraft crash in the lagoon
The airline operating in the lagoon on one of the micron islands in the Pacific has now stated that one person is missing, initially stating that all passengers and crew of a total of 47 were safely evacuated from a melting aircraft.
Air Niguini stated in the press report that on Saturday afternoon she was unable to find a traveling man.
The airline stated that it cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a lost man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requirements for providing details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane entered the water when trying to land at the airport on Chuuk.
On Friday, officials claimed that a total of seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact consequences of the events, however, remains unclear.
The airline and the US Navy have indicated that the aircraft arrived in the lagoon before the landing route.
Some witnesses thought the plane was overrun.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing at very low altitudes.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that he, along with others, managed to get water from the belt deep into the emergency exits of a melting plane.
He added that the crew panicked and yelled and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that seamen who worked close to the port moles helped to save by means of a cruiser carrying passengers on the coast before the plane sank into a depth of about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades, there have been fatalities of aircraft with a total of 111 people registered with the PNG, but no accidents have occurred with Air Niuguni.
Analysis describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The appeal on Saturday ended its speech in this case in which a man is repeatedly sentenced to a woman's incarceration in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice in the person of his analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert judgements in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst planned a scenario using the phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he obtained localized data from several mobile phones, which proved that Tellis was on the night of her death in Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statement, said The Clarion Ledger.
When it was proven on the basis of the cell phone that he spent the night with Chambers, he found out he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then he visited the police.
Sanford stood before the court in the Chamber and proved that the day in question was not in the city.
When the plaintiffs were looking to see if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was "lie, because my car was in Nashville that night."
The next disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
However, mobile records indicate that the two knew each other only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted text messages Chambers, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He totally took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the case to be brought before the jury the same day.
High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative views of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Chapel of High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop moved from its beginnings with political messages and solving social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently met with the resurrection of artists such as Akala and Lowkey in Britain.
Another black girl?
The New Year's educator complains about her rejection of the "racist" text message
The New York educator complains about her discriminatory rejection after receiving the wrong text message from her mother, in which she was labeled "more black" text message.
A few refused to be racist and compared the complaint with the "exploration".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed her fears when the first day of work in 2016 found that the new educator of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NOEEEÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉ, OTHER DENMARK”, wrote P. Plasco-Faxman to her husband in the text report.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her pie twice.
When she understood her false passport, Mrs. Plasco-Faxman threw Mrs. Maurice out and said that she was just leaving an Afro-American educator who was working really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, said the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice complains about the compensation for dismissal and seeks compensation of USD 350 per day of six months' engagement for which she was initially hired, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not happening," said the Post on Friday and added, "I know this is discrimination".
However, the two returned the blow that they were not racist, but that the termination of Mrs. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they feared that they could no longer believe her after that insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We're not racist," said her husband, Joel Plasco Post.
“But would you trust your child in someone you were rude to, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco compared the complaint to "exploitation" and stated that his wife had only cared for a two-month-old child and was in a very difficult situation.
"Would you like to drive like this?
That's not a nice thing at all," said the investment banker.
Even though the judge's over is still going on, the jury on the social media judged two people very quickly for their behavior and logic.
The storytellers of the bear Paddington were afraid that readers did not identify themselves with the talking bear, the latest reports showed.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, told the reporter: “It is difficult to feel the situation of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very fun to know now that we already know the great success of Paddington's bear."
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before being inspired to write the little bear's children's book, was very disappointed that his work had been refused, added a book on the 60th anniversary, which became a "sweet" dot after his death last year.
To Paddington, described as "a very important member of her family", she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quiet man, never at all indiscriminate," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was as if you had a child who achieved something you can really be proud of.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success with that look.
Even though it was his only creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his achievements only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louise Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors were trying to save her life.
“He called me regularly to let me know that it was really wrong and that he didn’t expect her to get out of it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I had to call from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say good-bye to her.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart on the move slowly lost her effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or yell because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is already grieving the loss of her daughter, entered the plane together with the other passengers without revealing what a difficult test is going on.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head shut, all the time running down my faces with tears.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the summer that I felt an amazing understanding of Nadda.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how powerful he loved her."
Saddening women send postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones as a result of suicide cooperate to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending a postcard to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can look for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, died in his 18th birthday.
"I don't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said her son was given a young cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could brighten every room."
However, before his death, he left his job because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014 Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his cousin's still body after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says, “I am still afraid of what this will do to his life.”
Ms. Davis proposed a survey to “in order to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and who can talk to them even if it is about their friends.
Don't shut up – you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a young friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who was her 15th partner shortly after his mother died.
"Nothing told me that she was feeling low or depressed, nothing at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Day – when the children opened the presents, and didn't look at them, nothing."
She said that her partner’s death was a huge trauma to them, but that it has to be achieved gradually: “This can be done in a family.
It broke us.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance of how the FBI starts its investigation
"I thought that we could get something that we really asked for - a time limit investigation, with limited scope - we could bring some unity into it," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "fall apart" because both sides would be buried after the partisan in the positions they had obtained.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The elections in the middle of the election period are only five weeks away from us on 6 November, and if the Republicans misappropriately expect, this will lead to their fundamental weakening in their attempts to place the man they requested to post at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush phoned the senators, robbed them of the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and met with his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI compiles his report?
The Senate will vote on this and there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear, however, whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate can receive at least 50 votes, which has enabled Vice-President Mike Pence to break the resignation and confirm at the Supreme Court.
The numbers of refugees from North Korea for Kim have declined
The numbers of refugees from North to South Korea have decreased since the beginning of the Kim Chong-Un government seven years ago, South Korean legislators claim.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Union Ministry, stated that in the last year there were 1127 refugees – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further stated that there is a need for stricter controls at the borders between North Korea and China and higher rates of required passports at the borders.
Phjongang has not issued a public statement.
The vast majority of refugees from the North today receive an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Soul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China with the longest North Korea border and it is easier to cross it than in a difficult protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China portrays refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still in war - have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the leaders of both countries met in Phjongang for talks that focused on halted denuclearization negotiations.
This resulted in a historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on the extensive conditions of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the United States of not making any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no way of allowing ourselves to be disarmed unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in his speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a " hysterical" and said she was unfit for service at the Supreme Court
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh a " hysterical" and stated that because of her temperament, she was unfit for the service of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not help myself, but if any woman had performed such a theatre, they would call it " hysterical," Pelosís said in his reaction to Kavanaugh's fourth statement before the Senate Judicial Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all the charges that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still in puberty.
During his introduction, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and squealing during the discussion about his family and his years at high school.
He also expressly condemned the democrats in the committee and stated that their accusations against him were "gross and coordinated attack" organised liberals who could not pass through Hillary Clinton's loss in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was incapable of working with the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was prejudicial to the democrats.
"I think he has been disqualified by these statements himself and by the way he relied on the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi replied negatively to the question whether she would try to appeal to Kavanaugh in the event of his confirmation, even though the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will tell you this – if he does not tell Congress the truth, then he is not only eligible for work at the Supreme Court, but also at the court he is currently working on,” said Pelosí.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the appeal of the D.C. District Court.
Pelosí added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the potential benefits of Kavanaugh in the Law on Acceptable Care or Roe vs. Wade because it was considered a conservative judge.
As part of his previous confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the answer to the question whether he would return some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There's no time for a hysterical, pre-connected person to come to court and expect us to just say "Jējes, it's beautiful," said Pelosí.
And women have to rule it.
After verbal defeats, months, and years of shelter, she was unable to escape without crying.
"We cry when we have a temper," Mrs Steinem told me about 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “The woman who was working with me somewhere and who told me that she was crying, too, but who had developed a certain technique, which means that when she had an argument and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘ Maybe you think I’m crying, because I’m sad.
But I'm in a mood."
But that's how she kept on doing it.
And I think it's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of responding to anger, partly because they are not understood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job where I worked in an office where men dominated.
"Never tell them you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in a non-marriage affair on board the Monkey Business ship and had to get off the battle. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a good-thinking decision," she said with a smile after 30 years.
“There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and seven puppies."
Since the campaign had been running for a long time, she was unable to take the step of making contributions and thus committed herself to not going to the fight unless she won the two million USD contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give it $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as a expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to obtain money and focus on the voters rather than on the delegates and the rebellion against sexualism, that she was completely choked by excitement.
"You might think I was nervous," said Mrs. Schroeder about how she reacted to the press.
“And maybe you would think that my main sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking what they might write me on the tombstone.
"Weeping"?"
Why can the Chinese-American commercial war be good for Beijing
The initial salvage of the trade war between the US and China was deafening and, although the battle is not far feared, according to experts, the gap between countries has been long-term beneficial to Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning this year by expressing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most significant escalations, however, have seen the world light this week, when new tariffs for goods of USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion) were declared, which is essentially a half-tax of Chinese exports to the USA.
Beijing has responded every time, with the latest tariff reduction of between five and ten per cent of American imports of 60 billion goods.
China has tried to pay the United States the same coin, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would kneel down.
Even though China would like Washington to return to its original colleges, it would mean abdicating its requirements, but publicizing American requirements would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si Čin-Pching.
Even so, experts believe that if Beijing was able to play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact is that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would put economic derailment in both countries. This is much more dangerous than the observers have allowed so far," said Abigail Grace, a research collaborator focusing on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into a normal state.
All conditions for voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual stated that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in the construction of a devastated country.
However, he stressed that we would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe responded sharply to the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field on the edge of the difficulty in France.
The United States has now lost its sixth in European soil, so it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points needed for the defeat of the US.
The United States star, Phil Mickelson, who played most of the tour, then fired the ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16 holes and let Francesco Molinari win.
The Italian golfer Molinari then flashed into all his wheels and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 European team players with the lowest score, Thorborn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most respected player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who carefully graduated his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the best European player with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help today.
It's been a tough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, really happy that I got the cup back.
It's all about the team, I'm glad I could help," said Garcia after Europe's victory.
He gave a cup to his countryman John Ramp, who defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel the incredible pride that I beat Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now scored a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder Cup.
The strange statistics of one of the best players of all times who won 14 biggest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend trying to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a peak golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States told his team: “I was really proud of the boys.
This morning we really warmed up Europe.
We really couldn't do it.
I'm putting a hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
