A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of persons killed by fraud.
In addition, only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States have been reported by the Republican lawyers in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments have since 2009 enacted new laws making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon was widespread after the November 2010 elections, which included 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced during the year 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification card and an evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to vote as an elector on the day of the vote and withdraw citizens who have their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
India was the first State to make such a claim.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities were forced to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored billing in 34 States to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, aged 21 million, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required identity card with photos.
That's good.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with a photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same States authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to submit such a requirement.
Since 2011, dozens of States have passed laws requiring voters to prove themselves to be American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit the Spanish vote.
However, it is clear that two Spanish voters out of three favour the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the voter's day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of some 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other States aimed at reducing the voting period by advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the voters represented only 13 per cent of the voters in the State.
He was going with the Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in anticipation.
On the other hand, the whites representing 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requesting the presentation of a photo identity card.
However, the new rules introduced will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democrat critics denounce the biased nature of the laws that have been passed and see this as an obvious goal to influence results in key States in 2012.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer testing: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positives, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more reluctant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In United States studies, there was much contamination among the groups of witnesses, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there is a difference in mortality between patients who have had a screening and those who have not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more chances of having metastases if not depressed.
So I recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are insensitive.
The patient must really understand the degree of risk of cancer by offering him the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by choosing, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be advised to exercise active surveillance and if the disease progresses, they will be given treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are precisely determined.
So I recommend that I pass the test anyway.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to assess for and against the APS test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokeswoman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a huge night for people's health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments André Beaulieu.
Encouragement: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying of a cancer falls by half.
The weight
Embossing and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," he added.
Food
The Agency also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of reaching a colorectal cancer.
Carcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salination may result in the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," we explained.
Vitamins
Over the last few years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established anymore.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and family backgrounds.
"To pass a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs Bounce Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boon created a whole emo, last summer, and for reasons.
It is believed that this boon participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it's still not quite sure it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we have an authentic new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boot predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still no data to be perfectly certain of it.
Let's suppose it's Higgs anyway, because the chances of cheating seem to be fake, and let's see what this is about.
In this lower world, there is a law that is fatally immeasurable that two things cannot be found at the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it also appears that it has such a law: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantimal state" - this "state" consisting of a large mode in some of their characteristics.
From there, the physicists classify the particles in two categories.
In a sense, there are good citizens named farmers, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other, the boons, a filthy band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can be beautiful and well located in the same place at the same time.
These bogs are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the meisons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of strength", by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the bog of Higgs would somehow be related.
These boons, we need to stress here, are not all so exotic as to be believed.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's thanks to an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disasters" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, a little like a cauliflower thrown into a pond.
Of this "disaster" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, or of infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the buttons "force carriers".
Champ plus stable
It goes the same with the Higgs Boon, but this is another field, the Higgs field, which has to be "disturbed" to make that boon appear.
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energy, a little as if it were a frozen pond with only a very large rock that could climb the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circuit ring! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all particles, nor all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on a cold.
And likewise, it is not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (such as photon, tins) do not.
Now, what "can bring" all this research, does Mrs. Plamondon ask?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to make any distinction between the observations and predictions of the MS.
They are also more than eager to find them, because the least difference could open a door on a "physical new" and close some of the Model's holes.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous weaknesses, offering no explanation for the gravity (up!) or the dark matter, which constitutes about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-up!).
But we haven't found such a gap in the CERN so far.
Effects
The implications of these research in the daily newspaper of Mr. and Mrs. All-the-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such thing.
Here: At the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers, in Bell Laboratories, did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would start.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already been told by physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - at the beginning the laser was rather seen as a "labo gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in perspective.
This sensor, although it was not entirely its original intention, now serves as "eye" to all the digital cameras of the world, and has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... . . The Devoir
With his Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly as a draft law is being prepared.
However, in this key area, much remains to be done.
The duty has tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monterégie.
The prostate cancer that had torn him had left him a two-year-old relapse.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-breeding, lying in his bed at Victor-Gadbois' palliative care house in Beloeil, where the guard arrived.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease is doing its job: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilets alone, and even eating alone.
He's stuck in front of an appetizer's breakfast, and he's willing to let himself be helped to eat, rescinded.
Courage, he even smiles, speaks to the strangers around him, brings him his medications, offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"During our lives, we learn that a man is standing, " says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
" It depends on the person's ability " to accept regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place in the heart of this recession.
Patients entering Victor-Gadbois' palliative care house all suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
At this stage, "the team of doctors and nurses who surround them no longer perform so-called "curatives."
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die " conscious and stifled " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I no longer have any desires in life," she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She still looks forward to a last visit of her son from Italy in the coming days.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers are being promoted to care for the body and food aid.
It's palliative care, which we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we're all done dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the house doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At death, we will accept oral care to the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the daily.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it's his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
" We help people as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but do not look like them.
Next to a 93-year-old man who tastes his last family assembly in the court, well shut up in his ears while he is stuck in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois house arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, at the hospital or at home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great lack of Quebec health care that scares several palliative doctors into adopting a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by the summits of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circling to witness their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients don't ask for death just because they don't receive adequate care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists are on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she left for proven chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me I was done!
No All-Power Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who claim to die are grateful to the caregivers for not accessing their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it should be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often resorted to palliative sedation, which returns to sleep until the patient died, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanasia me," that means "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible through a journalism scholarship of the Institutes of Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials on the road, BTP contractors, political party fund collectors and specialists from the Italian mafia tell us every day what they know about a huge "system", mixing the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafios.
A " industry " that cost Québec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been depleted since we took the great means," irony Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former Montréal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, by means of a thorough investigation into the abuses related to road work contracts in Quebec, to which only Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest of the time had consented.
The "Dutchneau report" established a direct link between industry, hidden funding of parties and corruption of officials.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, does he point out that the only transport department would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some are refuting their instincts to reach a quota!
The Carbonneau Commission "has already made two mayors fall", he adds, hoping that it will "demonstrate the strategies behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also deals with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More policemen from the "Marteau Escoude" who, since 2009, would have led the "cartel des úuts" in Montreal to put the soft pedal on the inflations of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has been conducting serial investigations and has brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal electors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city of Banlieu.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having bottled repeatable wine pots in exchange for public contracts.
They are formally accused by engineers on the road to Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the committee the mechanism of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montréal for years to an intermediary related to the mafia that returned the money to Montréal Union, mayor Gerald Tremblay's party.
Mr. Zambito seeded all winds in the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 to provincial parties (about €68,000), especially to the Liberals then in power.
He also reportedly organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Liberal Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Equitation contracts with costs
In Montreal, the corruption system was operating roundly.
Gilles Surprising, a former civil engineer, told the commission in detail: in ten years, he received gift building companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and pots of wine, totaling $736,000, in exchange for bail contracts with him.
Other road officials have reportedly fattened their legs by swallowing 30% to 40% of the bills, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned from Montréal in early November in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montréal's first electors to pull the alarm bell.
Mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, east of the island, has been invading the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and sold again... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of the money is wasted in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, it says that it "puts on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by forks, to stop the gangrene and evaporate the falsifiers".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
We're cleaning the wound, but we're going to need an investigation unit in Montréal, and a guard, so we can't see any suspicious practices back.
Like we do the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "workers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially concerned about the role of "elects in the course of the strategy", when they did not stumble in the bag!
Estimates 70% of the amount of money that is wasted in the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he is ironic: "It was said that it was only a pole that reflected reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100, but this will not change the donation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit electoral expenditure, there will be bad money in politics."
He proposed a complete revision of the public procurement and party financing system: "We cannot go further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow the house to be rebuilt on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story draws the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who dare to look at it in their own court...
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you took a new big deal with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
We can explain it by taking individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I'm moving in with them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in match, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the foot.
But I don't burn myself.
From my beginnings in the preforming center of the INF Clairefontaine to my transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by step.
So you benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Also, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He was shouldered by assistants like Claude Makelle, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, it is not equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He had a great experience and won many titles with hip clubs.
He has sided with big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
That's when I got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What is your view of the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still on the run.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we are qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we will have a word to say against very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a large European short-term club?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and join in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In League 1, wouldn't winning the title, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really have a heart to beat this title as a champion.
Last season, we haven't gone far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, has made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Although the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media are waiting for too much of the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us in view of what has been invested and players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it's certainly a bit frustrating.
We wonder what more people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put a game project in place.
A team is built over time.
We have proved in the League of Champions that we could respond to the present.
Look at Manchester City that has not been able to qualify for the 8th finals for two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
With regard to the amounts invested, you could imagine with 15 points forward to the pot!
It was to neglect our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up carrying it.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's holdings.
The better we say there's a Zlatan dependency.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very effective and that he sets many goals.
He came here for this and proved he's the star of League 1.
He proved everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is really remarkable.
This moves others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you live in the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Like a disappointment.
I was about to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from picking up on the game time.
I saw things over there, and I got out of there.
Today, I'm able to make good selection matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and today we must have exemplary behaviour.
What is your view of the first months of Didier Deshamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the Qualification Group for the World.
The selector is rigorous, close to players, and inspires profit.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deshamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good zero (1-1) rooted in Spain on October 16th a founding match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's been fighting for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
On the contrary, current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, transactions identified and processing costs among stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of paired files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a 30-dollar (EUR 23) summit in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today to around a dozen dollars (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global trade in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credit" used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
But every time, a central authority controls and deals with trades.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are both depositors of the book of accounts, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two email addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to make sure that the swapped bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched on computers, and the winner, such as a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file selection phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "make" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a special print (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it's good.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, for fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other left orpheline because the two have different prints.
The computer that solved the challenge gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
So the number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by up to 100 million, which leaves the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also seen in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already been high and low.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The error used does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Weight players such as Wikipedia refuse to give such gifts.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "great balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a teaching book on this currency, believes much about the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus less expensive.
The carrier manages his identity more and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in traders, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just have to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that there are thousands of users.
There is a general movement to refer to hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also plans to reassess the various risks currently considered high in the event of the success of this currency.
We're parts of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Otan and Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army took possession of its territory and that the Afghans chose their future, without waiting for us.
These are, in particular, the Afghan peasants we punished by viewing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who deny the presence of foreign armed forces, such as the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerable, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, will be no longer when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the high hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, took place in order.
The convoys of trucks and firefighters joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban deferling on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistibly advanced from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their taking control of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurity of these peasants who are outnumbered by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved in modern times.
Former Mujahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They moved to business, using government land to resell them in lands to build refugees from Iran and Pakistan, receiving huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to enjoy American widths: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have sided the modern world in their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
Work will have to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurity of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are friends of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish sheets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered as legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the position of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the April 2014 elections.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been abandoned, no dams are in place, no important irrigation systems are repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country that has been ruined for 30 years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth.
This has only added to the feeling that the West were only there to deal with it.
Without energy to treat the iron or copper mine on site, nor any means of transport to export it across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Ms. Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to explore the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
It will also take a day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal reports.
The departure of the French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new Co-operation Treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' school, boys' school, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "get the hearts and minds" and to accomplish the task of bringing together aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" by the Ministry of Defence (Cymic), abolished in 2012, led, and led to the success of a small French NGO, numerous work of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, local handicraft gourmets, was able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and growing crops.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, very hard in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above altitude.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests from small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection by foreign groups, what farmers have told me to do, it would be necessary for them to maintain a small, well-controlled, and direct civilian aid.
A Constitution at the Force in Egypt
This is a new poker blow by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives it full powers, it has decided to play its part.
In the short run, he announced, on Wednesday, that the Constituent Assembly would vote in favour of its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given this Assembly two additional months to complete his work.
Soon, two years ago, Egypt, based on a provisional text, repeatedly amended what weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President persevered in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "tratify his word" and to "peet the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that it is a means of ending the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short time span that compels the brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way of finding popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge is being angered throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Since this use of a hasty vote is of the utmost importance to the Egyptian people: "Whether you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers," they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, a large Islamic majority, voted yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, thinking they had not been able to make their views clear.
The same had been done by representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, replacement members, were added to the hunt yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Some commentators have also been amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day is expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee feel that the pendulum of the constituent was badly regulated.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, article 2 remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of the charia are the main source of the law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, would hope to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a joke of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the Liberals answer, who see only a single blow of communication.
Because according to them, Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which confers an advisory role on Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws with the Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because "the people who have spoken are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premiers of a theocracy."
In addition, the fears of the Liberals are attested to by the fact that the next director of this university should be much less modest than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Olémas, but academics, for some educated in the French system" Tempera Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be ambiguity around section 220, because the terms employed lend to the religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic case law, etc.].
And in the future, the question could be to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce themselves."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very critical because of the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced in comparison with what they were under the old regime.
Another issue: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defence Budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national Defence Council.
Civil proceedings in military courts, as requested by human rights associations, will not be prohibited.
They also share their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticid.
Blasphemy crime is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which may have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
Moreover, there is no longer any objection to the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on TV last night, events were scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the head of state will be displayed on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a sea of samurai await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argumenty i facty has taken five major reasons to make you into Israel.
Go Worshiping the Holy Places
Make yourselves uncircumcised: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who penetrates these "baptism funds" will be touched by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fish was miraculous.
It is in this particular place that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But where you find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
The believers traveled the Rue de la Suffrance or the path of Croix (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the fortress Antonia (the prefecture), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the place of the Peter of the Onction and the burial.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is erected in the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations which represents the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave little words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC. J-C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineers can go there by their own means.
For others, a telephony takes them on this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
Ski trails are 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to live on the top of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
I can't visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting who really are worth the round.
First, the Israeli Museum near Knesset (Parliament).
It covers the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel-Aviv Museum of Art.
There are mainly pictures of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha is waiting for you with its Turkish baths composed of massages of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Rally Museum where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or memories.
Entrance is free and gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which comes back to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memory, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter a total darkness.
Scenting stars.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major beach stations of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each one offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: You can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can bathe in it all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The blue water contains the flavor and very easily retains the swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are a surrealist beauty.
This is done to treat saltwater, lemon, curative cows and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also to just relax.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquities
They are kept by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It's said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young married people who come to take photos of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to sail in the Roman theater, "conquering" the fortress of the crusades.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourist note
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily interchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As far as urban transport is concerned, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tramway and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost a underground funicular.
The route in all modes of transport together costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes during 1:30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activities.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only cashher food, which excludes pork, sea fruits, unscathed fish and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
It offers a wide range of lamb and cattle-based dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, but also humous, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, mullus fish balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-nourished cats that thrive on the high air.
They can be seen sleeping on the roofs of the car parked.
These felines like passing places and do not refuse to be regulated.
The rental of a car varies from $37 per 24 hour (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entry to the museum costs on average 30 centuries.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest in the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists went to Earth Promise January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in 2010, before visas were cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"What language does it go to Moscow?": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are arguing about what the law on compulsory language testing will provide, fraudsters who sell "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and provides that every migrant worker must undergo a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and retail sales.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, and tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, the knowledge of the language will need to be validated, but also the knowledge of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate its knowledge of Russian languages in order to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only Russian nationals are exempt from the status of official language.
Persons who have obtained prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not covered by this Act.
Benefits, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Puchkine, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the University of Moscow State, the University of St. Petersburg State and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Douma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will this give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, they respond to representatives of the migrant service, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery to work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the Russian Federal Migration Service Office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in a crowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tortured for months without food and without paper and will have to spend between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken their passport, and they do not touch the scheduled salary," says Tolib Charipov, Head of Migration Services Directorate for the work of Tajikistan's Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many members of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn money in Russia are confident that they not only know the language of the country where they want to go, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow, would it not be just a passable primary education?
Indeed, their families don't even have what to feed their children without talking about getting them dressed properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adulthood, these young people start making money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when we don't know the language, trust them.
"You're feeling down and down."
However, human rights defenders have noted an important aspect of the law on language.
The examinations will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without a statute, there will be no formal examination or subsequent work.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defend to come in"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and still these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the cost of legalization is between 12 and 16 miles of rubles.
And then we can get a false record quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we don't have registration, from where the cases of extortion are.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," said Oumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajikistann citizen.
"Do fast, don't let go and buy yourself a nice piece of art."
As of the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsified papers come out of a regular printer.
Of course, their new owners had nothing to do with them: every migrant who expected to do so had to pay seven thousand rubles for the document.
It is twice as expensive as the official procedure: it will cost the worker three thousand rubles.
The human rights representatives and defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is not possible simply to buy these "paper bags".
The authorities may provide migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active contact with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes that the law be tightened against the holders of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: the shootings at the weddings or the killings organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who committed seven deaths.
The police want to ban the port of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the arms port permit from 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would soon be introduced to the Douma of State.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "locking the visa".
An open letter appears on the Net, in which its authors, representatives from various shooting centres, demand to abandon "this foolish hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, according to Russian service Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to the Department of the Interior statistics, for a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, today we can find any weapon in Moscow for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market for weapons is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five, according to Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the District.
Screenshot taken from an arms command site
The first is "the military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of weapons from the black market is those that are torn down by law enforcement criminals.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen in police stockpiles and those destroyed directly to law enforcement officials.
The illegal guns have been sold since the military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often suffered explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that certain fires have been set in motion to defuse the deficit," explains the former military.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are for something.
"We see private-weapon plants that do not compete with competition on the international market and run weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," one expert said.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important part of guns and guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyz.
"There is a local production, sometimes handicraft, a mafia has formed and organized the supply," adds the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was made in 2011 by the Problem Analysis and Study Centre for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data on weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the army and the forces of the order.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found "because of the employees whose work is related to weapons", the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from military conflicts, 14% were stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% came from "hidden sheets".
A salesman and consultant for an armourery who has requested to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by those experts from the clandestine dig; they are too old.
Most often, he said, sellers will search for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a teaching unit, such as a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the merchandise through a grill.
"He transports it into town and sells it back to 900 € by unit with two chargers," he relates.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be cleared, it conducts a control purchase with illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
" Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and the buyer are usually found by means of knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to the Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to walk.
The price of the gun, we gave it to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets in Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explain to the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but that's where we have to come by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American punctures with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives it to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Small new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schematics, according to him, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I believed in a luxury shop," the military remembers.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try anything.
As a potential client, I'm not happy to buy, we go with the forest vendor and set a target.
"You let me shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop since its sofa
The search engines display the sites and groups on Vkontakte where we can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for any document and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," it's posted on the website "Buying a gun or a gun for combat".
Users leave their request and ask questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Unlicensed, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (orthograph preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of false sites and has brought to the skin people who wish to buy weapons of war.
People turn to food like hungry wolves and then they use coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard about this type of scheme: Generally, the site is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic borders.
"He receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a gun", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without weapons and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of false sites and has brought to the skin people who wish to buy weapons of war.
"People cry out for food like hungry wolves and then they turn to exploit coal in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimated by experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Association "Right to a gun", we can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It comes from long-term deposits by the management of these medium-sized deposits.
According to the Department's official data, compared to January-October 2011, the number of these crimes decreased in Russia as a whole by 7 per cent and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of the theft and extermination of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs dropped by 7.8%.
United States: fast-food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has been set up against low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to take off or quickly sink.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left associations.
In parallel to the increase in modest wages received by basic employees at Walmart and in fast-renewal chains, event organizers want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the "Black Friday", when a dissipating rain of balances flowing out of millions of people fell on America and sometimes started to shine.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who work in the world for 2.2 million people, left their position to organize strike picks with trade unions and left-wing activists in society's stores whose products are intended for modest and medium-sized consumers.
Walmart commercialises everything: layers of hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8 to 27% less expensive than in large supermarkets.
That is why many poorly paid employees at Walmart run their race only at their place of work.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart may be able to sell its products in a good market, particularly because of low wages from its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifts or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" events demanded an increase in wages, they complained that the company's medical insurance price had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic salary at Walmart that reaches $9.5 per hour, it is an amount that cannot be allowed.
Scientists at Berkley University in California demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the salary increases to the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would make them 46 cents more.
They will only spend $1.39 in one year more than now.
Walmart's supporters noted with satisfaction that protests took place in only nine States and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued at the stores from 8am to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5000 items in this period.
Its cashiers have made a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
Dan Fogleman's spokesman assured an interview at the Huffington Post's left-hand side that Walmart's "less than five" employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com' operation among so many others" by the organizer's union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not related to Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet installed) but McDonald's and other good restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food increases them over time, but little by little, its basic employees reach New York $8.90 per hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me, living with this sum in New York is inconceivable.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about living with this salary and sometimes feeding their children with it.
On the other hand, there are comments on the Wall Street Journal forum saying it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald's on the 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also asked for trade unions to be established in the fast-renewal sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing Protestants from a trade union by means of bribery or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking care of fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that is for specific reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other disturbing demonstrations were held near several other fast restoration chains.
The fierce moment of the protest was the meeting in the middle of the day near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic politicians, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!"
The demonstrators were supported by other New Yorkers for the purpose, including the candidate for mayor Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we must all support the employees of the fast restoration to obtain a fair wage and economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast restoration sector in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not counting that they were not all fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is for the moment difficult to say whether this mass movement stick will make small ones.
"For the moment, we only get to misguide the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing the increased reality through special glasses.
At first, it was Google who revealed his current model this summer at his annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it turns out from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this society, the lenses are already from the old history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the naked air, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole remains for the moment at the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes at the touch.
We want to look at 5-10 years in front of us and guess the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the control by the gesture.
What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has become the physical interaction, many things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The availability of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the time being, is not really.
We're trying to change this and we're working on real 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of our world, in the physical world, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space surrounding him.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to start with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overrated?
It cannot be said that it is panacea: the issue of confidentiality is raised because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche.
For example, in order to command the equipment in public places, we had a project for which we were looking at gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is now large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pen?
You'd do it with the word and the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or cannot do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual reconciliation.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
These may include laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the present generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
Obviously it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind according to X and Y, but also Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave sensors a regular delay of between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone doesn't understand the extent to which this affects the interaction between man and machine.
I would need a device of this kind in my work, but not necessarily touching, to have more frames at second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect today has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a regular sensor of the visible field.
It does not serve to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the everyday use of increased reality technologies, lenses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transition" reality that would allow you from a cloudy platform to pass glasses on the smartphone.
The lenses are a very personal device and this is what makes their strength (the personal elements are those you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from the lenses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point their finger: there is no touch!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my course, I often say that increased reality is the seventh step in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could be very good at adding touch feelings.
For the time being, one of the most interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
She records the pressure perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed towards a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets on the hands that influence the nervous endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Does he make him feel what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below that will still have to be done for a long time: how to make someone physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of racing carpets (nothing to see with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the time being, it is only by means of deception of the brain that many years of work remain.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in absolute fecundation.
The kingdom of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersbourgeois Avant-garde" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, to the Avant-garde of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city's borders and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this man rather barbu, all reddish clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the connected parties and paintings.
Kirill Miller's tables always gather the crowds, whatever their place of exposure.
He is one of the land-based and philosophical Petersburg counters, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the Petersbourgeois avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and make them feel good.
He recently took in his hands an organ from Barberie and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, philosophy and image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you run the city all red and not yellow or turquoise?
- I've chosen the red as a specialist tailor in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Even in society, anything that is not gray is a source of aggression and a negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be painting?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I understood it was my way.
So the wave of old non-official paintings had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were not understood.
I began to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
And all that was found in your artistic clinic... it was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must meet.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which hosted a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Petersbourgeois bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Black and his friends sang easy songs in play-back in mollusks, among them Igor Vdovin, today's fashion composer.
When the group began to appear live, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg did not have much of a show before Hali Gali's time.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education, it was at our home that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboïedov": these are the effects of the Art Clinic.
Our employees left as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I've been named "Pinter of the Year," and that's when my reign is over.
It is not easy to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by an recognizable style.
- Many of my tables are hits, they have a very strong current and acuteity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to a time category.
Before I was a socialist, today it hurts and it scares me to be like this.
But with the clowns, everything goes away, the tragedy falls.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory decoupling.
Today, it is the home that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him his hand, but we need to hang him on the trunk.
And the lie will be wiped out by deception.
We've recently seen you in the role of the organ player in Barbara.
Who else can I play?
But maybe the art of commerce can also be beautiful?
- Today the art of commerce must be cared for, delicate, liqueur.
Deintegration of culture is under way.
Before, people were divided into troops, the bohemians loved one thing, the nias loved another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each one sees 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw out who come to see it, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and at the end of the account is less management, money, all desperate.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to ruin their lives.
When I was young, I was painting tables that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with tables that are usually those that are painted at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said that there is a spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and lived in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- From good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that good experts should be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are missing, because there is a need for higher experts who will properly assess these experts and break their path.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are paintings that need to be found in other museums.
- For you, what is Saint Petersburg?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In our home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art the way it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Hide in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate heating or collision with a killer asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with land on board are looking for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how do we continue to make our species live in a rudder or even on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be won, only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on March the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live here at very high altitude or on Venus orbit... in space.
We started to take an interest in reproduction issues in space by focusing on the flower.
A half century ago, experiments were made on plants.
Four generations of small fish grown on orbit were in no way different from land varieties.
Then we put on the orbit of insects, small reproductive drophilic flies.
In 1979, hatching eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed in the uterus.
We're getting a really normal pussy at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
" The problem is that the stomach must find support, put on its legs and begin to move," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
With no support, the ponds were disturbed.
And at the end of 10 a.m., the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
Poisons did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die at the end of four days.
"We shook their eyes twice, then left, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, finding the failure of the experience with dust in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
Experience will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only contain species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetuses in space.
In principle, we have not discovered anything supernatural.
"It was still biosatellite and then it's the only experience. We need to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
It's not a thin deal.
By losing their normal environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has the most precious.
Our moustache flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
" No one answered this question," explained Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, he may lose it.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during the flight in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, the heroes of the Soviet Union and the heroes of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
However, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: compulsory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero floating capacity, the cosmonauts train at the extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the sink.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for nutrients, it is their real element.
The small amphibian men seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves for about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid of her mother's womb, it is easier for her to get used to water.
This is in principle logical because from birth to first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the swim instructor Marina Aksenova.
In one word, if for the child who has just been born the sucker is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
The muscles of the womb, the pool are rapidly atrophyd, the baby’s push capacity is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by relying on the boot simulators.
Of course, we can prepare for a shower in a special room, and the woman will be able to get it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress up a nurse like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled, totally disabled child," says Igor Pestov, Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will go into their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the home of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institute of Public Finance Control) stated: "The control of the pseudo-labour independent (Czech " Szvarc system ") has failed due to politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is in the process of applying it.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Higher Public Finance Control Institute, said in an interview for Aktuální.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair, and, in my opinion, it is what is wrong with us," Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
Joint control by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
It cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Schwarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that ODS was not going to import contractors with controls; is this allowed or forbidden?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so even if it prohibits something, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect for compliance with the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project, which compared the public procurement legislation of the two countries.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public markets and specific national legislation, as well as a practice that follows.
We have gathered all of this, and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have emerged: in general speaking, our legislation may be "more stringent and better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is best in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project do for you in particular, and what is the result for you?
A common control of this kind should precisely contribute to our decision to try to clarify the laws, reduce and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a very positive effect.
The principle of good management means to obtain the matter at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and any criminal activity.
However, by lowering the thresholds of markets, this objective will not be achieved.
It may be that this system is so submerged by paperwork that those looking for fault will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
In the case of institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrecengnungshof is operating there, which is organized similarly, it also has a somewhat different council, but these two institutions are essentially proceeding in a similar manner.
Competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has courses on this type of accounts at the level of the various Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the State's resources.
The public funds managed by our regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of Länder's accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often designated as a model but certainly cannot be said to do better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage to cooperate with our institution, would they?
As regards national legislation, what did the amendment of the Public Markets Act mean to you as an institution already have its effects?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do post-control, we have to deal with a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "risk detection of bad management" with which we have made almost 14,000 public markets available - there will certainly be a sense of these changes, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law, rather than an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulation regime, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) obliged controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the Markets Act meant a lack of budgetary discipline.
Is it really helpful, then, to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but do not punish those who make formal errors without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution to get out of it?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that ODS was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Schwarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority from inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He may declare, "We will change the law and allow it," but he cannot say that we will act as if it was nothing.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, and that is precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic for a bidder to be eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, it is what is wrong with us.
The roads are frozen, but most remain practical.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains largely practical, in some places with increased surveillance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practical this morning, but also by frozen and snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and oscillate between -5° and -10°C but should slightly rise in the day.
Snowfalls have stopped in the region and only a fine snow layer remains in the plains.
However, the crests of the metallic mountains (Krušné hory) are covered by about 30 centimeters of snow.
There are data from the regional road maintenance service that due to the fog, visibility was reduced.
The rapid route R6 and the national roads in the region are now practical without difficulties.
However, monitoring remains to be done, for example on certain bridges where the coating can be frozen and melted.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practical.
It still remains on some of their sections of frozen snow residue and by places taxed by traffic.
In high altitude areas, drivers must strengthen their surveillance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Directorate of Roads and Highways reports on its website that some of the roads of East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of verglas and that traffic-taxed snow layers can be found on the roads in mountainous and altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of vertebrate formation in the high altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be verglas in the vicinity of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Myto, and this, mainly on the departmental roads and third category.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were treated chemically.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoshe) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlicí mountain).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnu and Trutnov, a traffic-taxed snowboard is present on the roads in the high altitude areas.
In East Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, most often cleared, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3° and + 1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practical, although there is a need for increased monitoring and adaptation to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures rise between -3° and -9°C.
After the last snowfall and the following cooling, certain communication routes may be frozen places.
Drivers can expect to pass through fog areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what comes from the information provided by the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is practically easy to operate, but the maintenance services of road communications recommend increased monitoring between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coverage of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-South and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental and third-class roads are wet and in this case the ice-cold protection applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, particularly on the less frequent roads of the Shumava region.
Region of Olomouc
The drivers arriving in the high altitude areas of the Olomouc region today have to rely on a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remains on the col says "Chervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment.
Snowfalls forced road maintenance staff to go to the ground that night; according to the road service, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the floors are easy to use.
" On the heights of the district of Šumperk there are snow residues.
Jeseník's drivers must expect to meet at the "Chervenohorské sedlo" col., a layer of thick and soft snow, today at ČTK, the head of the Šumperk district road maintenance services.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also took place during the night; according to the latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easy to use, but in the district of Šternberk the drivers should be careful in sections in forest areas with wet standing shoes.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
Since this morning, several difficult sections have been reported by the North Bohemia Road Maintenance Services.
There is evidence from the police that, in addition to certain snow or verglas covered areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, so snow and vergla should stay on the roads. In the plains, especially south-east of the central plateau of Bohemia, there is no problem, and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, including around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow during the day, cleared sky and ice during the night.
There are also difficult conditions on national road 13 between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec from the main traffic routes.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of the snow to reach the floor.
Šimon Ornest said: " In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those new alarms, the kind of trap we like to fall into.
In our The Tap Tap group, we are the only group that is able to collect a rest of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you have a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced on 21 December at 11 a.m.
On 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost as soon as the Maya calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, and then we designed everything with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters has also recorded a hymn against the end of the world, which is called " End of the Canceled World " (Czech " Konec wyta zrušeno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it be understood during these charity concerts?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in the three concerts.
Hymnes will also meet at a given time in the context of an on-line, completely unique broadcast of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X and also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities, because we organize many concerts and charity events...
We are trying to make them participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it makes them fun.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studio training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working on within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Jedlichkov Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to courses, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several music groups and interpreters will be on stage during each of these concerts?
What criteria do you have to choose?
We have tried to develop a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will be on stage Chinaski, Lesbiens Support, Illustrateosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here too, we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the home of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks at first.
We have five electric chair members whose tools must travel suddenly, of course we also have a lot of luggage and tool boxes....
So far everything has always been more or less well, ČSA and British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, and they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything happened without problems.
Through your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What has been your experience so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we have just witnessed in Moscow that it is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common that a person moves alone in an electric chair in the centre of the city.
They still do not consider it an evidence of giving priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there, too, an association that is trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What else do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements still depend on the efforts made by the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with heavy disabilities to move only into public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not even very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather opposite to the point of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
For the time being, it is only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what led you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play saxophone, among others), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Ládźa Angelovic says, we have lost some control of the situation (laughing).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
True, creating connections with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group has helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the bottom.
Thanks to the grants from the European Union, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Would you like to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it is logical: everything that is new is carefully accepted and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I can say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally mercy, it is natural ...
But mercy is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, who we must take for mercy.
These are people who can live a whole life and expand, provided they have the necessary means of living.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it is not only an advance for them but for the whole society.
Is it not also because you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to the repetitions twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Un seul, Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come in and out, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or wish to join us.
This will be the case on Thursday, December 20, 2012, from 2 p.m. to the end of the world.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relays when the song of the "End of the Canceled World" group The Tap Tap is sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to raise financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional Studio training centre located in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the ticket is free for children up to 12 years old, the ticket advance is open in Bohemiaicket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the Countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and had participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
Poland's road to space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, the passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde book entitled " Introduction to Astronautics " .
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the cold audiences and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelteria and André Louis Hirsch in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
This doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) subsequently became a great advocate of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagandist of the world-renowned astronaut, and his contribution has been rewarded, among other things, by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters on the hidden face of the Moon.
From 1925 a train was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is not clear whether the fuse should be used to drive or brake the drain.
The only information known about this drain is that of the press of the day.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.
Research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It is evident from the documents retained that this research had reached the stage of the tests.
Of course, with the arrival of the German army, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a photo-electric hunting rifle, drawn by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda poietrzza i rakietombomba lotnicza" by a author named Leviwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all drafts for the use of fusion technology were carried out by the provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukowy Committee"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautische Astronautische Society.
For the first time, it is a matter of a company in the November 1954 issue of the Problem magazine, which contains four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowiczze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronomy
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research was in the future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronaut Federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimier Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronaut Federation.
He kept his job until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the crowned development of the RM Meteorological Fusion (Rakeita Meteorologicalzna), which became the first Polish Fusion to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1,800-metre gap had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Then an improved version, RM-1A, and, during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 flight tests began in the Bledov desert.
This fuse had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to do concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963 all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 Fusion was developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM-type Fusions.
It was designed with two floors and had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of machinery was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the Aeronautics Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later should be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in the space exploration of artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut.
The repeal of the Public Utility Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Law on Public Utility.
This decision raised a lively discussion in the public opinion.
There is no doubt that it is interesting to examine this problem from a broader point of view.
Economic systems aimed at liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the various economic entities as well as national economic systems are permanently at odds with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital associated with a distorted financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the wage (wage) price generate tension over prices.
The following meaning should be put forward: a producer strives to import low-priced goods to resist economic competition by "making the price of the competitor more expensive" in order to remove a larger part of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to transfer production abroad, or to buy at low prices, or to disappear. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore responsible for the unemployment it generates, the social burden of the State is necessarily increasing.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect bad will of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is of such public concern that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create in different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments place their own population at the credit of private capital, regardless of the social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to existing laws.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the dictation of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of employees' rights in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been years of public food distribution points for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is obliged to pay a supplement to achieve the minimum vitality.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all Member States of the south of the EU certainly create a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live with wages of poverty, on the side of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their countries.
The question here is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come any more, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media state that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, which leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory intervention.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern the entire state according to its own selfish interests.
The answer to this question is certainly yes.
Evidence is that there is an almost omnipotent lobby in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual advantages, in legislation, where everything is punishable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate the development of bills to industry-related law firms.
These bills are then adopted at the Bundestag.
The whole of power comes not from the people, as the Western constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracy towards liberalism is now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompeii": "The state has long been in full decline and the functions have been attributed to violence.
The beatings of pot-de-wine, the illegal favor, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
Under-tables and corruption spread without limits, and the people went to the elections with voices already sold" ... ... "The honest people did not seek any functions, it resulted once the state remained unconsulted for 8 months."... "It was really beginning to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos had the Pompeii spirit, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absoluteist regime.
In conclusion, as in the past, the current company is based on the preference of personal profit, regardless of the interest of the company as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and make use of the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today, as in the past, a decade of unprecedented elites, without any effort to reform in depth.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the liberalization without scruples of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems can be regarded as a kind of break before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Utility Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and at the internal European level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systematic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen investment in state capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of the private capital monopoly in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and will never be able," says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main turning point is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my son didn't want war, there wouldn't be war," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her deathbed in 1849.
As a result of the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have arisen.
Some take the Israeli party, arguing about its right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling for the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; summarily, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a view "backside the curtain" on the one that mainly enjoys tensions that have been lost for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others come from my own understanding of it, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to someone who directed their actions according to pre-defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when global wealth is concentrated between the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that generates some powers has not been able to do so in one generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the rock (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
It's not written about them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s, they have acquired the first World Press Agency (Reuters) to put an end to the relationship between their name and the serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries where they have not yet had such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq by 5, after the return of Kadafi only 4, while Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank status of the Bank of America at Rothschild and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I understand well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was murdered in 1963, and MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to try a trial against the Fed for launching the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a three-world war plan by Albert Pike, a 33rd-degree freeman, with the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, particularly British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a number of slaves are sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and eventually acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order by chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an exacerbation of the situation (see the creation of the FED to avoid repeated crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After successfully launching the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, the successor of Habsburg to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the bite of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
To facilitate the launch of the second world war, the bankers left the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed far-reaching war repairs on Germany, thus generating the conditions for radicalization of depleted masses (they then had to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the hands of the culprits, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the fifth column of duty (which it actually does look like) to set fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the basis for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on the one hand and on the other.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held it; or if everything he did was planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps creates the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war repairs imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the State of Israel's foundation has lit up a fire house that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers are able to launch this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people divide sharply between partisans and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong generates another wrong according to an endless circle of violence and where, at the origin of all, is the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the world?
There is a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like us, international bankers only offer people elections to their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascinating politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything in his power to launch a war with Iran, who, due to his country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) could expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Ormuz Strait, which transits 20% of the world's oil (this ship corridor has a width of only 2 thousand) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is used by the rest of the human population.
A world in which all new births are implanted at birth an electronic chip making it completely controlled.
" Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to wear a red iron mark on their hand or face, so that they cannot buy or sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of its name.
It must be understood: that he who has the right sense takes into account the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number denotes the man and is six hundred and sixty-six."
The Argo movie: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators composed of Islamic students took over the American Embassy in Tehran and detained 52 diplomats in hostages.
They had to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, and it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had resulted from the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, later compounded by the failure of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States sparks a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iran feeling.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by the actor and performer Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory in America.
Just before she's occupied, six employees leave the embassy.
After complicated peripecies, they were found in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA manages to get them out of Iran through a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tour team who came to make some sights for a big show of science fiction.
Combination of genres
The expert's plan in exfiltration Tony Mendez requires Hollywood collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company with real offices.
The details of the operation remained long secret, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several kinds.
This is part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper motion", the story of a successful stroke, a betrayal - as in Oceania's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
Ambients follow: Documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the sub-titled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of the events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been retraced in the film, there are no major differences),
smaller Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with regular men discussing the situation around the conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to relaunch his career in a remarkable way.
Ridiculed actor, he became a respected stager and his actor's game ceased to raise ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long-track after the police shadow " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of a place's atmosphere is one of the features that put its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also proves this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests confusion and unpredictableness that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Tehran Basar).
Too many actions in too many locations
The stager must have contented himself with a subject offering in fact only a few palpative scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It turns out well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the crisis threat at Tehran airport is removed by a telephone call in America and the pursuit on the landing track is sufficiently pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness is in its dissipated nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperatives, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and that they are not, far away, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it is shown with moderate interest, appreciating the achievements and retro style of the 1970s.
He's training the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of another story, in a certain way, incomplete to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscience, he does the case.
Rules for swallowing balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts a public survey of the most absurd banking costs each year, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, recently, the adoption of a 40 per cent quota for the management of large European businesses has been at the root of our decision," said Právo, the organizer of this survey, Patrick Naker.
Among the absurdities mentioned are, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can tell by the end of the year any other idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Naker said.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio-components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively low amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the ban on the use of the term "butter to brew" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional ampoules.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (and the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, due to the fact that bananas in the Union should not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "unnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising national non-homogeneous standards that complicated trade.
The rules on fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives resulted in food waste.
The first price may be determined in this investigation by the EU Regulation last year, according to which a warning must be displayed on the balloons indicating that children under 8 years of age should not be swallowed without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to an American survey that the balloons are, among the toys, the first cause of child deaths by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age for breathing in oven trumpets.
We also have strange ideas.
The following rule on European officials themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic to Greece, anyone with an official EU function cannot use the name "Macedonian" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Laissez Faire" association of liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server appointed in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and risks a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey considered it interesting to pay money to some countries because they did not have access to the sea and to grant a subsidy to apply for grants.
However, these ideas are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea has a disability.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund."In autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) expressed himself.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and following the purchases of the so-called "interventionists", the State had met with full stocks which it had then had to export.
According to the Palace, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is away from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and made a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without sea access.
Grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which had to be used specifically for drawing up requests for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Birthless regulations are rare".
If regulations often make criticisms in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and in the area of its general development are worthy of praise.
More serious, for example, is the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic must, like other countries of the Union, fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the fight against which it does not always win) gives rise to lively emotions in the Czech people.
If, after six years of fighting against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tróžky", as regards the name "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to our home in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only canned sugar-based products, not beet sugar, may bear the name of rum.
The official list of EU registered products is currently available in a global cheese company such as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the Lübeck massepain or the Jambon de Parme, the Karlovy Vary cookies ("Karlovarské suchary"), the Carpes de Pohorëlice et de Třebonů ("Pohorëlicý a Třéboný kappr") and the Žatec hublon ("Žatecký chmel").
The bread of epice de Pardubice ("Pardubicý perník") and the cakes called "Cornets de Horíce" ("horícíque tubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm not just an amateur, Senator Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how did we come up with the idea of presenting to the presidential elections?
It's not about being a senator or president who counts for me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been robbed since the last twenty years, that thieves are not under the locks and taxes and the age of retirement is increasing.
I didn't have the ambition of becoming a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to make a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or senatorial elections.
You have entered the Senate but you have quickly set out for the Château (N.d.T.: Chair).
Don't you turn your back on those who chose you?
I've always said I'm going to throw myself into the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections
Subsequently, I stated that if I had been elected senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is just an instrument that enables me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we go to the bar or to our television station, but that we also ask everyone who is trying to make a change.
This is added to the press that breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
We have, for example, said that I am suing journalists or that I have been the advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and tax returns beyond twenty million [of the CZK] as a knight.
To that end, you have to change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a citizen, I have put pressure on tourism activities to be a liberal profession, and I have gained cause.
The problem is politics: when someone comes to the left or to the right with a good project, it is firmly rejected and delays citizens.
As an independent member of any party, I have much more chance of obtaining the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of taking from each party what is best for our country and implementing it without categorization and bias.
You think you're right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel that people are putting me on the left rather than on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we were going ahead.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that they gather people.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS, and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal purpose and a vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call this populism, but all the proposals I speak of have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken of them.
But without Parliament's support, you have only slogans left.
You will not survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have another option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast directly to television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Then they should possibly explain why they don't want to.
When there is a strong personality that identifies abuse, it will be possible to pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President to direct suffrage, which was obtained by pressure from the public.
I don't care about being an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just launched myself into politics and I am trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm just trying to move things forward, and if it doesn't work out, I'm gonna stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that only one person can't make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also present themselves to the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud in the massacre.
I've introduced myself because people are really unhappy, but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did most gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have chosen a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Do you plan to set up your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is pointless and then I don't have the financial resources.
I don't have any more money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I love about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
As I said, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a boyfriend's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in the car, was fighting with women and fighting evil and abuse.
You're in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million-dollar heritage and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I go to bed?
I've already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not of great interest.
I have no obligation to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign costs are globally covered by the remuneration I will receive as senator.
But I couldn't live on it, like paying my son's English school for 30 grand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not present myself to any election.
So you're going to continue your business to live?
Didn't you say you'd put your business in the background?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the direction of the travel agency in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would put an end to my business.

The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be sure, it is enough to contemplate Spijkennies and the mountain of newly erected books - 2 photos
"I find that this building is funny, it makes very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the street's bottom, tells us.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large neighboring company, tells us, "Yes, it's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone on the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one else goes his own free will in one of these praised libraries, right?
Spijkennies, a town with nothing to attract to the doors of Rotterdam, has a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls displays the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give some neurons back to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictitious tips that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small concrete miniatures painted.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city's authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of the statistics: the construction of a library!
Wine Maas, of the Rotterdam MVRDV architects' office, master of audacious boat charts and creator of buildings full of mind and often cynical, accepted the project with its usual flag and presented it to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a crack on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, confused and uplifting their shoulders, Maas, the faced one, packed his books of choice by size to make a pyramid, and ended his supported speech of activist arguments by one: "Dear common!"
Here's my proposal for the Spijkennies Book Mountain, or, as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain has a plot of land.
The building is included in a revitalization project, including a underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and mytoyan houses for a total of 50 rooms.
At the beginning of November, the bookstore received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this small young bourgeois, which has so far had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a majeure of an adorable laity, whose white faces invite to think that they cover a dairy, has been enriched with contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkennies now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you dig the ground of the building to discover its topography.
The interior is fully made of glass is bright and clear, the floor in Dutch bricks and the elegant reverberates speak without any doubt the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public banks, dogs and small boys and girls playing at the ball.
And all the books, books and more.
"Normally, the library beams are located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely disturbed the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the bookstore was properly furnished: the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environment centre and the technical centre of the building are located in the middle.
A particular beauty lies in the black beams of the library, which are both Lambris, balustrades, and ladder ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hard building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project to the municipality of Spijkennies, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in an agricultural firm ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, it has been used for years in the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thick as a substrate in the locks and fields.
It's a good market, and we'll get it from time to time.
The membrane finish is used for one or two seasons and can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, both of which evokes a new car and sports shoes.
On top of the 105 marches is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary cafe offers a stunning view of the city, as well as Dutch croquets and pot-ficuses.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute mainly to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Donations for the New Soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model environmental project," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only lights up for a short time inside, even the days of good weather.
The thick wooden poles mounted across from the glass facade serve as a parasol, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated stores are loaded from the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic informatic, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, describes even the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkennies.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to make a donation from his personal library.
This measure has made it possible to fill the library gaps that were not yet fully garnished (now it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays flow everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the masterly discipline that is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkennies wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of the Palestinians to obtain observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, however, without being overly critical of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also opted for abstention during the vote on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposes this measure.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to withdraw from a policy so as to say as defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
Thus, the Germans meet on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still trying to find this role, but they're on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What exactly does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt independent positions of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect Germany's position towards the conflict in the Middle East and the withdrawal of the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important openings in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to give public opinion, but also to the elites of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt that this is a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not just a unilateral relationship.
But this is a determining element in the German strategic reflections.
Does Germany interfere with its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, views on the Palestinian initiative are different.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly demonstrates a great understanding of the European position.
But given the country's political configuration, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I think that the real differences of opinion are not so big that they always seem to be.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from being enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things any easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
They cannot therefore join a wider political line and must affirm their unique position.
That is what they are currently doing in the euro area.
In my view, Germany will play a role as a locomotive in the future and will encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But I think the Germans are well aware that they have to play a role that is more marked by their independence.
Does Germany play a role as a player in the international scene, does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or does it still have difficulties in taking on the leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties in playing a more important role.
Looking at, for example, the euro crisis, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, this is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the U.S. influence on European policy only diminishes, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this gap, while who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're just less appreciated, that's life!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are famous brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trade mark officially deposited in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand thus enjoys protection such as the company that bears its name cannot complain.
And even if she could, it's not certain she'd get a cause.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, attorney at Taylor Wessing's office specializing in the violation of property law in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives at my office.
The simulators only need a few additional letters to be able to record their marks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copying the sports goods manufacturer, such as Puma.
Pattloch opens a classroom in which the records are made at the Beijing Trade Marks Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by fitting part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese have become champions in the world of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several-storey malls that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his mandate is to attack the Chinese trade mark office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say there is nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweet, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge."
Financial losses and justice costs are estimated at millions for the sectors concerned, particularly in the case of expensive light products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third global luxury product market and the most rapidly developing market.
However, it is not easy to delete suspicious registrations of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the result is never certain.
Pattloch reports the proceedings in which the court rejected the complaint, since after a long period, the criticised name became "the reality of the market".
Pattloch tells us that if the complainant has no chance, he may even be forced to pay money to the beach because he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that prevails.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the Sany construction machine manufacturer, the same company that had just purchased the Putzmeister concrete pump manufacturer.
That is why the Chinese can use a symbol similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo buyer, used before a blue and white logo that recalled the BMW logo. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the beaches of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the view of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that it had some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have passed last year on a "emergency situation in work progress to a found normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, representing an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain in the office.
Act cheaply
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal brands, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each registration reported on average EUR 1,280 yuan, or EUR 160.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese beach.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain a suspension of the illicit manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the simulator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wenzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munichese.
Freudenberg has certainly won a cause against the two following instances, but the adverse party continues to fight to this day.
Monitoring is underway
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, trialsome and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the actions of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed to the opposing party a "large sum of six euro" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see that represents for us," Wenzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to spread to Europe.
This would be the case if copyists in this region would ensure the operation of unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit the name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "watch is on the move".
Pattloch and advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to be proud of international trademark law, that foreigners should "record everything that is likely to be protected in China as well," says Wenzler.
Otherwise, costs can be much more important than those of registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay the adverse party licence rights for the use of his own name, as explained by Wenzler.
Or then we will lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: tapping, singing, helping
The Imbongi choral repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of the Swaziland AIDS enjoy their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that breaks much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, the foot is tapped: cowboy boots, basketballs, women's socks and men's moccasins are looking for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers are slowly amplified - high, low, tenor and soprano - and they stand up, stick up and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra manager almost loses his leather shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of a wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the choral Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years old came from human medicine to man in the home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choreographer has different words, everything in a very exotic language: the zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some regions of Swaziland.
Helping to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 orphans from the village's village of Esitje have found patrons in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, we can become sponsors.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means "counter of stories" or "singer of praise".
No one can often speak the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choral repeats songs in this foreign language that she has brought to Germany to now return it to her native region: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg Bird Flight, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esiteni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40 per cent of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or land huts, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has brought their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the evils afflicting Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, yet a measure that ensures a proven reduction in the risk of half-infection.
More than 40% of the population in Swaziland is infected with immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. Imbongis saw a lot of children on the street where there was not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is no good prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who committed themselves to paying a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a warm meal every day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has been taking care of almost professional orphans of the Esitjeni AIDS.
Sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ISTs include syphilis, chlamydiae and bennorrhagia (or gonorrhea).
The common ISTs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis pox and gale belong to parasitic ISTs.
What are the main groups concerned?
Symphilis and bennorrhagia often appear in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contact between men is the origin of at least four syphilis cases in five reported cases in Germany.
In adult heterosexuals, Chlamydia-related infections, trichomonosis, candidiasis (fungal), bennorrhagia and human papilloma virus are sexually communicable diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, the three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25 years.
Moreover, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not obligatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases more than doubled in 10 years: the figure went from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess at the level of genital organs, urinary pain, whiteness, abdominal pain, and the appearance of buttons and glasses.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes from sex to sex should undergo regular examinations.
Most fast-dried ISTs can be cured and the late sequences can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, the donations, but especially the funds that harvest the chorus through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulated.
"All in all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitenie," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman who is sure of herself and who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well accommodated, in one of their grandparents, for example.
The gogos, that's what they call old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one else is welcomed to a safe place, in Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the support of the American organization for PSI health, the association organized a HIV screening test for many inhabitants.
This is not of itself, because even though the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
"Sida is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches sexuality."
It is quite curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These death penaltyd by the State, inter alia, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found at every corner of the street, added Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote a little cultural exchange, Imbongi chorus travels together every two or three years in South Africa and immerse themselves in songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people from the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in African is a sign of recognition that it not only generates good humour and joy, but sometimes it also causes a tear to a few red-handed border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esiteni, where the chorists visit their daughters.
Even though it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esiteni is well known in the valley of Ezulweni.
"Go to Esiteni, you will find light," the people there said.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometres on the flight of birds, back to Heidelberg, in front of these chorus who walk in the repeat room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The NASA Space Agency has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science" explain.
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that can go up to 20 meters.
Water is likely to come from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have destroyed Mercury.
However, no one links the discovery of water with the assumption of a life presence on the planet, explains the scientist in charge of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements of life occur in other regions of the solar system.
In spite of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet Naine Cérès.
As Pluto, orbiting around the Sun behind Neptune, Cérès is not considered to be a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by Telescope Spitzer shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars are blue and the pink points, the most difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the space of the universe.
Telescope Spitzer discovered this region where the stars are born, baptized "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopea, at 6,500 light years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flameblowing spark of a star as it died.
The beige circle is composed of elements designed by the star when it dies.
In the immense nebulous trifide, at 5,400 light-years of the Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
Telescope Spitzer photographed this galactic storage room.
The Pleiades, star lovers also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope places more emphasis on colors.
On this infrared photo, the Nebula of Helice, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years in the constellation of the Verseau.
His similarities with an earthly continent were worth the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular painting.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope have been able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any trace.
One of the largest and cleanest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the tent, photographs of spiral galaxies can become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifide in the Sagittarius constellation, at several thousand light-years.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trains divide the heart from the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the premises of a cosmic carbulage in the constellation of the Serpentaire: at 400 million light-years of the Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies rush each other, the collision is inevitable.
Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like the technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname as "austral fire wheel".
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the nebulae of Iris, in the constellation of Cépheus.
The fog is 1,400 light-years and consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This photo was produced from optical and radiographic clicks taken by different telescopes.
There you can see the circle composed of black holes that are located at 430 million light-years of Earth.
The space telescope photographed this group of baptized galaxies Arp 273 for NASA.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this fog lies the group of young stars the brightest of our Milky Way.
The celestial bear always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the nebulae of the Rosette, also constantly create young stars at 5,000 light-years of the Earth.
In this galaxy to the bright rays and penetrated from a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was made up of much of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrores each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Grand Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the South African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter also reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle.
Its particularity depends on its great light collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is approaching those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe looking for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo Radio Telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any owner of a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing to the calculation power of his machine.
View on the Southern European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can shed light on the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take any clicks before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They would build two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea's observatory, which observes the sky with Subaru and IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration enables you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been reading pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space by 2018 at the latest on board an Ariane 5.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope will have a mission to find light designed by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury is also covered by ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, because Message orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data have indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercure, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink daily from butter, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of worthy Bible patriarchs.
There's even a museum of longevity.

An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young to 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is a complete romance.
Around the many road tour operators, the small bus cahotes along forested hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh, about which we do not know much, is seen, if they do not speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and have a very longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not entirely agree with the landscape of the picturesque mountain.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, because the road has only one route.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku has become famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of luck in the world.
We can discover the life of around eight decades of Tallysh in the region that is over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here's my grandfather. He's 120 years old.
Still having a child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Şirali Müslümov would he have been fooled for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a generalist at the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, also heard about the man at the age of Central Asia.
"Surprisingly elderly people also live in certain regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of documents, regardless of the absence of a civil record.
Every day, a glass of deep butter
However, it is true that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years of age.
What, then, is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the museum's director, thinks it's a power issue.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that food rich in Talysh calories, which loves meat, bread and especially dairy products, and which often drink a deep butter glass daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the whole region of the Caucasus.
It sits on the ground next to a barn, where it beats the contents unleasably.
Eight people live here under one roof, one of the sons of Mirzayeva and one daughter, who have been adults for a long time.
Two small children are also gambading in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests serving in typical glass-shaped kitchens.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his crowd they hide long trunks of a dark blonde that his son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and they've kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," added Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
All my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst times were after World War II.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of the strange propaganda in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the nation's fatherly figure, a man who, however, led his country as a dictator, knew hardly any limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him afterwards.
Whatever the case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats per month (about the same amount as in euro) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And perhaps the son has been grinning from Mirzayeva for a long time: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human rights" neglected in the Constitution
The revolution renaissances in Cairo.
The country's deep fracture was revealed by rival demonstrations.
The Sharia-based draft constitution is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president has no words full of emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said to state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but especially to the Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims and laymen.
Because all the members of the confused and desperate opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy about the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, a doctorate at the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be reversed?
The 234 articles written in a hurry by the majority Islamic assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the project provides that the case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains an issue of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use vague formulation and the margin of legal manoeuvre resulting from it to apply a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
In any case, it gives rise to a new article that stipulates that, with regard to all topics relating to the charia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the country's most important Islamic institution and its outbreak spreads throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would in fact lead to the protection of the judiciary.
Many points in the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problem is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts used to oppress the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, if it is to be read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the State institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits insulting or defaming the prophet Muhammad or his messengers.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
All too dubious is the wording that makes it clear that it is forbidden to "injure people".
Is it enough to draw the president's caricature or to tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in Morsi's draft vote, which, according to his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians very soon.
"The Revolution Renouncing"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the charia before it enters into force.
"The revolution renaissances and we're going to win," Hamdin Sabbahi launches, the third to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize for Peace and Former Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he declares the referendum, we will go to his palace and reverse it," says Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet forgiven," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim conference called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was held before the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and the partisans of the Salafists, who participated in it in great numbers, scandalized: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an [was] their constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty in the symbolic city of Thair, where it begins, would soon have brought about a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had expressed themselves high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to allow the people to decide by the polls of the leadership to be taken by the country.
The Islamic project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this constitutional process imposed that should have extended until February and involve all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the Mubarak courts.
He did this not because he shared their concept of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was shot, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are offensive to the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto denies him all his powers," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels delayed, including by the international community, in view of the battle between the various political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A protestor on the Thair site warns: "You're in a monster that will no longer be able to control you."
Norway's raffisk: is it the most delicious fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway benefit from one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the rooms for an extremely smelling fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and salty footwear.
Wait a week.
And you get the annoying smell of raffisk, one of Norway's most popular bets.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 o'clock from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, impresses the air.
The raffisk consists of salt powdered and fermented in water for a period of time - according to the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to one year.
When the darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you pour a glass of water," says Harvard Halvarsen, a local full-time fireman who is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Surrounded by us, people take advantage of small pieces of fish and swallow a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer the aquarium to the rakfisk," Howard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid making it pass under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus.
The reef rises to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in air-tight water bars, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses reduced by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a full health system.
The Swedes, their ancient rivers whose country was not so richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Racfisk is considered something important, a vital element, though pleasing, of Norway's past.
This is based on the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small beer or sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to be regretted.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who beat 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they speak of "the incident of July 22nd."
The Norwegians find it hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them was able to commit such barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," explains Anna, our servant, to the blonde hair and to the eyes of a transparent blue, the image of the Nordic well-being, with a raffisk plate at hand.
We are -- as you say -- prudent people.
His English, like most people living here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything except a low percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw money out of the windows, during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the bonds of its stock exchange very close.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and make a date in the summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"Don't forget the raffisk," she adds in an unsuspecting laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I'm making the queue to buy me what to eat - I've had my raffisk dose.
On the menu, a hamburger made up of candles, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of many places where we use raffisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most delicious of them.
There's a TV show where the performer wears a nut-papillon, surrounded by raffisk seats.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughs and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of the water.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
While the incoming President, Enrique Pena Nieto, is preparing to take up his duties in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, he is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, who are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the present time.
In a city where the bottlenecks are legionate in normal time, a security barrier has been established since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential mandate to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is good, results due to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is facing a drug war that has already cost some 60,000 people six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before the US President was co-chaired, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and tentacular state that includes the capital. On its pre-election ground, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A straight man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the community.
To get to the city, you can take one of Mr. Pena Nieto's new highways, an important improvement has been made to these roads, sometimes jammed and full of crevases.
Plates bearing its name are attached outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to bring about lasting changes," said his political friend Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and party of Mr. Pena Nieto, PRI.
In terms of security and economy, among other things, we hope for a real change our country needs so much.
After 81 years without failure in power, the PRI was conquered in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of the opponents who accuse the new president of lack of charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent man of state and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
At Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the flat streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more striking.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military were called on to fight drug gangs in the neighborhood, and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a devastated area, the bodies of dozens of women killed during the last two years have been found on the land.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto said that he was best unable to address the problem of the murders committed against women when he was in office.
Worse still, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality face to face.
In a concrete house, typical of this torn neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports on a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came to her home, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the body stiffness had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana wears the wall, next to a cross where the word appears: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family refused.
The authorities treated me like I was an old commentator, a troublemaker, a complainer.
They want us to accept what they say and to take care of ourselves.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his discharge on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by the crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, that is exactly what Ciudad Neza's families fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment which Bradley Manning would have been the victim of during detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of breaking down thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the biggest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. Army -- had many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claimed to have suffered during his military detention.
During a counter-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein stated that no complaints regarding his treatment had been made during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The counter-question -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion demanding that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a severe enough punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his wish to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of having demolishing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning was their source.
During the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions to Manning and reported his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms, on Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had reserved for him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not state any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but did not report the problems.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet it did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee that met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "injury risk".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below the close monitoring for the risk of suicide -- for his protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted to withdraw this status... in order to gain a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before he was transferred to the military prison from the Corps des Marines base to Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and had disappeared once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not aware of what was going to happen to him or what was going to happen to him in the rest of the world was very worrying.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said, Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a cover, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or staying up during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also stated that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he came back at night, they would wake him up to see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was put in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked questions to Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stay naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time, he was not allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions, on Friday, Manning stated that he had withdrawn from the order of his guard that he was supposed to release his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but admitted that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked last night, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastics of his slip or tongs to hurt himself, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that at least the judge would take into account the experiences he had experienced during his detention and that he would significantly reduce his sentence if he had to be found guilty in court, a trial that should be held in the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that Manning plans to plead guilty of the least serious crimes and fight for the abandonment of other burdens that were considered too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all prisoners in Quantico.
Chiefs of prosecution against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, the collision with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the Chiefs of Prosecution are detained, he is indicting the criminal remand for life.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexicans are caught up between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), the other for the "foreigners" ("foreigners").
I've been in real estate for several seconds, not knowing which line I'm headed.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the Mexican all my life.
This is an ethnic character, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became "Mexico-American".
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that my grandfather saw born, there was no need for special qualification or union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to manage an interview in one language or another.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport, and I went to the foreign line.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama, the White House.
Generally, when leaders of these two countries meet, their pre-election themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans remain in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and to create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give half of their territory in writing to the point of the shooting.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
As a result, as soon as an U.S. official makes the least criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans attack the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the trunk.
Yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that of the country with more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the subject of love?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
In addition, we know that a part of the Mexican elite in the ruling class doesn't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defect and they warm us up as if we were individuals of lower descent and not enough Mexican descent.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relations with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves at the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexicans, because Mexicans are more strongly claiming their identity and Mexicans are opposed.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels that she is part of two countries.
In addition, many of the Mexican Americans I know do not have the impression of being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of intelligence want to get closer to Diaspora.
They want Mexicans to work as fortune ambassadors to Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We must explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a proud country that must absolutely visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much love.
And if we consider wage inequalities, corruption and drug violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, friends.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexicans still want them in the way their family members have been treated for so long.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Dear Old, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood transfusion seems to indicate that such hope is worthless.
While the same fictitious arguments persist, which began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, rockets drawn from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem trapped in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
In the Arab spring, everything has been stolen into cracks, and whether it is desired or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught by this regional disturbance.
Perhaps their struggle will be further intensified.
However, there is every reason to think that this could help them to get out of this mortal impasse.
A War That Does Not Lose or Gain
At first glance, it seems difficult to prove optimism.
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November remained, this week's fights strengthened the force's supporters on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will be tempted to force the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has been a dead end.
Having killed some of his leaders and repulsed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas wins from the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently under the hands of their Fatah Rivers, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power in full swing, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has also taken cause for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Members of Hamas are retiring and saying that the growing Islamist bends around Israel, from Lebanon, to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its rule, passing through Syria, where the rebels with Islamic tendencies can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the assembly of Muslim brothers under the leadership of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, from the most populous and most central of the Arab countries, changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily returned to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded from even Israel and America.
During this time, Israel's supporters will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was placed in a box.
The Iron Dome Baptized Missile Interception System proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears for a time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unbreakable support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the source of the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets of Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that strikes the West Bank, the main piece of what might be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish colonies that continue to spread despite their illegal international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud merged with an even more bellisticist party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman's approach to the January 22nd election, has a beautiful party.
Why do these Palestinian files rot by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's preferable to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of the way.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will take it; but the Arab spring may change it.
Even though Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpowers will not help the new Arab governments arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire that was of good cheer -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dust that is intended to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and democracy exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound the Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains that of the reasonable persons found on each side, and most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with an Israeli assignment of territory in exchange for security.
A short and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will give external persons the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now stop the movement of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama is also interested in Israel's acceptance of negotiations.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own plan of peace.
Returning to the White House, it seems also reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for packages of neutral cigarettes have entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is the first world, the logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since Saturday is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by eliminating any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26 years, there are 99% of the chances that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message carried by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia records the lowest tobacco rates in the world and although these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers stated that this would relaunch the black market trade, which would facilitate access to less expensive cigarettes.
"Dangerful consequences will come from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco Australia.
Falsifiers from China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others stated that this law had dynamized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarettes, particularly silicone to mask the horrific packaging, has greatly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost it in Australia's High Court.
Ha stated that Zico sold it to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only nuisance, experts say, is the popularity of the social media and the section of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsoring and the obligation for dealers to dissipate cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you have no more than a small glass to promote your products, the Internet is the unsurpassed place by excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who is suffering from a video attack, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that industry is focusing on the new regulation in force rather than marketing.
The industry has gone to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new justice decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the current year 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries about similar legislation on packaging.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
At present, these warnings are available in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you pack the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package containing a picture of a mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna stop is my little girl.
James Yu, managing the "King of the Pack Tobaccoist" in the center of Sydney, said that the uniformity of the packages made it difficult to arrange the packages on the shelves.
"Before, I needed an hour to download a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them for a good time and we would have said OK, that's good, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a world that is constantly connected, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
As a result, I have had enough time to reflect on the topic of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spend a half-day at an airport waiting for a flight is rather boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts who specialize in the development of the child commend the nuisance.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow interesting ways, even to feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly facing several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of the boredom.
Then should we welcome the nuisance with open arms?
Yes.
Not at all.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought the boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But that is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Board: A Levely History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes very far," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they rise up in the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and debated in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, an aggregate professor of psychology at York University, Ontario, Canada.
After passing through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the nuisance as an experience that is "to want to do something, but without being able to engage in a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not doing a task that she would like to do.
With apathy, he said, there's no desire to do anything.
What is in the heart of the boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a moody mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Nausea can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be connected, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we may think that we are bored when it comes to a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, its too high of a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the sound.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more upset than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or demanding task, a interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregate neuroscience professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "how to look at objects on a mount chain, music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he says, at present, we know that when we torture or scratch, these gestures, often considered as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigate learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain unmoved," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay in my flight, a speaker with a single voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "Scaling of Predisposition at Night" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have time to do anything."
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied incentives.
But in general, adolescents are quick to take offense.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today's pregnancy rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when the boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is the boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets, or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are referring to a link between boredom and creativity, Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what's the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-reliance, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulatory shifts from one situation to another," he says.
Your child does not just learn to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
As I do not think we should criticize it.
To feel at ease outside the constant bottlenecks that generate activities and technology is the goal to which we should look.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to get tired more often, but the boredom arouses an acute and frenzy desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way of disconnecting and appreciating stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulant," he added, "it's hard to find ways to throw ourselves into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new Marijuana Act
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, studying at a university and footballer in Colorado, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his condition: the possession of puppets of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found Marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to compare for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified immediately.
Police services have ceased to charge adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors who are in Colorado's more conservative districts have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to blame those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the Bennies of Denver to the mountains of the West are currently voting to prevent the opening of sales of marijuana approved by the State in their neighborhoods.
"Things are changing so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the Aurora police, east of Denver.
The Washington State regulators are also asking no questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a license system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the date of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is intended or not, is in advance of most of the regulations on marijuana, first of all with regard to the use for therapeutic purposes and now with regard to personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real past on which we could rely," he said.
The Washington Act, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a legal void of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical issues remain suspended: how to balance the state mandate that ensures proper access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or creek.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis sales trade, especially in the Metropolitan Zone of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Cannabis Law Center, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City of Atorney" (representative of the public ministry) would no longer pursue the 21-year-olds and more people with small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop accusing people of this kind of "immediate effect."
Chief Oates stated that the police would apply the new justice decisions regulating the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the district attorney (Republic Prosecutor), Ken Buck, incarnates a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with Marijuana-owned cases, mainly in order to pressure users to detox themselves.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are charged with other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to try to prosecute those people who committed an offence that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer compare adults to possess limited quantities.
The representative of the county public ministry, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all Marijuana detention cases immediately.
"I don't have the impression of wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and governmental framework for the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalentity among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents people accused of using marijuana and who speaks as the local spokesperson of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent much of their lives pursuing the justice of people who consumed marijuana, too, have trouble accepting that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to treat the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are about to become a case law for the legalization of drugs.
While the defenders and representatives of the State provide for a new border of legalized sales, they look forward with concern to the federal government's directives, which always design the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of Marijuana's legalization hoped that the Ministry of Justice would surrender.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police are probably not going to break down the doors to seize small drug bags, there is a strong bet that it opposes the approved sales of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Shortly before the vote, some local authorities approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even though this is only one year's delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a 6-month moratorium, and should impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to meet in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the State.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was badly damaged and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservator).
It is not only today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was a prominent place for me to know, a sort of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my bags, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were disappointed.
The newspaper of L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that first-cycle students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson stated with enthusiasm that I was part of the process after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I ran away because I was a victim of intimidation and was the subject of constant brilliance.
Not because of my different name or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this so-called war, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my sad father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conservative Party.
Why call it today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students is subject to the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is like last week, some of them have demanded protection of their rights as well as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the Students' Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want a representative within the University Committee for Equal Opportunities to be able to express their views freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary released on BBC Two "Wunderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Country of Miracles: Young, Intelligent and Right"), dedicated to the politics of students, and which identified the "Tories" as eccentrics and neonasists.
Among other things, it was discovered that student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (UCA), who moved to Rolls-Royce, made a full silver and moved with a chromed head cane.
In other universities, conservative students are said to be treated as emissaries of the introduction of increased school costs."
Luke Black, 20 years old, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, said to a Sunday newspaper "that there is a left-wing party growing in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, who studied history at the Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate was "inconvenient", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the OCA, said there was a deterioration in the attitude of the JCR members towards those who are centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate and the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one thinking about it during my first weeks in Oxford.
I came in in September 1986, when I was 18 and I was paralyzed.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted for the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the reception week, when the new students introduced themselves to others and teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasms against Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on child labour, privatisation and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was recorded in the classrooms.
The first sarcasm to which I was victim concerned a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man on his pussy face, was easily taken.
"Is that what the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends with you," he said with a greasy tone.
I'm back in my room, unconsolable.
During dinner tonight, I sat alone and felt a little tap on my shoulder.
He was a second year English student, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OAU.
"I know who you are," he said, politely.
I'm really afraid it's the way it is.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservator) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be harder for you.
Most Tory youth claim to be Labourers (workers).
Later, in the local pub, I tried hard to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with what Mrs Thatcher had said.
This strategy has failed.
A first year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students resumed the resurgence.
I was a pervert, you know.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I have just lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I become a Labourer and reject my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was an adviser to Thatcher's foreign policy and one of the authors of his speech.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his accession to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a post of professor at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started making the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelievable.
During his studies in Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreams.
Even my Communist friends had inexcusable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Let them have a chance.
I'm sure it's for your own good.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a work session conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested most seriously to the world that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
I have admitted to being the victim of my parents' brainwashing and "old crazy" treatment.
The rep was short-lived.
It's my father who buried the last key of my Oxford circle.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed stuck in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers left.
When they left, I made my bag and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me with pleurnichard wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such intimidation at a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, who not only produced 14 prime ministers Tory, but also benefited from an inexhaustible reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Courier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The Couturer recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-cut models created for his sewing house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the focal point of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, you will find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social promotion: from the modest tailor of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, to the icon of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving the kingdom.
"At least, they don't crack their cigarette bubbles on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular guest and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited in his Gstaad chalet," explains former female "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino
The Argentine mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charm of the tailor.
A few years ago, after a show on Place d'Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "model top", which started working with him during the High-Courture week in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go by fashion, because its creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobless Linen Show
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but shared love.
He loves well-known people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a 60-metre-wide glamour podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the mannequins place and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" of dreams carrying the main creations of Valentino, such as the size that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Nette", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
Among this public of mannequins are Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Courier in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentine's first clothes are like the first love, "unforgettable."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pantson, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a dress from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the Cousin Museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he subdues our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they're bright and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she brought a Valentine's model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening clothes...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Linene.
It was a red evening dress, with a wheeled shoe, a draped buster and a falling decoy.
"It was a dream become reality," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to the fashion, he is obsessed with the impotence," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the Couturer's evening clothes with "the greatest care, because a night's dress is not only a dress, it is also the whole of the memories she carries".
The "king" of the fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress during his marriage to Paul de Grece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the tailor calls them his tailors) to make this ivory silk dress with interspersing pearls, twelve kinds of different teeth and a four-and-a-half-metre train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high cost of the late twentieth century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnoxious for years by the "know-be" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Labouro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated by the Legion d'Honeur, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his well-being, and his perfect appearance have always jumped me in the eye," admits Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the paved stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by wearing the sulfur of the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas from the earth's cracks is solidified by air contact.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the sharp paths.
There is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which peaks at 2,386 meters high, but the worn-out carriers spend more than 40 minutes to record this distance, at a pitch of tortoise, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a fake could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who fell dead in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The Kawah Ijen minors earn 5 cents of euros for each kilo of extracted sulphur.
Once higher, it breaks a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and with painfully carrying the heavy carts, they walk 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has installed a little in opposite at 1,850 meters altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian clothes (5 cents Euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry at 10,000 rupees (83 cents) as it is very present in everyday life and is used to produce candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who generally makes three trips per day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.20) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167)," says the host who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job wasn't as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as undisputed as the suffering: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java for her conversion to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, he spent three of his life exposing the danger to Kawah lygen, but sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases cast by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a store or study the Spanish or French" he promises in an English language more than acceptable.
Misleading by life, this sympathetic and intelligent young person could be a tourist guide, a server or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unsalted wood mass with other bearers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning, as sulphur never ceases to yellow the night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defending the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp fixed to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur trays on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanismd the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their account and are paid to the weight.
Furthermore, they also do not touch one under 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.50) of magnification by camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.20), that the guards of this natural park bill tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corporate who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
He can carry up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his three sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from severe diseases... to which their usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in their knees and shoulders are obviously added, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the cart on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and he pulled 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 kilometres from there through a path of goats invaded by the bad herbs.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says by opening her mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The elderly of her five children, aged 30, also works as a sufferer.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery of generation in generation is one of the most difficult professions in the world: the one that makes the human mussels of the Kawah jen volcano.
Singapore search for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans place the responsibility of this absence of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, we fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem impeccable that these words come from advertising for menth pills, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video has spread like a powder train on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polychineal in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, stated that he wanted to use the power of music to fill people with their "national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt it was a theme that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a number of things such as throwing perfumes to the pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we have said this: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But it all had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, considered as the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have children anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage Policy and the Family of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"It has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the constitution of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a policy of immigration aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created a feeling within the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that have plenty of barely managed xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore has experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has a known impact on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that its "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than larger dwellings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasure.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to the promoters, who were put in the wheels in advance if they wanted to offer too little housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
As long as these new regulations can be a step towards an increase in the national birth rate, while discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people give it back later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," another 20-year-old tells us.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is the quality of the private domain or "the sphere of private life that we can protect from any interference".
What is the private domain for at least 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he exposes himself by spreading on the Internet events he would certainly not share online?
The newspaper elPeriodico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent screen users.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "password and username" when applying it to social networks.
"I will not disclose my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or someone who would make the fool," he said.
The young boy recognized that it was wrong to publish obscene photos, nude people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are from the family.
In part, her mother knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he added.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he said.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of José, 14 years old, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits that he does not know 20 people on his list of friends.
"That doesn't bother me because we have something in common, for example, music," he said.
According to the young boy, no one has made any progress or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I'd just delete them from my account," he admits.
José signed up to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that are known today as cyberharking are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was picked up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was" assures him.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just passed it on to a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even though I know it's cyberharking," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and licensed in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in education at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they are children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she said.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should be disclosed, published or said to an age where they do not have the necessary maturity to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective, while what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think about them.
"Their saying not to do it is useless," she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do that on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every minute?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"On the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be the same on social networks," she said.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and education adviser, states that it is essential that parents consciously read the terms and conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that they do not need to speak to strangers.
The UNAUR Summit ended without the release of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 current representatives.
Eff tried to access the document signed at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported that it would be released after the close of the summit and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian Government's website.
When they were questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief press statements.
Journalists' access to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio session" was broadcast in the press room.
The few information that was circulating among journalists was reported by the press links of some of the UNAUR governments attending your meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of present presidents, which caused a certain Malaysian situation among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that demanded more important information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd South American Summit of the Arab States (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was requested by the press, it had not also circulated the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited access to information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which is at the end of a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at your regional meeting and stated that they would respect the IJC's decision to hear the plaintiffs from both sides in Lima's trial against Santiago, which began in The Hague on Monday.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are facing today before this international court," said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," President Piñara added, giving President Humala a handhold next to the flags of the two countries.
The two Presidents' confirmation that they would submit to the IJC took place after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Covenant by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international court, following a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered to be a grave error.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug accessibility, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a crisis Europe, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should help to increase our productive matrix and to explore a better future for our populations," said President Humala.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the cross-roads of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide any further details.
The final document also mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its integration into the South American Union," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he was hoping to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, next Saturday in Mexico to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a IOC judgment requested by Bogotá.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua, which will ask for a discussion with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilised and respectful way possible," President Santos added.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to attend the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, within the framework of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of UNESCO, although the latter is suspended.
Peru ensures the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today stated that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take the example of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the United Nations Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "were interviewed during World War II" and other conflicts, "but they are now almost a country".
In this regard, it advocated the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unassur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there is still some reactionary areas that we want to be part of in the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President expressed his support for the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories to the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is under US funding in Washington," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assures us that he does not regret his decision because he did not betray his own principles, but on the contrary he respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were suspicions based on which Assange would be extradited to a third country and its proceedings would not be respected".
Moreover, he criticises the Swedish justice that demanded that he submit himself to an interrogation on a alleged sexual offence on his territory, while "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done since the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa claimed that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health was deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the embassy informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by being confined in a small space without being able to exercise freely.
"It acts on the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, which would be the allocation of a non-conductor that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is between the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stresses that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the nursing of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there were permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted the extra-conduct from tomorrow, it would end".
And if Sweden, as its legislation permits, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioned him through Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he would not tolerate was "the mediocritity, the bad faith and the lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil or wicked political men, but the bad journalists in the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he welcomed that it was not this kind of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward its reelection, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and pursue the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur until at least the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and attempted coup d'état" because, in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Furthermore, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the Hague International Court of Justice, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They need to be resolved as a whole to go beyond them and move forward.
At the same time, he said that he trusted in the correct resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders that opposed Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was "beneficiary for Latin America to take the international courts if the two countries agreed to accept a judgment as firm as it is".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to provide a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the primarys of February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved by means of political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we never forgive, I will.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I had just discussed with Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a rejection of President Chávez's health status," he commented.
The Head of State of Ecuador has today participated in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which has ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to a late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: seropositive.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it and his frustration was just as he had celebrated his 43rd anniversary.
He is no doubt one of the oldest HIV patients in Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), where he was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmat.
So, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided telling him to say goodbye "because he was without a voice".
Back then, having AIDS was a synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "expunged" their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV unit chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he claims that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva has commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immune system assignment that patients presented at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who receives a 25-year-old positive HIV diagnosis, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years," the researcher explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, we need to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has significantly decreased in recent years in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS follow-up has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (as reported by UNAIDS), it is also true that, since AIDS, 60% of the patients listed on the national database have died.
In Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In at least the last 12 years, we've never missed medication, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on global mortality, it is more early diagnostics and, for this, it is necessary to propose mass screening tests to all those requesting it."
The experts and members of the Council of State for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who are carrying out their screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his youth, he was already a AIDS carrier and suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I break up three times a week," they say, "that's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," relates Fabrizio, who agreed to share her intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to her testimony, those who are afraid of today, during the World AIDS Day march.
If they do the test, if they take risks, they will soon know if they are HIV positive and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who hugged the cause of HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms before we were given one or two, now we are given hundreds of packages, it is very good, but as a result, today, some still do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgements by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, assure the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold to the counters but be found in public toilet distributors and in places where young people attend.
This is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it any more about paying them girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had answered when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It is not like sexuality works, the best thing is to provide condoms to already sexually active people," he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in the number of new cases and cases accumulated of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contaminants are sexually transmitted, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it for each registered case.
A judgement ratified by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group through a trade failure in Mexico. The scenario causes a bad precedent for all national companies with branching in neighbouring countries and with problems of solvency.
It would therefore be said that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican law are not valid in the country at the starboard, in contravention of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup d'état rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Missiles for the northern district of Texas leaves Mexican companies without defence in view of the possibility of imposing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's main glass manufacturer to take possession of the United States Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case indicates that creditors must register under the United States Failures Act, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main proceedings are the formalized commercial failure in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law had been established to that end by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-company vote, recognized in the critical mass of the trade failure, the debts contracted by branches of Vitro to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are about half a dozen examples here, including Agrimex and Commercial Mexico, including the Federal Institute of Commercial Failures.
In addition, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any way the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the U.S. courts, i.e. the "empty" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
Data missing from the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without halting the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For the moment, the González Sada family will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to take place in full, that is, with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The appeal will require non-prosperity and require a review of the proceedings by a higher court, in which case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the curiae friend ("a friend of the Court") in which the proceedings followed by Vitro under the Trade Errors Act were detailed, noting that this would release him from the conventions signed by the two countries to bring him to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Trade Errors Act.
He also noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two sides: they take Vitro and they take over the country.
General budget
The complaints of the trade unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the company's former employer, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been silenced for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, and the Association of Air Pilots has already encountered problems.
The court, covered by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently refused to provide the Attorney General of the Republic with information on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw F/589 from bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares from the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're occupying the Dragon Mart
Meetings at the end of the week in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the large wall country, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East zone to oppose the monumental project that is partly in protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
The Government has put forward a request from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Contraface Trade Agreement, known under its English seal of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it has turned out that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is all my life"
The "Hetin" Reyes basketball ballooner spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, travelled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as big as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage does not condemn him to the wheelchair running in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
"I've been wearing several basketball helmets all my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes on a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind him of his journey out of standards, testify to this.
Bayamón in the Heart
Of all his memories, the ones he most loves are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vakuros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-managed or manager of the team.
"That was my best years, the ones that I enjoyed most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has led to many years of satisfaction, including the five champions who competed from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a major administrator, took the lead in the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been running here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a tough player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would have helped us try and win another one.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros Championship with Gauss, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manipulator of the Federation.
At that time, he would prefer to take advantage of his duties and Mincy's duties in the national team.
I recall when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympics tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not brought us back to our last match, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
It is among the best, as was the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we put a bullet in the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that had won the bronze during the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend the world of 90 due to a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitner in exchange for the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, it's Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In youth, I love Leo Ariel's work very much.
For you, what is your greatest success within the federation?
Being part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of the 1990s, BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would like to put in place, such as regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from the other corners of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the benefit of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch videos of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my little kids and, from time to time, I watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, which has always been on my side.
Actor Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born in Fort Worth, Texas, on September 21, 1931, became known worldwide for John Ross Ewing's main role, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarcerated a man of unscrupulous, reducible and manipulative business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate without scrupulous J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications of a cancer, according to a family communiqué sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., a production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his precious city of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved the most," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on the day of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted her wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, declared her press attachment, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and lived deep life," said Gray in a communiqué.
The doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized that he had had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and had suffered a seizure.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the "Jinny of My Dreams" series broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedys that remained for a short time in the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in cinema are the roles well received by the critic in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the delectable J.R. that Larry Hagman knows his greatest success.
The CBS series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around a full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among others, the series reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most popular entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was the beautiful sister of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatisfied man but with charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful wife who tried to get her alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take for J.R. to epitheliate," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "It's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as well as a man "immeasuring, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans all over the world, and in the heart of each and every one of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success on the TNT chain.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, the chain has informed.
At the moment, neither Warner nor the TNT chain have communicated how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who is famous for classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the New York theatre scenes in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where they live with many celebrities.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s impotent memoirs)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or hurt him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver strike, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist troubled patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to work and then," he relates in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it'll go well."
He was also a tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible slaughter there: the end of the "great countdown" of the Mayan calendar, December 21, to which many refer, as proof of the end of the coming world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was expected of him during the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax break that some have named "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time thought that the apocalypse would start.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were talking about it, it was a very good time.
And remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker provides the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios leads to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of History of Art and Anthropology, made a team to give a course, simply called "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final review will be carried out on the watch of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students any choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," said Restall.
The courses were fairly popular.
"It was completed in two hours," Restall said about its high-level student course, consisting of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, on the part of people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"This fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgeid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, says he's seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I like it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less a teacher, told us not to believe in the end of the world of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Maya prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," says Julie Zegel, last year's student at Temple, aged 21 and originally from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it is just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I believe that there is anxiety about apocalypsis in Western culture, rising to several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has provoked a wave of these speculations.
"In other parts of the globe, people don't think about it," he says.
It's mostly the Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who gave courses to the Philippines this year, responded quickly when he was asked if he knew that there were courses on "the end of the world" here.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that in the course of the years, many dates assumed in the last judgment have been discussed, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or philosophers on the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the light date.
Several told us they were thinking of going to parties "of the end of the world".
"Sometimes I call friends and we get along," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student in communication.
