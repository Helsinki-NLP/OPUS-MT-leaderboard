Members of the Galleries Assembly are concerned about "identifying them as Muppets."
Several members of the assembly expressed their condolences to the proposed amendment of their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This debate has taken root in the plan to change the name of the House by the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure can become a cause of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said he was concerned about the fact that MWP "refused with Twp or Pwp".
For readers who are not Gallese: In Gallese, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that the set of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh Conservative member said his group was "open" in front of the name change, but he also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it should be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the Assembly responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint members of the Assembly will, of course, come to the members themselves."
The Galileo Government Act 2017 gives the Assembly of Wales all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was called "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the "MWP" option was the one that received wider support in public consultation.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, but the attempt to reach a consensus may mean a total disgrace to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in the matter of weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their nomination during the debate on legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on the name change of their country
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change the name of their country by "Nordic Republic of Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time on the fact that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the efforts of this country to be part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, against the plebiscite on the change of name, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the change of name is just the price to be paid to become members of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's campaigns stop sounding: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the big people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church in each corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's none left of the two."
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he comments.
"The bars have already stopped being that kind of living rooms for the neighborhood where people were regularly there."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets doesn't last as long as its leaders "and that they return to the place from which they came."
The churches, in addition, could end up being replaced by apartments and condominiums with the kind of people who won't be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be of a white race," he says, "and so what they will do will accelerate the closure of all churches, as it is quite unlikely that most people moving to these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that was originally formed left during the 1930 ’ s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th street retailers, one of Harlem's main commercial streets, who resisted the contract or promotion of black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the congratulations of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they took over the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to the church of St. Martin's, described all the pride of the carriage as "the campaigns of the poor."
The expert who made the carriage sound the July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first carriage in the world that was played by a black-raced musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carriage of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What he has played in St. Martin's over the past few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them carried by the lay leaders of the church and others by the bishop diocese.
The council, the governing organ of the parish, formed by lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July while expressing its concern that the diocese "would intend to transfer costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contract of architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some happy people have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A bull hurt a 13-year-old boy while looking for lactating in California
A bull attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was drowning to look for lactating in California on the first day of the lactating season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel at the KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help, and then they stayed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was about the joy of having taken a loathing, but then he "saw that he was shouting 'I've been bitten!
They bit me!'
He had the whole key broken," observed Hammel when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone comes out of the water, I called out, 'There's a bull in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he was admitted to a serious state.
You don't know what kind of bull is responsible for the attack.
In a press release, succorist Larry Giles commented that he worked for a few weeks that had detected a bull in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed access to the beaches for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas due to research and security reasons.
Giles noticed that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK's beauty products market
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product passes in the style of large stores occupied with specialized employees.
These large passages are only part of a considerable investment in the beauty product market in the United Kingdom, a market that moves around GBP 2800 million and continues to grow as fashion and home products sectors remain behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more shops in the year ahead if the test is successful.
Investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their loans that were previously intended for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claim is that it will duplicate its beauty offer to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with areas of similar brands that can be found in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly sought by younger consumers.
The Minorist Chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores. The first one did so last week in Croydon, South London, while the second one will open to Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and changing into a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble large stores in an attempt at the supermarket chain to fight off Aldi and Lidl's discount supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos sales points to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch the sales of quays and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all came to an abrupt end by not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its business of 281 pharmacies in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands for leather, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our beauty product passes to improve the face environment for our customers.
We've invested in workers in specific formats that will be of great help in providing advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the favorite destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "hot" after Holly Willoughby is behind a 11 million GBP deal.
The Dragons' star Den Peter Jones left "fighting" after the TV shower Holly Willoughby made himself a deal of GBP 11 million with Jones' life-style brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to get involved in the joint home product business and True accessories.
The business of these two media characters was compared to the Goop brand in Gwynet Paltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons star' Den Peter Jones angry at withdrawing in the last minute from the lucrative life-style brand joint business to focus on his new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "urgent" when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the centre of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new agreements, worth GBP 1.5 million, meant that he would no longer have enough time to dedicate to the joint brand of home products and accessories True.
The business had come to compare with Gwynet Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce his departure from True, Jones took a private flight towards one of his holiday residences outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was far from Holly's top priority.
He was meant to be his long - term future and where we would see it during the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to get back left without words all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters ready to be sold."
According to experts, this morning's presentation, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company because of the important investment that had been made in products, from kitchens and lamps to household clothes, and the possibility of delaying its launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had kept a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president last March.
Both couples spend their vacations together, and Jones has 40 percent of Baldwin's TV producer's participation.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the program I'm A Celebrity of the ITV.
A source near Jones commented last night that "We will make no comment about his business."
Hard charges... "and then we fell in love"
He made fun of the possible criticisms received by the media to make a comment that some would consider "uninspected of a president" and to have such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did he give up Trump at the same time?
Trump said, making all the fuss about the voice of a news reporter:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first June in Singapore was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean High Diplomatic Ri Yong commented on it Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response" by the US for its country's first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare the war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now let's keep this great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results: ending tests with missiles, helping to free hostages and returning home to the rest of American soldiers.
And he defended his little usual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this neighborhood full of people, we'd have about 200," said Trump, all pointing out to the crowd that was in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds dead because of a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, required in advance to be able to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain that foreign people can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute at the time of offering assistance.
Given the constant stress that Indonesia is experiencing, the country is unfortunately not ready for the wrath of nature.
Although Aceh has been built shelters in case of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in case of tsunamis, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of Indonesian islands is, in the best of cases, a whole challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was caught in Lombok to deal with the victims of the earthquake is now heading for Paul; however, it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and had invested huge amounts of money in railways and roads.
However, Joko's government faces the year that comes to the reelection of funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative fall.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of street fights between Christian and Muslim gangs with knives, bows, and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored with a far-off jut in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the First League in front of Chelsea with his goal marked at the 89th Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 27 meters from Chelsea gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
The pilot was accommodated to the left before he let go of an incredible jut directed to the second suit.
The shooter crossed the whole area with a big raise as he pushed himself right across the gate.
The pilot finally started the descent above a Kepa Rizzabalaga in full jump to try to stop her and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge comments at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté was coming, I made a touch, and I didn't think much of it, I just dedicated myself to sit."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at rest after scored a goal at the 25th minute by her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the front of the Blue team returned a past to Mateo Kovacic before starting almost half the field and sprinting into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
Next, he made a magnificent past in depth, which he left at Hazard in the area with the controlled pilot.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish the second suit with a jut with his left leg where he couldn't reach the Liverpool porter Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet in Naples at the League of Champions group stage next Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for her part, will play Videoton at UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths for Indonesia's tsunamis is up to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho on a press wheel.
The city of Palu, of over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after finding a stabbed woman
The murder investigation started after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several gunmen in Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect of murder.
The police have asked the people in the area who have seen or heard anything about the crime that is being presented to the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan: "Although the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to make a call to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or felt anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially the taxi drivers who have been able to get anything through the car's camera, who get in touch, because they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman's body they found is Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigations continue, the police have commented that they are reporting the facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have told him no one has allowed in or out of the building.
When he learned what had happened, he lost his word.
He's warning residents that they'll spend hours until they can get back in.
He could feel like a police officer telling a man that the whole area is treated like the crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
I keep saying, "It's terrible!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were within the agreed area with another van parked outside.
A number of Roma officers within the agreed area controlled by the floor block.
Any person is asked to have information that he can send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers through 0800 555 111 and mention the issue 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of the British parliament was the last monument affected by the discussion about "rewrite history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the most pure-style destruction of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by their fanatical pure followers.
However, Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor that he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being commemorated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than not now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a completely accurate representation is a theme of historical debate.
What is true is that the middle-aged conflict of the 17th century was the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of this division.
His claims as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated."
A killer pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered with blood near a pig market in Liapanshui in Guizhou province, according to reports Sunday China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs into a farm in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
As far as we know, he had traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that he gave to a nearby pighouse.
According to the court, there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-pound shrimp had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had broken legs full of blood," said the cousin, of the surname "Wu," according to the news of Guiyang's evening.
Scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither property of Yuan nor of his cousin.
One of the market leaders commented on the evening news that the pig remained closed and isolated so as not to attack anyone else, while the police gathered the evidence on the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although very rare, there have been previous cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious wounds.
Ten years ago, a pig about 300 kg took a gallon farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't come up with the idea of doing harm.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve," he commented.
The remains of the Rosa Hurricane will bring torrential rains to the whole southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, the Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she moves on the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains all over the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States during the next few days.
Rosa had wind at 138 km/h, close to a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, U.S. east, and was located at 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving in the direction towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, she will start to leave a strong tropical humidity in the north-west of the United States.
Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate widespread torrential rains across the southwest during the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams, and the possibility of land slavery in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates near 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona.
There is a possibility that laughter is formed, since the situation is rapidly worsening because of the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrent rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers. In addition, storms can bring storms and dust clouds to concrete points.
The depression that is approaching will lead to torrential rains at certain points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to record total precipitation over 50 mm, which could cause lower waste streams and smooth roads.
It would be the first precipitation of the rainy season in the region.
They will begin to arrive alone in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the four corners region on Tuesday and will continue all over the Wednesday.
October will have several major temperature oscillations for all the U.S. as the Arctic cools down, although the tropics will remain very warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes in a short distance.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of almost 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the constant heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected that October will begin with heat in much of the Central and Eastern US, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the Southern Plans area to parts of the North-East.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, representing about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures are recorded above the average in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw on Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate to the Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, who allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a turn of events in the last minute: an agreement by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to the FBI to conduct a charge investigation for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in an elevated witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The audience numbers were not immediately available for other chains that forwarded the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the people he sees from his office.
Put it in perspective, it's a similar audience to that of an American football party or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders who have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most audience chain, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the day's witnessing, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest is kept high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate republican issued a statement saying they were voting in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was indicted by protesters when he tried to climb an elevator to go to a view of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake stayed several minutes with the look down while he was live on TV at the CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They told him 'you have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!'
Flake said his office had issued a communication and, before closing the elevator doors, commented he would have more to say in committee's view.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcasting chains were already streamlining live at the time when the Committee on Judicial Affairs had to vote whether or not to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate to vote.
Flake said, in return, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate allegations against the face-to-face nomination next week, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake was influenced, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized his plans to abandon the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and to disrespect national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU collect taxes is "absolutely absurd".
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU team player
Police have arrested a suspect for murdering Wayne Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was on the LSU team.
Diteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and sent to a second-degree charge of murder, according to Baton Rouge's police department.
The authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson.
Police recovered the glasses on the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to the WAFB CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to having killed Wayde in a shooting, according to the police.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Forensic Office of the East Baton Rouge District issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the neck.
The department thanks the State Police Operational Group Louisiana, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the area's citizens for the assistance they have provided in the investigation that has culminated in this detention.
The sports director of LSU Joe Aleva expressed his gratitude to the forces of the order of the area for his "diligence and for seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Average 1.98 m, he was playing the game and he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds from last season.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach commented that the team was "distorted" and that Wayde's death was "one very strong time."
"Things like this are those that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
A volcano asp ash in Mexico City
The ashes shot by Volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after the crater activity was detected and 183 gas and ashes emissions were recorded within a 24-hour period.
The center was overseeing a number of strips and tremors that had recently occurred.
Images on the social networks where a fine layer of ashes is appreciated in the car umbrellas in the neighborhoods of Mexico City like now Jochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the volcanic activity at 72 km south-east of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the referendum anniversary on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favour of independence faced the anti-avoidant police and thousands of people gathered at false protests to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its session.
A group of independent individuals detained by the anti-avoid police began to throw eggs and paint them in dust, which caused the appearance of dark dust clouds in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, there were beatings with the police, who used their fists to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, Don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters calling "Long Life in Spain."
Fourteen people had to be tortured for minor injuries during the protests, according to local sources.
The tensions have not diminished in this region of independent mentality a year after October 1st a referendum considered illegal for Madrid was held, but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, since the opposition to the session boycotted the vote mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote entering electoral colleges across the region, causing violent confrontations.
Independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration took place in the same way, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independent demonstration along with his wife, said he had little hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he commented.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although, on the other hand, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, since many of their main leaders are in a self-imposed or detained exile awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the police support demonstration with her phone, and said the conflict had been launched by politicians from both sides.
"Tension only increases," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house with a car
Three 33, 34 and 39-year-old men have been arrested after a car reinvests against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage to the doors and the same building was caused.
It's also possible, at some point, someone shot a bullet against the car.
A Menga game gives the victory to Livingstone for 1 to 0 in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston assumed victory
The Livingston, which this year had gone up by category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which everything is just the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as a coach of the Ibrox Bar Club.
Dolly Menga's game made the difference, since, with this victory, Gary Holt's team is in second position, sharing with the hibernian.
Gerrard's people, on the other hand, continue to win out of their home at the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they will be separated by a difference of eight points.
But before that, Rangers receive this Thursday's Vienna Rapid to Europe's League.
The Livingstone, meanwhile, expanded to six parties its intruder to the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what the defeat is since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingstone does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the visitors' direct game
Holt's team should have gone in front of the marker a long time before the target, since their direct game caused all kinds of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defenses, but he missed his chance when he found himself in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow sent the pilot outside to stretch himself to try to finish Craig Halkett's past, who crossed the gate.
It was good for the locals to let Rangers get close to their area, because they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated games.
And that's how this decisive goal came to be.
The archbishop yelled at a lack of Rangers' interests, and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined for Menga to play first and finish from the central part of the area.
So far, the Rangers had dominated possession, but he found himself with an impenetrable defense and a porter Liam Kelly who had very little work during the party,
The scene was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a farewell stop.
On his side, Rangers Allan McGregor stopped with his feet an occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up playing another liveston combination.
The Rangers were dedicated to hanging once and for all other pilots in the Livingston area, only to be rejected, and they were charged with two fines, one for a alleged Halkett entry to the Glenn Middleton replacement, and one for hands.
Livingstone "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they've been excellent, and they're still going beyond all expectations on this rising journey.
Their game style and staff have hardly changed since their return to the highest category, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt in the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immeasurably in charge of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worall had to be dependent on Menga throughout the party.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Although the brilliant moments with Gerrard as a coach have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create opportunities (only once they clearly overcome the local defense), and this Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Welcome to Erdogan in Cologne
They were all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
And it's that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police issued security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers flocked around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurdish, also felt as they condemned Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies meeting a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place close to Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. local.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedic services took care of the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a case of an accident with a runaway at Children Street, 1.6 km from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police have said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the nearest relatives.
The street has been cut down and diversions have been applied to bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six injured agents in an Altercat
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security prison, according to the center's office.
The facts occurred in Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still lasting.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, where eight prisoners were involved.
Agents had to be watched for minor injuries in the face instead of the facts.
According to a prison service spokesman: "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to solve a long Martin prison incident that still persists.
Six employees must have been injured.
We're not going to tolerate the violence in our prisons, we're sure that those in charge of this altercation will have to take care of the police and they might have to spend more time in the garage."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the Long Lartin prison centre, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison had to be found in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October of last year, anti-failing agents took action in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which the center's staff were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (the areas with even might be beneficial)
It's not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of the week that comes when what remains of the Hurricane Rosa passes through the south-west desert, with the consequent risk of rivers.
The national weather service has already issued alerts on Mondays and Tuesdays in West Arizona to the south-east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and that Monday night will be near.
Phoenix' national weather service commented on a pilada that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression on a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the national Hurricane Centre provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm were recorded in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rocks and the Great Conca, could be recorded from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are at risk from rivers, the rain of the Rose could become a very good news, since the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although rivers are a major cause of concern, some precipitation may be very beneficial, as the south-west region currently suffers from an even one.
According to the US drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers at least even extreme, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, the Rosa Hurricane will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes you lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with a tropical storm force either in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of rivers.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm".
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with a tropical storm force, before arriving at the Arizona border at the first hour of Tuesday morning with a tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach South Utah well entered on Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from Rosa or what remains of her is very strong precipitation in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-west desert of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Centre.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and streams of waste in the desert, in addition to land slavery in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshots in Somerset.
The adolescent was injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he's "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call so anyone who can have any kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone gets in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the misery and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection of the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered "machinosis and anger" from the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh declared before Congress on Thursday, refuting strongly and emotionally the accusation that Christine Blasey Ford had sexually abused her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also made a statement in the view in relation to his annex.
The president said Saturday that, that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and bravery."
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an amazing journey of service to citizenship," he commented to the many supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as referring to the importance of the Republican voter participation index in the mid-term elections.
"We are in five weeks of one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but I actually did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our big candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place as late as Friday, according to CNN an assistant of the Republican Party's leaders has informed.
Hundreds of deaths due to earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday on the basis of a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters struck the coast toward the end of the afternoon, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the threat for tsunami came yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and they didn't run away immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, who brought the BNPB Disaster Mitigation Agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, destroyed everything that was on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
Some people went up a tree running from the tsunami and could survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palau.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster relief agency where the number of destroyed shops and buildings, turned bridges and collapsed bridges is appreciated, and a mixed water.
Replicas continued to sabotage this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that energy released by the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the city's geographical characteristics, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were extradited.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the damage could increase on the coast to about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, closest to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came," says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross commented in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It is already a tragedy, which could unfortunately end much worse," he said.
The agency was strongly criticized Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In recording a shared fan on social networks, you can feel like a man standing on the top floor of a building gives desperate cries of warning to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of bursting water at the edge of the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami have caused a generalized cut of electricity supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuations continue to need food desperately, as well as other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths for Indonesia's tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very bad.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Donghala were able to arrive safely and safely in the city of Palu, where employees flocked to remote shelters installed in the yard of their office, during the trip they had to present scenes of total destruction, Dosseba said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a disaster.
Although the relief groups made the deplorable gesture of starting relief work, some complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from traveling to Palau.
According to Indonesian regulations, fund-raising, provision and staffing abroad can only begin to fluctuate if the place where a disaster occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
As the second night fell on Paul after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing people kept the hope of the miracle and their loved ones eluded the devastating story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a shackle.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the run for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliding paraglidings for the Asian Games, which concluded early this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
"As a senior in paraffin, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the para-pentist community, he had desperately sent messages from WhatsApp to Paul's competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a double blue mark.
"I think that means that the messages were not received," he added.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy told the press that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the automatic cashier in the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the report, the witnesses saw a number of suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper renames to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is renamed Ye.
Saturday, as he announced the change to Twitter, he wrote: "To be formally known as Kanye West."
A long time ago, in the 41-year-old West, he had been mutilated with the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, which is expected to present its new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the program's author.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist’s name, West had previously commented that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West at the beginning of this year, speaking about the title of his album with the radio player Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us.
I've been through Kanye, which means the only one, just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is rather a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known with various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, was worth his nickname with or without script and in capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when the country lacks enough to complete the 50th anniversary of a cruel retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "the military force would never be used again to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when student movements on the left were rooted across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador, who has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
he said the arrest and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funds allocated to the IA
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it spends on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, a specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the North American Government have announced measures in the field of IA, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world's number one for innovation in IA in 2030.
"Duplicateing the IA research budget would be a good start, as the rest of the countries are far behind the United States and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the IA field," Lee pointed out.
"Duplicate funding could duplicate opportunities for the US to support the next major discovery in IA," Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent IA companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an IA system that beat Othello's American player with the best ranking and then performed as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee positively assessed previous technological competitions by the North American Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"Sometimes, North American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "China is not the one who takes academic leaders; it is the companies".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of IA.
Lee commented that the U.S. mission in the field of IA could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should automatically offer permanent residence cards to doctors in IA," he added.
In July 2017, the China State Council presented its latest generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other US public agencies give money to North American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," Lee pointed out.
Early in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial industry and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a select Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA has announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the Natural Sciences Foundation, more than 100 million US dollars a year are currently being allocated to research in IA.
Meanwhile, months ago no measures were applied in relation to the US legislation that was supposed to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed decades ago with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim from its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Macedonian slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is doubtful if he will reach the minimum required participation of 50% for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum's paper is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the agreement with Greece being accepted?"
The name-changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that was created by the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have shown that they will have the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of the registered people voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia's referendum on the country's change of name, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scenario and putting chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join it with our heads high, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO integration will be accompanied by more than you need investment in Macedonia, which has a vacancy rate of more than 20%.
"I think the great majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev declared that a "yes" would imply the "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, led by the Macedonian Telma TV chain, 57% of the respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be of 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would have been the first hard time for the policy of the Western government since it took over last May.
Look at the video: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, scored a goal after racing the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in the Manchester City win for 2 to 0 in the match at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal at 65 minutes in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He left quickly between three Brighton's defenses, scratching with what he stepped out of the playing field.
Later, Aguero was surrounded by four green socks.
He competed for a defense before getting a few more on the coast of Brighton's area.
Then he made a pass to his left that he found Sterling.
The English front returned the pilot to the first touch, inside the area, to Aguero, who with his right leg beat the porter of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a jute that stuck to the inside of the network on the right side.
"Agüero has trouble on his foot," Pep Guardiola, city coach, told reporters.
"We have decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky I scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight for the First League.
His goal was 29 minutes away.
In that game, Aguero received the pilot deep into Brighton's field and
He made a beautiful pass in space on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the pilot before passing it to Sterling on to the long pole.
The front of the Sky Blues ended the pilot inside the network before he left the background line.
The city faces Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the group phase of the Champions League, at 6:55 p.m., at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, no options, wants to remove Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the fight for the play-off, there were no many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, expects to go out to the launcher mountain on Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who keep an advantage party on Los Angeles Dodgers at the National Western League, have the possibility to play off.
Rockies secured a comedy with the victory for 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to get their first division title.
"Although we're not playing anything, we can at least get out of here knowing the environment here, in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably argue each point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open launcher for Sunday, but apparently they're determined to let Scherzer slow down if this is happening.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, made a heat session Thursday and would launch on Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right launcher has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike removals at 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump has a meeting in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while referring to the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
That's one of the big, big... I don't introduce myself, but I actually do.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, is happening right now.
They're determined to recover power through all the necessary means, see their mechanism, their evil intent.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control.
The democratic mission, he said, is to "resist and obstruct".
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he retorted, and called the democrats "disgusted, mesquines, dirty and false".
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the high-ranking Democratic Senator of the Senate Judicial Committee, as he caused a strong public protest.
"Remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... that was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Laborist Party has stopped being a different party.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of British MPs who have been told that we're not welcome, everything to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he was determined against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censorship, I was criticized for discriminating with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, are ironically similar issues with regard to which Jeremy was discriminating with previous leaders.
In the warning of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Laborist Party, it was announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local labor MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly the same.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and for a long time the promise of "most generous and kind" policies has been forgotten if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the Party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues who previously thought he shared a political vision seemed to expect me to turn 180 and take positions that he would never have adopted, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made because my candidacy is not renewed, central policies are denounced and I'm told it shouldn't be in the Labor Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
Actually, I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they don't quit.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labor Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer that different party, and with every move of "untrusted" or every change in the rules of selection, the party got more drawn.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice and have been advised to keep my head down, that it wasn't so expressive, and that "everything would be fine."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Laborist Party 32 years ago, in my age of student, stimulated by thatcher's negligent government, who left my whole class literally buried, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted Friday's motion, I would say that at a time when the country is walking to a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to transmit was not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are laborers or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of not renewing my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Our Father Imbatuts Head of Leader
Two last-hour trials have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Airs have won this vibrant Tennant's Premiership Day game.
The Airs, which are the only team in the ten, occupy the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed because of its defensive superiority and the fact that he knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The parties we have played so far have tested us and we are still beaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Congratulations for the Airs, they have taken advantage of the best opportunities that we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, put ahead of the Airs, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, surrendered by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the digital superiority and Jason Baggot noted an unconverted test.
Climo expanded Air's advantage with a penalty and, just in the middle, noted and converted a test to put the mark 17-5 in favor of Air's rest.
But Melrose well started the second part and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then the party was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury suffered by Ruarid Knott, who withdrew to bed, and the Air arrested again extended the distance with an attempt by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Then, the Deputy Captain Blair Macpherson was pointed out with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of a more man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a landing on Climo without a pilot, from the penalty alignment, MacPherson noted a counter-test behind the Air's leaking mud.
Climo marked, as he had done almost again since the arrest, after Kyle Rowe picked up a present from David Armstrong and passed the pilot on the third line to Gregor Henry to note the fifth test of the local team.
The Still Game series star appears to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to go to the hotel sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor interprets Jack Jarvis' character in the popular BBC series, who writes and co-protagonizes Greg Hemphil, his comic partner for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "Florent Restoration Sector".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without coast, expects the court to reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors patrol through their ship's escape deck in La Paz.
Public buildings smell a blue sea flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are empathized with the motto: "The sea is our right.
To recover it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia's coastless territory, the memory of a lost coast in Chile in a violent resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the desire to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia expects the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, not necessarily, waits with a positive attitude for the result," pointed out Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ's resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will speak in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign sea exit for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for the next year's reelection, also has many hopes in the resolution on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible discussions.
TIJ's resolution, which takes place only six months after the final allegations have been submitted, indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law specialist.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a relapse in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has seized the issue of access to the sea," Zárate pointed out.
"The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has threatened any gesture of goodwill by Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
Next Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disparity, with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless I can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not remove nuclear weapons if he can't trust Washington.
Nothing spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume the stuck nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a joke to think that the US's continued sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War can make North Korea never bow down.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament movements.
Both Kim and North American President Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is seriously concerned with giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means of ensuring its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris' fashion shows reveal the latest range of large-scale hats, from the road to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of extravagance covers of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which removed the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been torn by very little practical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the passageway.
Valentino's prominent piece was an exaggerated bee hat, decorated with a wide wing, in the form of lead, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jewelry, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extravagant masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, live colors, had boiled lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than not high.
One creation resembled a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another seemed to be a frozen cone.
And if you follow the great trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that huge roofs could be implanted in the main streets near you.
Large-sized hats climb the tops of the Bomb, a ball hat, with a two-foot wing, that everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so little practical that it spread through the social networks brought another great creation to the passageway: a ball bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed with a bather that carried it.
The bag of raffia, dark orange, decorated with raffia straps and finished with a white leather nance, was the highlight piece of the collection The SS19 Riviera of Jacques in the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large accessories.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a path of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is enhanced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are striving to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will come to his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a higher A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as election assignments, are kept in the same consideration as STEM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey carried out by the UK's Employment and Competence Commission revealed that 17% of the reasons why entrepreneurs gave them the cost of covering vacancies were attributed to the lack of linguistic skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Since more and more potential job opportunities are needed in languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like that.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouTube among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not know a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
Scotland has a diversity of schools in terms of the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, he'll always be able to choose from a series of languages in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global trading environment of today, languages cannot be denied having a vital role to play in the country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will begin with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The hope has practically ended for the fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first time match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes you're going to play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said to the Lakers' official place.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After early this week's training, James was asked about his plans for the timing of six Lakers' premature parties.
"I don't need pre-temporary parties at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Meeting of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign acts tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five scheduled meetings next week, which include visits to sympathetic places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for his candidate to cover the high court's vacancy is pending, Trump intends to obtain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are issued in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
The meeting of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The meeting of Trump in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video broadcast by YouTube.
Trump is likely to hold the hearing launched this week with the candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense over the allegations of sexual abuse he was facing, while the Senate's anticipated vote of confirmation is pending for up to a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans present themselves in the delicate November elections to collect momentum.
Therefore, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand majority members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading for a busy campaign season," pointed out a spokesman for Trump who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's meeting, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together supporters "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract coverage of the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting some unfavourable results in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him impetus in the investigations," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the North American team shows its ambition to keep the face on the individual Sunday parties alive
After three unparalleled sessions, Saturday throughsoms in the afternoon were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The basculing pendulum of dynamics is an inventive sport concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on which side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're in a little positive box," Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with 12 more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and they have a lot of reason to be animated, largely by the state- shaped Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been fatal from tea to green and is giving examples.
The guitar screams of celebration rose sharply as he continued his turn and became a crucial butt to smash the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the whore that made them win the match in hole 15 with a similar cry, which indicates that he believes the American team is not out of competition yet.
"You have to work hard and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed out.
It's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to print.
The only players with more points than Spyeth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable feeling of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple carry four out of four and don't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't make a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes in the morning.
As a result, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from public bubbles, it is reaffirmed that they are the players fighting on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is setting on Le Golf National.
Mostly both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who married Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sunk Spanish and Swedish into a hole of which they never had a choice.
Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The furballs and fursoms are very fascinating to see for the interactions between the devices, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this fursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have been questioned.
Europe arrives at the end of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 favourable marker
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo format by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and to leave their record, so far, at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a little American team in the morning's fourballs and put the series in 3-1.
The US presented more resistance to the fursoms and won two parties, but could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points at the 12 individual Sunday parties to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four parties in Ryder Cup's history.
After slamming Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they staged a brilliant performance to beat a Woods deflation and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic genius spores, but lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the fourballs in the morning, remarried with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's first and third world rankings, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything on its face on a pleasant and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Speith, three times the tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a reference point for the Americans on Saturday, reaching two points.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team had raised a four-point difference to the individual parties, although the Furyk team, the title defender, just needs to stick it together to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack Sunday is coming out of range.
North Korea states that it will not be disarmed unilaterally "in any way" if trust signs are not appreciated
North Korean Foreign Minister announced Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions were intensifying their mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "good-will measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't notice any response in the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way."
While Ri reiterated the well-known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-step denuclearisation approach that North Korea would be rewarded for as it took steps gradually, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization of full, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US president and a North Korea leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang must eliminate its nuclear weapons before.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the severe international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that denuclearisation must first be done and that the level of pressure with sanctions should be increased to meet its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "war's end declaration," Ri pointed out.
"The perception that sanctions will make us kneel down is a joke to people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Nothing referred to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party involved in the denuclearization issue was South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he kept last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that pointing to the U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titled "Rocket Man" in a suicide mission.
Today in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, Kim praised for her courage to take disarmament measures, but demonstrated that much remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearised.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and final denuclearisation."
The Security Council has been promoting sanctions in North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bid to cut off the funding of Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying they had made progress, but in the end of a few hours North Korea accused him of making "own demands of a gangster".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took "consensual measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "consensual measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions to normalize Washington's relations.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
Now, a new course at Harvard University has allowed her students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat culture, increasingly widespread, to study all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic observed that students from the world’s number one university are often unaware of the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after talking about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the conversation, a girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me all this in my last year?'
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sound, which surprised me, ” reported The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told the basic concepts of how good sound habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the University decided to introduce the course after becoming aware that some students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, from an hour to an hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there's a picture of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, bamboo and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects sports performance in the lack of sleep, and about the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily journey.
"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on his health," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and the growing pressure that students suffer make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for a long time should be a "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, added, even to avoid gaining weight, since the loss of sound puts the brain in inanimate mode and makes the students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes in the last year of his first year in Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to carry out a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that alarm should be set when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic displays and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sound problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal is to condemn Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat at the Livingston house that assumes another ambush outside.
Ibrox's set was trying to add his first victory to home from the triumph of last February 4 to 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team instigated the second defeat in Gerard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team on the draw, at 8 points in the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Manga scored the goal seven minutes before half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, without inspiration, were about to equalize the marker.
While the Rangers are now falling in sixth place, Livingston is in third position, behind the hibernian because of the difference of goals.
And Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that apparently dropped from the graduation.
Gerrard made eight changes in respect of the alignment that trashed the Airs at the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven headliner who fired a point against the Hearts last week. He must have been satisfied with the way his team, well-organized, suffocated his rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the pilot.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the party, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sat down and took the great opportunity.
A massive missed launch by Keaghan Jacobs met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow made only a jolt turned into a backdrop.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty on the 15-minute signal, as he and Steven Lawless met, but Albert Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two judges to the front door, but the first porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and the front doc Ovie Ejaria.
While the first live action in 34 minutes might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserve it only because of their effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn't play with Jacobs' work.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the pilot to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet to choose Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard acted on the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, the change had a practically immediate impact, since the extreme made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the lockdown.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the attention of the visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one behind the other.
Holt's band could have given up the final stages, but McGregor was still firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a joke turned away from the corn.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again made his eyes big.
Almac: inventor of Geiger Count
And now a page of Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day that the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally gave way to the device we know as "the Geiger counter".
Count Geiger, who has been a pillar of science since then, has also become a pile of pop culture, such as the 1950's "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a seemingly failed vampire physicist:
Man: "What's that inside?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emanate from the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure it's shining now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" wicked cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and remove malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can see a common protein in many cancers and then reinject it.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, has seen the disappearance of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.: "The results we've obtained suggest we have a promising vaccine."
HER2 protein "favors the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal, has been explained by Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach consists of extracting patients' immune cells and teaching them how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was engaged in a pro-Trump diatribe with a maga hat after her performance at the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was enrolled in the study during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump, and said it would be presented in the 2020 elections.
After his third song of the night, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from Make America Great Again, he began criticizing the Democrats and repeating his support in Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say to me, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program started with a parody of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee for complaints of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's dissatisfaction record to social media.
It wasn't clear if Rock was going to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West complained to the public that it was not treated well among the builders because of the hat he was wearing.
"I was threatened by builders.
They told me I didn't get out with that hat.
I was ambushed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said that he would put on the Superman layer so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked public headlines at least twice, and the members of the program team seemed ashamed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who explained in the publication: "The whole study remained completely silent."
West acted as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left a lot of the audience perplexed by the interpretation of the song I Love It, dressed in Perrier's bottle.
West won the support of the conservative group leader TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: GRAYS TO DETACATE THE MULTITY."
But the debate programme presentation, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "being who it is and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or by supporting their art) who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed and that it was now "the first known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed his name to a symbol and later the artist known earlier as Prince.
Trial murder charge for stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after the murder of a man in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the court of first instance of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
The Star of the Throne Game, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of the Squad Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of male hero, claiming that these papers imply that young boys often think they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of the Throne Game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted to having a strong determination to deal with this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've made mistakes about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television can be part of the responsibility of increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so virile characters.
He added, "What's innate and what's acquired?
What do you learn from television and the streets that make young people feel that they have to have this facet of manhood?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because there's no doubt something wrong with the young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any precellar or sequel of the Throne Game when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he's full of battles and horses.
As of November, Kit will be taking the lead in the true West work of Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best that has provided him with a Throne Game.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character that Kit, Jon Snow, represented in an Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only 40,000 new cases were declared in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV for this cause has declined almost to zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of the LGBT collective is common.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who maintain homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from the Republican Party senators and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters reported on Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three US republican senators on the pages of Wikipedia of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that requests were driven by extreme right-hand criticism and websites.
"Disgusting lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Apparently, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by someone unknown to the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on sexual abuse complaints against the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and revealed information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
"This baseless complaint is completely false and a pure lie," continued the Waters.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this data filtering.
This baseless complaint is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," wrote Fleischer.
"That makes me think he doesn't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the defendant's motives.
You have to keep calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who submitted to overthrow Waters in mid-legislative elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will make sure that the offenders are revealed, he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions that have taken place and that they have damaged all of my staff."
Criticism by Johnny English Strikes Again: limited spore parody by Rowan Atkinson
It's already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this reposition of the frankity of Johnny English's action-comedy parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction about how we are despicable will be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetent looking and face rubber Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to ruin everything. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comic created designed for non-English speaking territories with tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquid glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point by Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the fire Carros theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious Atkinson traveler who was now representing the forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard, where he looked like chaos all over the place.
There's one or two good times on this last J.E. trip.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and helical sheets were wrapped up in the helmet.
You see the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems pretty fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission IP now include comedy as an ingredient.
humour seems to be aimed at children more than not adults, and, for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as Mr. Bean's dumb jokes representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hack has been infiltrated into the British supersecret web spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, which causes the service agent's confusion, a regrettablely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resource for a prime minister who is a pretentious and obsessed figure, who is already suffering a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her the best of her with this figure under Teresa-May, but the script does not go any further.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as each active spy is in danger, it will have to recover some retirement.
And this includes the poor Johnny English, now employed as a professor in some luxury institution, but teaching extra-official classes about how to become a hidden agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a espionage academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his successor, Bough, who re-presents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of when things are very loose in His Majesty's secret service they come back into action and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the charm of the technological billionaire charismatic that he claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sad Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their hate of ridiculous madness: dressed in quarters, set on fire a French fast food restaurant, seem to smuggle chaos on board the luxury yacht of Volta, and English causes great confusion in trying to use a helmet of virtual reality to get familiar with the interior of the Volta house.
All the stops have certainly been drawn from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and the noise it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
Pretty normal things.
Like the other Johnny English movies, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role to play in his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it's planning a plan for British people to have a four-day working week and cover five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Laborist Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to spend the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers giving them a more party day.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they got the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit the economic agenda of the parties and the plans to propel the country in favour of the workers.
Change in a four-day work week is supported by trade union confederation Trade Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Laborist Party stated in The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the party's perspective of balancing the economy for the worker and the party's general industrial strategy."
The Laborist Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this ambition jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "A four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The minister in the shadow John McDonnell used the party conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The minister's plans in the shade also imply that water company shareholders might not recover the entire investment, as the laborer could apply "deductions" for the crimes he perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees together with companies and to create property funds including to deliver 10% of private sector firm shares to employees, who expect annual dividends worth up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their mind.
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes" correspondent asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that made them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than her South Carolina colleague.
"Speak it seriously," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done so.
He was firm, determined, and sure."
But Graham's vote seems burnt.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would bring an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it round," added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people he appoints will be able to verify.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event, which presents an absolutely impressive star program, which will carry out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition, the Global Citizens Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as that of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global objective of the event to end extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international defenses that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to combat it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (although someone wants to pay a VIP entry), assistants had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a telephone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizens achieved now that they are 12 years old to reach their goal?
The idea of winning people with a free concert is a good way to convince them to demand a call for action or just a case more than what we call "clickivism" (people who think they make the difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have helped to achieve various objectives.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37,000 million, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which $10,000 million has already been disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that from now on, protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, an association of investors and realists with them in the United Kingdom, which undertakes to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, such as you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a page of history," said Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions that requested the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the P+F's websites that asked you, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard path. Sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights defence movements and the previous apartheid, we will triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at the event in New York, presenting Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports (secretary of the Interior)
Washington may, if necessary, resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted as saying.
Zinke has complained that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he allegedly said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke was addressed to assistants at the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is self-defined as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are really the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, while pointing out that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost exports of its natural gas liquefied to Europe, in substitution for Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the Nord Stream 2 "inadequate" pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11,000 million and will double the gas pipeline capacity of 11 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak declared after a meeting with the US Energy Department Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the US has provoked a negative response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German industry, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to separate EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he will "think carefully" his candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "think carefully" his candidacy for the presidency after the mid-legislative elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and settle the government's fracture, for women to take on high office," The Hill said.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy to the president seriously."
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction".
"I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday's Twitter, Warren said, "Of course the FBI needs an investigation before the elections."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed it should not be presented by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters have said the senator should not be presented, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The investigation revealed a broader support for the candidacy of Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other high profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible 2020 candidate include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quoted TEPT Track Palin as being affected at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after listing September 11, 2007
Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"With what's happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT branching and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers are returning with," explained to the public at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans: "they turn a little different, they turn into tough, they come back wondering if there is respect for what his soldiers and pilots, as well as any other army member, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, brought by the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district presented a curiae friend in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the request for the Grace vs Sessions case that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his spouse "and the children of the violent gang" attacked her, but the US officers denied his asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are born in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded according to the facts and particular circumstances of the request, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the curiae friend.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies entry of immigrants damages the US economy, as it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in their June 11th announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the worst, people face every day around the world.
Efforts to save the dead in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma while calming her son with fever in an evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined houses to take floodwaters and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and hospitals, abused by magnitude 7.5, are saturated.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Harris, that broke the shoulder, are outside of the Palu military hospital, as patients are treated outside because of the strong repeated saggings.
Her tears denied her eyes as she explained how the violent earthquake shook the room of the fifth floor of the hotel where she was meeting her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," said Harris to Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the town.
"I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "advertising ads."
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in a North American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the most recent newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of joining the U.S. Congress on 6 November, a charge that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US elections marked what North American officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an intensified trade war that has seen oranges in mutual imports.
China's vengeful oranges at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who now supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and North American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and Governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "He is redoubled by publishing advertisements to our free press."
"By disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the estimated North American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by inserting a payment ad in The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find few disconcerting voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens may have on China's worrying economic path, since the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was missing the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before mid-legislatorial elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
Since many of the main Republicans support and defend the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which faces various requests for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the forthcoming mid-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans have officially shown that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone," explains Grant Reeher, a professor of political sciences at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last hour's pressure to carry out an FBI investigation is enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington's D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants called "November is coming!" (November approaching) as they appeared in the Senate lobby while Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will remain out of the chart," explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've been tall; it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among the voters of suburban women and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote until they like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness, where he detailed his sexual assault applications to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could be made if the Republicans pressured confirmation.
"This has become an embolism for the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote of the board or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh sits in the accused's bank. It also has to do with how Republicans have managed this issue and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps choose Democrats, in the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the star of Ford and the witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the balance that is slightly deduced to the last.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of the surveys believe in an indisputable or probable way in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe in an indiscriminate or probable way.
In addition, 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or unmistakable during his testimony, while about 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating requests filed by Ford and, at least, another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez complains that the candidate to the Supreme Court taught the genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source Platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," said the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal data store" or an POD.
May contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser at the same time.
What's exclusive from the personal data store is that the user is who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work on the project and a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday's publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new web age," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the I GM Victory Cross
The only minister of the Church of England who won a Cross Victory during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann got the guard on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was beaten by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons stripped off a memorial stone on a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's preserved prose.
According to The London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and subways."
Later he ran to the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage", made the line move forward before he threw himself on a canon with one hand and left atones three members of the stand.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a proselytism that could never equal, which produces a feeling of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
The MMA fans who stayed out all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you're awake all night to see Bellator 206 and you're denied seeing the most important event.
The San José cartel contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and had to be seen live all night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, UK spectators were attuned when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted with having been up late into the morning to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change in cartoons as "a kind of vomiting acuity".
"The government's legislation says that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Marketing and Communication Bellator, when asked about the retransmission.
"Pick the goose, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include UK spectators in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won't be able to solve it until Sunday at our hour on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were lots of messages coming and coming, and not everyone was nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, and we tried to show it again to the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of their sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the program Desert Island Radio Discs 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father was important to him in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months to get sick.
Daley, who appeared as a naufrag in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" others because "it was not socially acceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, not to disappoint anyone when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image of the Commonwealth games of ejaculation in Australia to ask more countries to describe homosexuality.
He said that he had spoken because he was happy to be able to live openly without branching and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's trim champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American performer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "suddenly caught me."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 bigger than he did, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you pass out when you are young (participating in his first Olympic games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar high and low levels.
The couple were parents in the June of a child they named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die, and one of the last things he requested was whether he had already received his entry for London in 2012, because he wanted to be first in line.
"I couldn't tell her "father, you won't be there to take the first row," she said.
"As he held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that it was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in Olympics. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and that he was still wearing chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
An evil Mickelson introduced himself to the Ryder Cup Saturday
The North American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical status if he doesn't want to become a lucky tape.
Mickelson, who will participate in the two-year event to record for 12 times, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as usual for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments shares his time between making an animation and working on his game in the field, hoping to correct what hurt him.
He's never made the most direct drivers, not even at the very moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's difficult journey, where the long rough habit is to punish the lost blows.
And if your own trajectory is not disappointing enough, Mickelson, in the new game on Sunday, will face the exact British Open, Francesco Molinari, champion who joined Tommy Fleetwood Rockie to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual parties, start strong, Mickelson's party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a thumb on my back and hugged me with his arm while he told me he was ready the next day," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
It's a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams earlier and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we should move forward.
He wants to be there, like any other."
Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that didn't equal its individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 victories and 7 matches, although Furyk has said his presence has brought untold numbers to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke about people and he's a big teammate," he explained.
"I think the younger players also had fun staying with him this week, which was fun to see.
It's a lot more than your game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of Ryder Cup's last day can easily become a hard day.
Danish started in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but eventually they won the victory for the least, 14.5-13.5.
"And you continue to remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but slowly," said Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the 2018 team win for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, leaving the marker in 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught us to me and all the crew members that are not finished yet.
He has to go to the whole machine tomorrow.
He's got to get out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we need to keep the concentration to do so.
I've already said, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Delighted with the performance of their players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added, "I will never rush with this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's individual performance will mark the difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to deliver to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furik, expects his players to render better individually than on the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows all two faces of the coin about the last day's rally, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up losing in the "Miracle de Medina" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how he motivated Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start with good foot, as was seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure on these central duels.
We've prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try and do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the rally against Rory McIlroy at the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," says Bjorn about his selection for individual confrontations.
The new warship of Germany, seconded again
The German Army's new fragate should have ended in 2014 to replace the former warships of the Cold War, but it will not, at least, do so until the year it comes out of faulty systems and an increase in costs, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class fractures, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships that the Army commissioned in 2007 will replace the former Bremen class fractures.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air and anti-bulk missiles, as well as technology against furtive actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods of maintenance: it should be possible to use the new fractures up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the outboard ships, which were expected to be able to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will be obsolete when they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 was already reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
There are few details of the reasons why he came back, but the German media have quoted various "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it inservable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as about 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the former Bremen class fractures, operate on Baden-Württemberg class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the ship's weight is excessive, that it reduces its performance and limits the Army's ability to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate will weigh twice as many class ships as the Germans used during World War II.
In addition to defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is believed that it has reached some surprising EUR 3,100 million ($3,600 million) from an initial budget of EUR 2,200 million.
The problems of the new fractures have become a matter of special importance, given the recent warnings that Germany's military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, has recognized that the Army "is being left without ships that can be used".
The officer has said that the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using the old ships, but it was not provided again as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the baden-Württemberg-class fractures could join the Army.
The National Foundation spys on the secret life of the fugitives
A new research carried out in an area of the Highlands of Scotland aims to find out how to use the landscape for food.
It is hoped that discoveries can provide new data on the behaviour of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be soprano and common, as well as northern and water-swimming bats in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key property locations to monitor the activities of the tenants during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed picture on the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes that the results show which habitat areas are most important for reptiles and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for reptiles and other associated species.
The population of rabies in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building and restoration tasks threaten the homeless, as they affect the nests and can cause loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting are also at risk, like the murder paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the hypocrites are not blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a catch.
Use a sophisticated echo location technique to locate insects and obstacles that occur on your flight.
The National Scotland Foundation, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the victims very seriously.
He has ten experts with appropriate training, who carry out surveys, zero inspections and, at times, usually rescued.
Even so, the organisation has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to raccoons at the Thrave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland's ten species of raccoon.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a large area for the rappers," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habit.
But we still don't know many aspects of patience, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to grow."
It notes the importance of checking if there are any delays before performing maintenance tasks in property, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single motherhood infant kills more than 400 women and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of a whole local population.
Punctuals are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, harass them and destroy their children.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Foundation for the Conservation of Reaps, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about the people and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data about their population."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while his lawyers prepare a complaint against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has said that people "want to become famous" by their name.
His lawyers will ask for the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The front of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of violating a U.S. woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He probably paid $375.000 at the time because the incident was not public, according to the information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video from Instagram Live, he addressed his 142 million followers hours after the charges were publicized, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the gold pilot in the camera five times.
"They want to make themselves famous on my behalf.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the claim against Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have described as "unacceptable information about private life", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz has said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a hotel suite and casino Palms de Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly violated her anonymously, according to reports filed by the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except a "1%".
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual relations, but they agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later she accepted an agreement outside the courts because she was "fear of reprisals" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the deal, as she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to land for King Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he landed for the Jew, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "would regret forever" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret it forever" if you lost the world's leading state in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "anxious" that the Toyota base in the United Kingdom had claimed to the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without reaching an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaton factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the case of an unagreed Brexit could cause job losses.
Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point of view is that if the UK leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
To leave the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has aroused fears from other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to which manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of non-agreement of Brexit.
The Toyota production line is carried out on a "just in time" basis, with pieces every 37 minutes of UK suppliers and the European Union for the manufacture of cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could generate delays and scarcity of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a consequence.
Clark says the Theresa May Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We need to reach an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the present success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The tests not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota couldn't confirm how long production would be stopped, but in the long run, she warned that added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the United Union on the ground, said that members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said, "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "suspended one week" while continuing the struggle on the appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia and assistance in Trump and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump is fired or not by the Deputy Attorney General and putting Mueller's independence at risk, he's been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of depositing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said "I'd rather not" congratulate Rosenstein, but he postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee to which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "It has not yet been fixed, it might be this week, although it may be that it will be a week longer for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might reject this statement: Sanders has not held an information session of the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the fanfare of television journalists, although he said, "I won't deny that they're fanfare."
He then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press should be increased.
"The president has more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any source: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders has said that the information sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the information sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press circles with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press wheels are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at times, he's weird in front of the journalists gathered.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service due to Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express their gratitude to the country and wishes to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter within six months of the entry of the United Kingdom of the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of state-of-state requests for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be headed towards the decisions expected this afternoon.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible unagreed scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and above all, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service task, while benefiting the patients and communities we deal with.
Of course Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering injury to the head
Christian Abercrombie, a reindeer of Tennessee State Tigers, has undergone an emergency operation after suffering an injury on Saturday at the Battle for 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, Tennesseen.
Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the middle.
"He came to the sideline and broke up there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before putting it on a bed and taking it to do more tests.
A Tennessee State officer reported to Chris Harris, WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left a chirophan at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's Abercrombie's first season, second year, with Tennessee State after landing from Illinois.
He had completed five pitches on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes him a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Hisenda hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp tax on buying property in the United Kingdom and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure Theresa May announces today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises of providing more affordable dwellings that would affect higher returns.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be spent on government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
Overcharge, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping the prices of the properties by quickly buying land and not using it, and urged May to cancel the taxes on affordable homes to correct the British real estate disaster.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on the rental and finalization of "no blame".
He also wants to give the councils more authority to build new homes.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it is not right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies with them abroad, to buy housing compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home owned is too far away and the indignity of homeless people makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
Scotland, 42 years old, has accepted the challenge of revising the club in the northeast, which currently holds the third position in League One, at three points of the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last summer.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a support, and that's all," Ross said to the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"But I grew up seeing a lot of playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was young and it's always something that makes me fall back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's training post include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's ex-con says he's not under the pressure to be next on a list of names dedicated to such a big team, after he's previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can get this team back to the First League.
With the structure and installation of the club, it is clear that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just think I'd made it here if I could get the club back."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the technical body of Hearts.
He helped Alloa to avoid falling into the third category and transformed St Mirren to fight for salvation to champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the assignment to the Alloa.
"I've always thought training was what was given me better than playing.
It sounds weird because I did it right, I got out of it reasonably and enjoyed quite a good time.
But playing can be very hard.
There are a lot of things you have to do every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the more comfortable I've felt since I was an adult."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has fired consumption at the bars with Britain's difficulties, but it has added more pressure to the restaurants' chains.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's financial advisor, the company that collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sun and England's participation in the world, which has expanded beyond expectations, have led July to follow a pattern similar to that of June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The fall of 1.8% in consumption in June restaurants has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have achieved the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has gone down.
Bars offering food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, the sales of drinks have increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the Asia and hotel analysts RSM, said, "These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to sales of the external ocean market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% per annum would be particularly damaging, more than constant cost pressure.
This summer was so long and hot it could not have come at a worse time for the trades that serve food and time will say whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide this needed breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including recent openings, has been 2.7% in July, as it indicates the encouragement in the presentation of brands.
The The Copper Peach Tracker sales indicator for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of more than 9 million pounds and is the sector's established benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One out of five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students indicated an increase in "Insta fake" pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students claim they have a "main" account that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students has indicated a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about posting sexual content.
A 20% of students claim they have a clean "main" account that they show their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager who urged others to "violate me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors Committee (HMC), revealed that 40% of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many adolescents are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Eilid Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Federation of Athletics Directive at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with more Scottish medals, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide sports to benefit from his international experience in the last decade.
"Eilid has respect for the community of Scottish athleticism, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am very eager to act as an athlete's voice and I hope I can make sport grow and contribute to Scotland."
The U.S., who won the gold in the 2000s and 400s at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympics and currently a usual BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after an Ischemic Transitional Attack.
He wrote the following on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell me if I could recover or to what extent.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered from everything, I've learned to walk again, and today it's about to exercise agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
An ad that compares the seas to cows divides opinion over the Internet
A shooting company has divided its opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares lactating mothers to cows that grow up.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent shooting that can be carried out in the world", the technology company for consumer Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a music video of jokes to show the freedom that gives the new shooting to the seas.
Four real seas dance in a grain full of flour and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters such as: "Yes, I love myself, but you won't see a tail" and "For if you hadn't noticed, they're not lame, but my breasts."
The return continues: "Bomb, pump, baby food, pump, pump, pump."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions that it has seen, many of which claim to show the "horror" of the lactic industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after birth," wrote one person.
Elvie is secretly hidden in a lactating holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Understandingly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to announce a birth certificate to mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an off-site ad."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song to be fun.
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to give a baby.
Bomber for the shooter made me feel exactly as if it were a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun ad for mothers who pump guns (usually at their place of work or at the bathroom and feel like cows.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the lactic industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the rifle quietly placed on the supporters.
The concept that hides behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women feel like cows when using the rifle.
However, the Elvie shooter is completely silent, he has no cable or tube and quietly fits into a lactating holder, making women more free to move, subjecting the babies, and even getting out while he's pumping.
Ana Balarin, a mother's first-child society and developer, said, "Elvie's tyrant is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative campaign.
By drawing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the audience how a tyrant is used and the challenges that it is supposed to do, while demonstrating, entertainingly and didactically, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new tyrant.
It's not the first time Elvie's been on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the screen for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children, quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children in detention has increased even though monthly incomes across the border have practically remained stable, in part because the rhetorical duration and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to become embittered.
Traditionally, most of the patterns were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid to risk their chances of staying in the country if they decided to take a child.
Risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adults living in their homes will have to send digital fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Duane Control Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
"It's up to 80% of the people who have taken or lived in the home of a person who has taken, are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to submit to the court within one month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear for videoconference, instead of presence, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent seizures or escape attempts, according to the workers and reports they've made known the system in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of its size, signs of a child suffering are ignored.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to their friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Munamel asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," said the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced persons.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have cleansed the entire Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground of a country hit by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for evading "irrational" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the last major rebel base, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with Russia's help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and has expressed the hope that military action will confront the jihadists, including combatants of the Al-Nusra Front, bound to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
Mixture staff, sent from the United Nations, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and the opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and preparing the way to elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump's gonna win for a second
According to this logic, Trump would once again win the 2020 elections, which, as many liberal spectators probably expect, the scandals and the destitution process ended with their presidency in a premature manner.
What would, of course, be the end of a more dramatic presidency of history.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the number of maximum audience spectators has been more than doubled to 1.05 million in the NCC and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show, from MSNBC, has led cable TV audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"People have been thrown away because they don't understand," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the "Designed Survivor" series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", he has another theory.
Remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him I'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He answered me that because he made him laugh," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike TV programs, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families could meet together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a group of experts debate the use Bob Woodward made of "private use" sources for his book Fair", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("a piece of thick clothing like his pride," titled Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes me seem to be part of a telereality program is that every night gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the character changes and tour of Trump's program (fighting with NFL, laur Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to lose an episode because you're behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house on the northern coast of Kaui, but he was shut down looking at MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we were doing those dirty programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be some kind of joke, but they seemed to be right."

Foreign money flows the middle parliamentary elections to the most adjusted House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in effect in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realisation of the congressional districts that have made two current members compete for the same place.
This recent redeployment of Pittsburgh's suburban district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decreeed that the former districts were divided in an unconstitutional way in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organisations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a special election held in March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but withdraws it
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners took off the management team of the Trump Organisation.
Officials of the Department of State decided to withdraw heads of US diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions on the failure to recognise Taiwan," said Heather Naurut, who was the head of the department this month.
However, only the possibility of punishing El Salvador, which in 2017 received US aid of $140 million, was envisaged, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths for murder and arrest.
With the steps of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials of the administration clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, because it effectively ended with any probability of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been elected to the meeting, now scheduled for October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on it, according to diplomats.
The three US envoys returned discreetly to their offices in Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations from the anonymous.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymous, corroborated the statements.
History Study
The next event could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump to justice, of which there are numerous evidence in the public registers.
As far as it goes, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be found reporting to the organization, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even in front of a party jury.
These are many circumstances, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, nor any of its European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflation like this and accelerates or delays the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing several points of inflation.
What will happen if Trump is awarded to Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water on his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for the charge.
Rosenstein says the Times information is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court all and the credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of the legislature a Congress that will make Trump responsible?
If we don't get past these tests, democracy will start to be dangerous.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, he emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light up Saturday lights on that table with evastic.
With this luggage, how come I don't have to be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans, of the Rangers, face-to-face optimist against the Rapid in Vienna
The Rangers received the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive coup in the Vila-real field this month, would leave him in a good position to classify himself as the G group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented migcamist Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until 2-2 against the Vila-real, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Vila-real is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the party believing that we could get a valuable result and we got out with a point.
Maybe we could have removed something else in the end, but generally, the empath was probably a fair result.
They were better at first, but we were better at second.
On Thursday, it's another big European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it'll be a hard game because they brought a good result to the last match, but I'm sure we'll do everything and get a good result with the support of the affection.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's fine and the boys enjoy it, the training's good.
I hope we can do everything we can, leave behind the past season and succeed."
Women lose sound for fear of savings for retirement
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
About half of the national surveys say they've talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10% of the surveys say he talked to the children.
"People want some family to take care of them, but they don't dare to think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care for yourself if you do not communicate with your desires in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial adviser in your conversation. It can also help you to determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term insurance options can include a long-term long-term insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do that.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the step into legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person who supervises your medical care and ensures that professionals fulfill your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the possibility of hiring a notary arrest for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your family elder has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify such details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that "must be determined, but also which doctors you want to deal with," Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
Man shot several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots of a compressed air gun while he's back home after he leaves for the night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
'The officers described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 in the morning (in the "British Summer Time"), as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His life is not in danger of injuries, and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
As communications are cut, relief units have not been able to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area in northern Palu closest to the magnitude earthquake epicenter of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some important data on Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Celebes, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donghala is a regent that extends over 300 km north-west coast of the island of Celebes.
Regent, an administrative region less than one province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but mainly in Morowali, on the coast of the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Donghala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in the west of Dongala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific fire belt and it is often struck by earthquakes.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are listed below:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that devastated the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude struck a pop-up area of the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, on the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 20 feet (10 m) that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunamis occurred, but more than 100 people died because of the collapsed buildings.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's older son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29-year-old Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he stretched his phone.
Palin is detained at Mat-Su's temporary detention centre, where he is detained with an unsecured obligation of $500, according to KTUU.
He attended the court on Saturday, when he was declared "not guilty, safely" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin faces three class A flaws, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also accused of a class B deficiency, which can be punished with a day in prison and $2,000 fines.
It's not the first time that criminal charges are registered against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska vet court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
Her husband declared that he had given her a blow in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for associating her child's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake hit Indonesia Island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks don't work and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake took place right on the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media broadcast videos at the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York ask for the death penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a West Side Highway bike in Lower Manhattan and to hit roadside and cyclists during his trip in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the intent notice to request the death penalty presented to the South District of New York.
Both crimes could be capital punishment, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-shot indictment that included eight counts of murder for organised crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required "significant planning and pre-meditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and devious".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's families and friends Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the intent notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time New York's South District brought a death penalty to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being conspired to carry out spying actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he had told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be deployed in his hospital room.
He's declared innocent of the 22nd charge.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a life without freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events to all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Member of the parliament of the Conservative Party states that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the conservative party's conference.
UKIP's former leader has said politicians should "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own members suggested that they should lead negotiations with the EU.
The non-respective Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when the Union's Conservatives presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is fighting to preserve his Chequers' compromise plan between Brexit's supporters' attacks, the Union's supporters and the EU.
The allies insist that they will reach agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the Conservative Party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Solihull's Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to undo the Chequers compromise.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd already be out,' he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must undo the Chequers compromise."
To clarify its opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that said the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British population has changed their minds and wants to stay there is completely false."
Brexit's conservative party Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of reporters: "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, that you listen to people."
"The Chequers compromise is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is unpopular among our party and our activists, who are the people who go out in the street and get us to win some elections.
Leave the Chequer's engagement and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that meeting politicians must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, ready to betray Brexit, feel pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us victory over Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Union's supporters marched to Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small number of activists shook banners against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada agreement plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren intends to consider presenting himself as a candidate for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would examine the possibility of presenting herself as a presidential candidate after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports Saturday, Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presented for his re-election in November against the state representative of the GOP Geoff Diehl, who was the deputy president of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been a centre of speculation about the possibility of relaunching Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open format since Trump took over his post.
An assistant asked him if he intended to present himself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for the death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for death at the hands of LSU's basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson at the 11 a.m. IT Press Conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for cooperation to identify the man of the shooting.
Yes, 20 years old, he got a shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims received a shot at the head that finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in the media for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got a shot at Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a gun, and had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and was taken to custody in the East Baton District Police Department.
Yes, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the title of the world after the team's orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valteri Bottas stood in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position on the first two occasions and invited Vettel to attack his companion.
Vettel entered boxes before and left Hamilton running with the transit to the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop boxing and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton made progress after a certain wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to abandon the free inner part with the risk of staying out after a double movement to defend the third horn.
Max Verstappen started at the last row of the grid and at the end of the first time he was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he continued in good standing, keeping his wheels in order to save time, move to Kimi Raikkonen, and move to the fourth position.
Finally, he went into the box at round 44, but he couldn't increase his pace the next eight times, and Raikkonen was in fourth position.
It's a hard day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told he'd let me through.
The team did a fantastic job to have a U-dos," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday meeting to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of sexual abuse at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee, but rather commented that what was happening to the Senate was proving that people are "trouble, cruel and liars".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate lately, when you see anger, when you see angry, angry, cruel, and lying people," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the filtrations and they say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? "Eh, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... no, we didn't filter it." He added while he was imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Kavanaugh's statements against Ford in July and it filtered in September, but Feinstein denied that the filtering would proceed from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me to."
But his denial displeased the President, who commented at the Saturday night meeting: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using statements for their own purposes.
"They are determined to recover power through the necessary means.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to climb to have power and control," said the President, according to the Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the victory of Friday in Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately won a two-ball prize thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalized the Dundee, and then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who just won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in four minutes, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaul's assistance, four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvilier would double his advantage.
During this initial period of agitation, Sullivan repositioned the home team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the Giants' advantage in the first break when he achieved the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the match at the end of the second and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
A dead air controller to rescue hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after he died to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a great earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many replicas in the area and there are many people trapped between the runes in the city of Palu.
However, despite their companions fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that Batik 6321, which was on the track at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he left the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"That broke our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster relief agency has reported that access to the cities of Donganga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of dead is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the runes and there are still many that have not been accessed," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a length of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minions have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working against clockwork to help survivors, but we don't know what to find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesian Aviation Accident: Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after an accident in the lake
The airline operating a flight to a Pacific island in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the plane that was being sunk.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, from Saturday afternoon, they did not find a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane was stuck in the lacquer because the track was short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the track up.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the belt to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began to yell, and that he suffered a mild wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy said that the mariners who were working close to improve a spring also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport people affected to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters inside the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in air traffic accidents recorded in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composed a nighttime chronology that burned a woman alive
The prosecutor concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning lives a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness to the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to build the 29-year-old, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that it was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, as his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for a few weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that it was only a week ago that they knew each other.
Rowlett said that, some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"She deleted her from her life," said Hale.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be held by the jury on the same day.

Another black person?!
NY Children's Day Ask for a Greeting after a "racist" message
A New Yorker complained to a couple for a discriminatory suit after receiving a wrong-directed text message from the mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare demand with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two, expressed concern that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing of her pipe, a "comfort" Mrs. Plasco-Faxman congratulated Mrs. Maurice, alleging that the little girl she had praised, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and then sent her home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims compensation from the couple for the commission and asks for compensation from, about, 350 USD per day for work with a residence of six months for which she was hired, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do things like this," he told the post on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to statements that they were racist all claiming that Maurice's commission was the most reasonable, because they were afraid they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife sent him something I didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said Joel Plasco's husband at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in someone's hands with whom you've been chatting, even if it was wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand with an "extortion," said that his wife had two months to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude," the investor banker added.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the public opinion court has hurried to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bone, according to a new card
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: "It's hard to put herself in someone's place that the law for the first time before its publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book on a small hairdresser, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "adorable", after his death last year.
Describe Paddington as a very important member of his family and pretends that his father was very proud of him, of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he wasn't a suspect," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son got something: you're proud, even if it's not yours.
I think that's how he considered Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized his own merit in Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
When they landed, they took their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was very serious and that they didn't expect it to get over it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I went to call Nad and he told me he'd die in the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs they had given her to keep her body bathing were consuming and getting out of her system.
He'd died before what he was supposed to do, and that's how everything turned out.
I just had to sit there and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep the good shapes."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience she was experiencing.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had his head and his tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad.
The feeling I needed my love and my understanding.
I know I loved her very much."
Doll data hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a galley bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when she began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, she was killed.
"I don't want no father or mother to feel what I have to hear every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said their smile could illuminate any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark point."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm continuously concerned that there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people you can turn to, that they can listen to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was Mrs. Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"Never said he was not well or that he was depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched the bottom of Christmas, when the children opened their presents and he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
He said that his death meant a great trauma to them, but that they had to work on it: "Open a hole in the family.
It's ruining us.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is holding on to a thread while the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be destroyed with the dead end of the supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters republish an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks are missing for the mid-term elections of November 6, if, as expected, Republicans fail to achieve good results, they will see weaknesses in achieving that the man they want elected to go to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, since she was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to undo the coup and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean "cau" deserters with Kim
The number of deserters in North Korea in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago, according to a South Korea legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said that 1,127 deserts had occurred last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rising prices for traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Normally, most North deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, instead of refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general to work to achieve a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and is not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the House's minority Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate in the High Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that his temper is unable to work in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her that she was a " hysterical," said Pelosio in relation to her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh's before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the allegations of sexual abuse by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh became very excited, sometimes shouting and without words while talking about his family and his years at the school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats and said the charges against him were "gross murder and coordinated by a character" organised by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's witness demonstrated that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reticence when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, whether it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats reached the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he's not only able to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge at the Columbia District Appeals Tribunal.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he asked questions as to whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical person to enter the Court with prejudice and hope that it seems wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a legitimate diary: months and years of plenty of anger and can't take it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's common.
He continued... "He helped me a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started to cry, telling the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a majority male, where once I ended up crying with an indescribable anger, it's one of the biggest women (a cold directive that had always terrorized me a little) who took me out of the closet and dragged me to the eye of the scale.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy, because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarriage adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," she said to me as she laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said, "Blank and the Seven Nanes."
Because he was late for the campaign, he was late for fundraising, so he promised he wouldn't enter the race if he didn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When he made his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thank you for the people who helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money, and for guiding voters, instead of doing so to delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he lost his voice.
"I might have thought I had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the press's reaction.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my tomb?
"Will you cry?"
How the US - China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The initial rescues of the US-China trade war were overwhelming, and although it doesn't seem that the war should be over soon, a distance of countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, issued his first warning early this year when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale was this week, with new oranges affecting products worth USD 200,000 million.
Beijing has counterattacked each and every time in the same way and has recently raised the oranges from five to ten percent for $60,000 million in American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the United States, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will be back soon.
Making Washington go back would mean giving up on some demands, but leaning publicly to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had foreseen," says Abigail Grace, an associate researcher centred in Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of over seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"At present, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are also six million people in the country who are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's Selection Wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's 2018 Ryder Cup was successful in defeating the North American election with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six consecutive times in Europe and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European election again won the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, shot out the water at the par 316 hole, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined on all his series and became one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 since he started the current format of the 1979 tournament.
US Jordan Spieth was separated by a 5–4 player from the European Chosen Thorbjorn Olesen in Denmark.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
He will veto him with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the greatest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, so glad I recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... and I am happy to have been able to help," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the link to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of the North American golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches he had in France and now he has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
A strange statistics for one of the best players that ever existed, with 14 big titles won and only behind Jack Nicklus.
The North American selection fought all weekend to find the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-end golf all the time.
North American captain Jim Furyk spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressed the European selection.
We fought.
I'll take my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's got to be a hat out there.
They've defeated us."
