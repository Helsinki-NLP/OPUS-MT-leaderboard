Two drivers between the two points call traffic flow to the school that goes and talks between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic speeds because the driver's performance is not necessarily one hundred times understood.
Fortunately, there is a tendency to move within the range of drivers and thus the transport system can be presented mathematically in a reasonable range.
