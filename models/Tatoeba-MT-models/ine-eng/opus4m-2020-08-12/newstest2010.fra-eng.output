Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway for 26 hours and be the fourth American president of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be given to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife, Michelle, will land in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who selected him in October among 172 persons and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth American President to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the price in the Committee's own right.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan when the price was redeployed.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he is receiving this prize by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million euros).
He intends to make a donation to charity, but he has not yet decided which.
His program will then lead him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and the queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defendant of the nature accused of blackmail
The police in Litomérice accused the president of the Association Society of Protectors of the nature of Litomérice of blackmail.
On several occasions last year, he appealed for several construction works and demanded money from investors for his personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his call, said Alena Romová, spokesperson for the Litomérice police.
The president of the Society of the Protectors of the nature of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and at risk for up to three years in prison.
Waste tricycles are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their drinking packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on tri-belts at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes to find the right goods.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort out all the waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that the city councillors, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the age of three of the wastes, not only because citizens can still choose only paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of goods devoted to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is all science, which requires, above all, time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me to, but I don't think it's sacred.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city this is not a sinecury nor any more.
In this way, many of my friends don't choose their waste.
By far away.
It's a trick for them to get to the estate.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to throw some bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any Kounicova street color beads.
Luckily, I found the right place by taking the tram.
That's what it says, the waste is getting out of it.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best city, right?!
It is likely that ecology and alleged aestheticism are of little interest to Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying some extra goods and proposing the three more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after drawing a moment on the Internet.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole Moravia region of the South.
Parobek's budget has been set aside from retirement and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or officials may lack money for retirement, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the government's going to make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just to solve the problems later, to mine the land," Janota said.
It is important to know that the interest to be paid on the money is increasing and that it will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state doesn't really have the choice where to own the money.
If it does not reduce social aid or expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
All those currently on the left have increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear their retirement or sickness insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater state end - next year it will not be lacking 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, debt will grow faster and with it, the costs of interest.
The State will need money to repay it and it will not be enough to increase the VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be five billion to complete the construction of railways and roads due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections which have already been decided and started and which it is not possible to modify the projects to reduce costs if necessary.
Keep them as much as possible, which is not free or no more.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major buildings, and the collection of European funds is also at risk, according to Karel Hanzelka, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to settle the financial deficit very appropriately - it will be able in the dividends of the ČEZ (electric energy supplier and distributor), which the State has largely and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a well with no funds.
Last year, it was 18 billion that had been navigated from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the elimination of environmental damage, to supplement retirement accounts, or to reserve for the reform of pensions that are being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit of 5.7% of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from being the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to victims of communism and crime, even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we forgive an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, Janota notes.
The Minister will then have to save money on the department's side or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a lack of 100 million in the State Fund project of a value of two billion, which must allow for online monitoring of the expenditures of each administration.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
Projects that have been revealed appear promising.
Just one button and you will switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American VMware company, which primarily deals with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can distinguish them in staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinovas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization on smartphones is nothing more than fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is on the increase.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test the virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices in 2012.
Snow shortages in the mountains track hotels
The desert trails pose no problem only to the farm-farm operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to cancel free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our website.
Internet users go through offers, ask for prices, but do not hesitate to book for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud in Christmas," said Martin Jandura, who operates the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate.
If the economy is given priority and the quality of the accommodation is only then, we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hotels offer only one week's stay for New Year.
I think they're going to try to put them in for a while, but they're going to give it up, too, and they're going to take shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The Ingtours du Vrchlabí tourism agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is the most interesting for the moment, it's not completely sold.
We still have half the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a few less expensive Christmas stays," Ingtours Petr Schiefert said.
The Vrchlabí Tourism Agency can also propose the New Year in Krkonoshe, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February are still well off, and the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoshe.
People expect her to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
On the contrary, the occupation of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have about five percent improvement.
There are a few places left for New Year as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February is also well sold," says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at four-and-twenty percent during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty in Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already had sixty percent of employment at the present time.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow up again has indicated the manager of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, the Krkonoše hotels should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be fresher and if there are precipitation, they should be snowed in the mountains.
But then, the time should warm up, Jiří Jakubský reports from the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeological institute.
United States: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, with which Barack Obama, President of the Council of Wise Men, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he considered to be very simple.
When he ended up sweating his doctrine so eagerly, it turned out that he had copied it to the carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use the word "as in Iraq" in the text several times, he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticised Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into a civilian war-consumed Iraq as being "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
However, the following months have shown that Bush's strategy, which was based on the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and most successful to the point that newspapers currently do not speak of Iraq as a whole.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that is to say, objectively speaking, left his successor a much more favourable final situation than one could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will reproduce
These are again campaign commanders who requested an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reticence of the White House despite the habit of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The President hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he destroyed at least the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He succeeded in exterminating the promise of 5,000 additional on the part of Europe, even though he originally had 10,000.
What leads to the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be its intention to remove Afghanistan's armies by 18 months and to complete this process by three years. Obama's entire doctrine raises more questions than it does not provide answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will produce the same fruits as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fraternal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing the day-to-day leader according to their arrangements.
The political institutions, although officially founded, will only see the dust behind which the patriarchal ethnic relations will be propagated.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "soon state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporary horizon of Obama's strategy makes parly perplexing its volunteerism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made it worse and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and outside of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the throes of war for their "soon return to the house" will bring a true miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible as the Taliban will consider it to be the indirect asset of the US defeat.
NATO's last summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is geared towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically change the situation is the evolution of Iran-related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and increased sanctions do not have an impact on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of a solution to the problem through military force.
There will have to be a response, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic return to the Afghan situation.
The only rustin for Obama is that it remains for three years until the presidential elections and therefore it remains long enough for it to plan on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will no longer receive cash premiums
High-ranking employees from the U.S. Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 main leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to sell back five years.
The actions may be withdrawn from the leaders if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus taking the lead in the effort to link salaries with long-term performances on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank has become the target of criticism after having set aside nearly $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, strong premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it was planning to charge a single rate of 50 per cent of the bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women won Nobel Prizes in all fields outside physics
These are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm from the hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in technical and literary disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received their compatriot Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The price of chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to clarify the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize for Economics, American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that had not won this year was physical.
This prize was given today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical lenses.
Each graduate received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (about EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward.
The highly anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over this afternoon to Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward, since it was only at the beginning of his journey and that it was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
He added that, in some situations, war is essential to peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who will stay with the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for the following year as voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the public finances crisis.
It was Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his role Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a 163 billion-dollar deficit that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the House of Deputies validated the proposals of the left on money transfers on Wednesday and increased the salaries of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government challenged the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would increase the budget deficit indirectly.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left of one, the government, Klaus and the right of the other, which called into question the future of Fischer's cabinet that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by Members, removes the package of economic measures passed by the Government of Fischer, which he believes should be owed to the State.
Klaus, who is able to ratify the State Budget Act but is not obliged to do so, said today during a small lunch of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long ignored the "serious problem" of the "unfettered deficit" of public finances.
In his view, there is currently no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve if it could rely on a consensus of larger political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is depleting and that the government should call into question its subsequent existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Neczas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dratic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is fading and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD has successfully ratified the State budget for the following year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will expose much to the world about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story speaks of sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor awarded to the Oscars, incarnates the film on Nelson Mandela's life, tireless fighting against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a 14-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate her in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The sixty-two-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in the Million Dollar Baby drama of Clint Eastwood, located in the middle of the box, has, for example, incarnate the leader of a movement against slavery, become a slave himself, a fictitious president of the United States, even God in the film Evan All-Powering but never one of the live anchors and so important for so many people as Mandela.
The former South African State man was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favor of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invasive and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the French South African rugby team to unify the country. President Mandela newly elected knows that his country remains and is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders of the world.
The South African team will end up making progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story on a large screen.
I didn't have any other purpose but to play this role so as to bring it closer to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be in bed before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to close his hand.
I realized that when I close my hand, I recover from your energy, it transmits itself, and I had the impression of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard environment of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I sounded at the door of the house, he opened up to me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienar was, 'I look a lot bigger in the film."
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus received positive feedback from the director of Eastwood and even expressed ambitions for the Oscars.
The critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety magazine summed up his appreciation of these words: "It's a very good story, a very well realized film."
In film reviews on Rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians were testing a rocket
An unknown foreign-born light phenomenon was observed above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence admitted only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental intercontinental ballistic fusion not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulva" type missile, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the run-off tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she was injured in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "Miss which doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but that shines
This 13th test usually took place at the beginning.
It's only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the device again.
It is obviously the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulva" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be fired by a moving and diving vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably faulty "Bulva".
After all, the Norwegians have no doubt for a moment that this is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk about failure at all.
The first two floors of the rocket have survived and only the third one has been affected.
In the previous cases, the engines have experienced failure on the first floor.
Although none of the tests were carried out without hooks, the management of the Ministry of Defence considered that only six out of thirteen had failed.
This nearly fifty percent success rate thus fills the generals of optimism and therefore they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly smoothly and will carry even ten hypersonal nuclear nuclei of a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with Cska Moscow at 51 years old
Legendary Defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a 51-year-old professional match.
The former world champion, the Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend hand in hand to his team of the Moscow Cska team in need and will probably make his entry at the match on Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who graduated from his forty-year career in 1998, is now the president of the Cska.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We still need to set out some details on the form, say the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchinov club, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of the other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and obtained 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous Fettisov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union, he awarded gold twice at the Olympics, seven world championships, triumphed at the Canada Cup and at the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he was also reaping the tributes in NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the hockey temple since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancelled all additional hours
The management of Noshovice's Hyundai factory has agreed with the unions to cancel all additional hours.
It is precisely because of the frequent extra hours that the unions reported an emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed it.
However, the management wants to further agree with the unions on a Saturday working this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, it is essential, that is why additional volunteer hours were proposed on Saturday, December 19, knowing there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a poster for the day worked on 28 November.
According to Vaněk, the company decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Whether they receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can take a replacement leave on December 28th, and thus extend their holidays of the end of the year indicated by Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for breakfast.
Given that additional hours were the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of trade unions as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, the management decided to cancel all additional hours for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, car factory employees were forced to work almost daily for two additional hours in more than eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The following negotiations between the car plant management and trade unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kucharæ said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the strike in case of agreement on their claims and signature of a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously became strikers due to unceasing extra hours.
They also protested against the bad conditions of wages and alleged bribery.
The management defended the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the requirements for the production of cars.
During the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also requested that no sanctions be imposed on workers who had ceased production.
Trade unions ask society to reduce the time spent in additional hours to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a salary of 5,000 kroner (209 €) for these.
The Hyundai car factory of Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It has made about 80,000 vehicles up to September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that works on HIV "endurance" also
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
This reality is, in some cases, the above on the fact that the combination is not as intense about the current variants of the virus as some medicines are already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the life of patients through a mixture of medicines that prevent the proliferation of HIV in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to combat the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarbons act on the responsible protein for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalocarbons are a mixture of copper, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the medicines used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their connections to the proteins of the virus.
The metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two blocks with multiple walls are formed by the atoms of copper, hydrogen and carbon and are connected by a metallic atom, in this case cobalt.
A virus that treats and resists.
HIV protease is a HIV virus protein that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease, there would be no generation of adult infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV prosthesis is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in tests as well as its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarbons is not as strong as on clinical medicinal products, but it does not weaken the resistant versions against which current medicinal products are often ineffective.
Therefore, metalocarbons, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are interesting combinations to look at to develop effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rézačová, director of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS is taking over in Fischer, who defends itself.
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek, described the budget as "efferent" ratified for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should call into question its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the statements of the ODS of drastic verdict.
He says take some time to analyze.
The ODS spokesperson Petr Neczas stated that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of the government should decide whether to join the House of Deputies in support of the minority who is concerned about combating the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the democratic social partners in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, however, with the proposals for changes of 12 billion crowns included in the left.
The House has increased staff salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's complaint against the proposals of the Social Democrats was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the Government's wishes as a modified budget is a less bad option than an interim budget.
Disappointment and worthlessness
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a feeling of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his office in the event of ratification of the amendments, the situation might be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota met with the Prime Minister on Monday after his transition to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he wondered if he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment at the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who have imposed the budgetary changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect sickness insurance, pensions, or reform of the Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the entire government.
The Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, said Topolánek in a textual communication from the United States.
He recalled that the Deputy Ministers of certain departments were calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to give up his resignation against the fact that he is fighting the amount of the government deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that he is based on the majority of the left that is currently in the Chamber."
That says, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda, then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer went to Brussels in the afternoon for a European Council debate.
The ODS has walked behind the Prime Minister's request.
At the same time, Nečas stressed that ODS would probably have voted on Wednesday against the modified budget if it had not expressly asked the democratic Members to allow the budget to vote.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, we are not small children, has he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been accused by the Chairman of the Party to the House or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I didn't notice that my vote would have failed.
I already knew at the time that I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the next few months would be a bolshevism of the House and a destruction of everything that had been positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules, there will be fewer trains for identical fares.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December some less-loaded express or regional trains and will strengthen some others.
The total coverage of transport will decrease on the day of entry into force of the new two-percent schedules compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a branch of pendolino.
On the contrary, an express ceased to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less rapid trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the biggest reduction in transport is the Hradec Králové region of eight per cent, in contrast to Prague and its surroundings can enjoy an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the line Prague - České Budějovice will only be reduced to a few days in the week.
Among the major transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esco Banlieu system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines towards the capital will have their final destination at the main train station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nadraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to the destination of Šumperk/Jeseník will start at intervals of two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13.
Billing this year for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in all four billion kroner to settle visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate at an altitude of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration has always been one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use an increase in prices for the large majority of transport titles.
Changes will only affect one day's ČD Net tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The eLiška price will again depend on the route, while until then it was valid between cities of a region at choice and at a single rate of 160 crowns.
More than 50 people are still detained by the Filipino rebels, children are released
Today, the rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed them, but spoke of the origin of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, rebels belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the army branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first pursued the rowers following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines due to a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested as a result of suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in the American halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against world-renowned apartheid was returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen by Mandela himself years ago to incarnate her.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the movie in the halls, the return of the critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvesu in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize next to Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film has great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is on the one hand fully prepared for the World Cup of Football, and on the other hand, because the media is alarming news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the people of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are at the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations issued to the main roles in which Hollywood stars "wander".
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the film, taking his own words.
I've dreamed of this role for many years and I've been well prepared.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to be able - as is said - to recover his energy, did he indicate at the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns each individual added.
Bring the mail from the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel by British writer John Carlin is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people portrays the South African human rights defender during his presidency.
Therefore, Morgan Freeman is trying to collect two racial groups from a long divided population, as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995 between the South African team's National Shirt on the world Cup floor, which South Africa had won at the time.
In order to show off on the peas in Shillot, which is considered something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been ovated long ago for fourteen years mainly from the white public and was recognized by the white population.
Let's hope that the football championship will be able to reunite people into one nation, said Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the trend in South Africa will improve.
However, the South African whites are sceptical as they have recently entrusted them in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer with tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire broke out in the morning a transformer from the company Čeps of the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukaš Marvan, Ustí firefighters spokesperson, there are six units operating on fire.
They used to let the transformer consume themselves, but they reviewed their opinion and set fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one has been injured and according to Pavla Mandatova's spokesperson, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the whole transmission.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She added that in ten years of activity, Čeps knew nothing similar and that incidents of this kind were isolated.
Power supply has not been interrupted, says ČEZ's spokesman for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution positions with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission sets to the distribution sets and lines of a length of 4339 kilometres.
Janchura will bring complaints for defamation against three Prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, is now filing a complaint for defamation against three democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Haszek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomouc Martin Tesarík region.
Jančura indicated it in twenty minutes of Radio Journal.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have completed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us were attacked and claimed to make the fine mouths, while only one offer was made for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
This is in exchange for slanders about Student Agency, Jančura said in the Radio Journal.
He also indicated that there was evidence that no region had taken place in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this for the European Commission.
Haszek believes that Mr. Jančura's complaint submission is the result of his media show, which serves him as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Haszek
Jančura has already reported last week that he will invest a few million crowns in advertising that will mention the unfavourable actions of the regions.
He told Radiojournal that he had interrupted the campaign after Christmas and that he was counting on it to resume after New Year's Eve.
He stated that the campaign would aim at corruption in a broad sense.
Jancura started her campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of approximately 150 billion crowns, without making calls for tenders.
According to Jancura, such an act is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to the threat of a member of the ČSSD to Jančura.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who he is, but I will not say his name, Jančura said in Radiojournál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voting is already taking place, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute has already set maximum prices for vaccines to be paid for sickness insurance.
Experts are also clear in the immunization process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination has started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid by themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year a quarter of families have voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcals.
However, the parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts believe that sick insurance costs 300 to 450,000 crowns per year at vaccine doses.
However, they save on medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the State spent about 500,000 crowns a year for the entire vaccination of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of middle ear inflammation but also of serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age were caused by Pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible future vaccination obligation.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský Association indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the experts were not really satisfied that we had an optional vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that needs to be followed now, said Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumococcals.
We are not looking at it at all for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeněn.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Paediatric Society, recognizes that a voluntary vaccination is based on its defects.
However, if all children were vaccinated, a reduction in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the optional vaccination" says Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that from next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination also breaks because it is the first vaccination of children funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free funds for prevention, thereby saving on future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
However, this is linked to the concerns of the practitioners' pediatricians, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy the vaccines by insurance, the doctors receiving them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the State.
Some Members feared, however, that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts of sickness insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to be paid back.
Paediatrics are estimated to have to individually invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important sum.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de museum"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal charts worth $20 million (12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interrogated while loading 90 tables in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to force the entrance of the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) press agency.
AP quoted a police officer as saying that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52 years old, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by whatever means, to transport the tables to a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta Senior refused to grant such an authorisation, the agency said.
Labour advocates an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers advocated an increase in tax and reductions in the expenditure announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism of opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the reduction of the deficit by deferring its decisions to the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the furs by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling on public salaries from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession that they are not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announced.
The decline in social insurance - which will bring about GBP 3 billion a year - has made the world of businesses angry, because he believes it is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a relaunch of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-budget report
Social Insurance will still increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will decline even more than 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in the company's profits tax for small companies has been abandoned
Discounts on taxes on electric cars and windmills
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person who earns 30,000 GBP will lose GBP 90 per year and a person who earns 40,000 GBP will lose GBP 190 per year, while a person who earns 10,000 GBP per year will gain GBP 110 per year.
Ministers stated that their goal of reducing the deficit by half before 2013 was "hard decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be charged on the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, rejected an increase in tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditure was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that economic growth would begin again at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be met - have been questioned after the Chancellor has been forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - worse than the fall of 3.5% predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the estimate.
"Failure missing"'
The Conservatives who will launch this Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the Labour debt crisis said that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, added, "cynically" to difficult elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, chief secretary of the phantom Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Force stresses that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would result in a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems stated that the money collected through tax increases and expenditure cuts would be used to support the expenditure of next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the political editor of the BBC, said that the schedule of ads - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Force stresses that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish expenditure details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public expenditure restrictions would only begin to feel in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Estudes Fiscales) has stated that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only delayed," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report, and the markets are aware of it."
The FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates arrest in Pakistan by five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
Men were arrested at a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab , the US Embassy announced in Pakistan, the BBC.
The FBI stated that it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the United States of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they're American citizens, of course, we'd like to know what the charges are against them and what conditions they're under," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, a spokesperson for the FBI, said that the agency had been aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if it is true that students are missing," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington claimed that men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncles.
She said that the house had already been monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, refused any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters Press Agency, but stated that the United States had to "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been taken away from their home by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty Condemns Iranian "Abuse"
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as poor as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Tens have been sentenced to prison and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
"False confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ibrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of "Working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half consciously, said Amnesty.
In August, the missing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that demonstrators held after the election had been tortured to death in prison and others had been raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate the post-election disorder and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested during the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski trails built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park has attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill park track, a small tramp was ahead of a 100m-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view of the top of the track was magnificent but that it was rather intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining in counters.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volgits - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's festival, the snow will be left at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's last book, "Why the French don't like the crowd" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and worried the country for over 50 years and whose effects are still felt today.
The last book by Mr. Bowen presents a much wider and more ambitious picture.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls the "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen and reproduce discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Does a Muslim have to marry in a mosque or in a mansion (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a bank system based on interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers from a Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who are now a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the laity of the French might be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the intellectual guardian so virulent of laity) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spared, compared with Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than increasing pragmatism, it detects a "treasure of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The Darkest View in the World
The Arctic changes faster and dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it is melting at an alarming rate, with it a life that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their silage.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, author and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
He is familiar with the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, describing the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved them by hunting white bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous at the age of 14 who had no intention of fighting but the point of his moustache, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught while swimming beside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 hours at the same time.
Even today, the size of a zoo is always a millionth of the surface needed for a free adult. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of the algae that push into its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis recounts the stories of other writers and historians and often repeats the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Indians in Motoski use powerful rifles to hunt their prey.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of the hunt that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and clear summary of the Arctic science and an insightful view of what the future might be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately report the rate of change.
It's not wrong to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneer trips provided the first information on the source of the iceberg.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the relief changes under that.
Satellite surveillance and iceberg probes are of great help, but the biggest of the work is done by tough men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by the ice-pressed saltwater threads.
But of the bears mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Des Marines, among the 6,000 people who have deposited crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of Angelo Robinson, 19 years old, made a seven-hour bus trip to deposit a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, in North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to saluting men and women who were once in their place.
Within a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to deposit crowns on the graves of the veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travels every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the cemetery in Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of the 93 United Airlines flight in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charlene Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a retired career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emitoufled in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the palm trees and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen old graves, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as from the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers have said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children were playing and the couples were holding their hands, wearing fresh pin crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a little red papillo node on top.
Nearly there was silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan were inhumane.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the shadow mood of the current wars increased the area.
Individuals would cry without hiding, others would pray and families and friends would support themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others hung up to see the small black and white information cards, embedded in the wet soil for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears at the tomb of her son.
She was part of Zanesfield, Ohio, and had spent eight hours coming to gather at the tomb of Sergeant Marine Gunney David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free to do... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American citizen who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the Department of Foreign Affairs services.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana try to have access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husband and wife are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country for rewards, but his authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government take concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although these are new and desired consumer goods in a country or a staff member's average salary is $15 per month.
This year alone, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation corresponding to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for such crimes as drug trafficking, Gloria Berbena says, a press connection with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be permitted -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Human Rights Watch Group program, recently published a severe report on the freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick elderly brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often has a negative reaction to the United States, at a time when the two countries started a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified an organization that was supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would result in the dismantling of an important network of terrorist recruits on the Internet for the search of radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video site.
When they arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them join the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, the al-Qaida home and its terrorist training camps.
However, a representative of Pakistani secret services who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the commanders of al-Qaida that these men were not taking part in the CIA's conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east became a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed himself on the condition of keeping the anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to enter the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of the recruits in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining the individuals in whom they trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US secret services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruits play the role of barrier guards, refusing to enter those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are studied closely by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their advertising value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups should also be more and more careful in choosing the people they accept in recent years because US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protestors in Copenhagen demand a "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked the streets, here on Saturday, demanding more action on the climate of the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center Congress.
The number of protesters was estimated to be 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit up a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day that little was done during the discussions on the United Nations-sponsored climate, thousands of activists walked through the city, displaying banners in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring 'The Earth says it has enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish model and photographer's top, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's native country, Peru, opened her eyes to the devastating problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change that is already taking place."
That is one of the reasons why I have decided to join the great march -- to make the word pass and to appeal to the leaders of the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or having pocket knives.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that she had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or having pocket knives.
According to one passerby who asked to keep the anonymity because of his involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing masks and black clothing lit several explosives near the main canal of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by a few departments.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first of all rockets followed by "a few large explosions".
Within the Palais des Congresses, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters failed to raise the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, a representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it was something I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "Because the event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that the walk might seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It is of interest to the general public and to various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal differences between races
Last week's federal report on the results in mathematics provided good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the headquarters, the report shows that Grades 4 and 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress over the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is apparent from the latest figures of the National Assessment of Education Progress is the continuing gap between the results of African-Americans and whites on both local and national levels.
The average results of the white children in Grade 4 (cm1) in Washington D.C. have increased from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased from three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success actually increased between 2007 and 2009, ranging from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling from only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view of a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between the black and white grade 4 (cm1) class, when the first NAEP District report was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Director of Education Group Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Maire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not jump out of joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic Apparatus), Member of the D.C. Council, whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary ( Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown stated that the message of test results is that middle schools (colleges) in the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what scares us is that we don't spend enough time and energy on our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at the end-of-life schools of elementary school and college starters who have not integrated the reading bases earlier in their school course and who are rather late compared to their friends.
Every day, the math program, for the Kindergarten (mother) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real life games and experiences, as they were established in the District by the former head of Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue to work to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than that of the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of NAEP raise the question whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at Berkeley University in California who is studying the results of city testing.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest areas of Washington.
This target can also have political implications that generate this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendent of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, will be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the key elements in reducing the gap of success was the length of the traditional public school, today 180 days in Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, says Janey, who came to an agreement with the teachers' union last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "start point" to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long stretch.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, is down and blinks a moment in sight of white columns, brick facades and greening hair.
Graciela's parents could only finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Thus, while she and other students from Grade 8 (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where the tuition costs are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of a newly impressed student than an enthusiastic student.
Super Here's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, while the guide led them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she says dreamy, when she is told the low ratio of law teacher - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely asked for the large number of American children born from Hispanic immigrant parents who have left high school where they have become parents at adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic of the "second generation" over five years of his studies in high school -- a remarkable success if it is considered that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without having finished high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they are opening the way for the next generations to play an important role in the country's work.
Researchers studying drummers claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from motherhood to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared to you), it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that start when students of low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil gets agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two trials that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry in Iraq, which is disabled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are divided into only two of the 10 fields for tenders.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who had put a stake in it has lost.
Two U.S. companies have obtained contracts for the fields for tenders in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, they were Asian and European companies that opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum forum, a website for information on the Internet.
It will take a lot of time before another bid is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday, and political instability while American military troops retreated, have stopped American oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest oil reserve in the world, say analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivers, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have given it their technical advice, have distributed empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., detained by the State, has been more engaged in contracts than other companies and is divided with important participation in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and will meet its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies submitted tenders made bids which were then compared to the barium tariff that the Department agreed to pay to justify production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It appears that a US missile, which hit the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, reported on Friday to US anti-spionage authorities.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchic tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of Pakistani civilian secret services, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
Representatives of the authority stated that the suspected local militants rushed on site and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally decapitated bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two anti-terrorist U.S. representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of Al-Qaida military organizers leading terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, he said one of the authorities who wanted to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic signs of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somalia had made rapid progress in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the large American public, but it does not reduce the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second major character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a group of militants in the tribal belt, and three other operators.
The pace of the attacks by the CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures developed by the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit target group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability, while also impetuously killing suspected informants, the site states.
The United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would resign from his post in March at the end of a turbulent mandate with widespread allegations of corruption during the United Nations presidential elections.
The departure of Eide took place while the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States calendar for withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send a good signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition to Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign but that he would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already begun to search for a replacement.
The representatives claimed that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it was an Italo-Switzerland citizen who recently chaired a United Nations mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and of dissipating evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which were thanked -- "were detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism with regard to the international observation of the elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations Responsibilities to authorize their successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than they are assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in the way their money is spent.
Eide expressed her frustration about the limitations of her powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations recruitment regulations denied her opportunities to bring new talents.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must be subject to additional sanctions
The Secretary for Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of his inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramaticized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a denial.
One of the things that bothers me most is that if I've learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it's the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He stated that "a set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would be in fact less secure with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesperson, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full compliance with the United Nations Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In its discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his rich uranium storage, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has promoted such an agreement, a way to develop confidence on both sides and to make time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have been far away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's ratification of some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not contemplated, in terms of major additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set 31 December as a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before turning to other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unsubstantiated allegations" of certain members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue the talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich oil region of Kurdish in order to defeat the troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in American plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurdish anxiety about suspended retirement. The US authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
In ageing China, a change in direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up displaying propaganda, saying, "The earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby, it's an extra grave."
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneously and firmly: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
There is no second left, Wang, 31 years old, Human Resources Director and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children, known for their good games and games, called "the little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while the population is expected to explode from 60 years of age, from 16.7% of the population in 2020 to 31.1% in 2050, is well above the overall average of approximately 20%.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population Commission and Family Planning) stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive attenuation
The Chinese policy of the single child, written in the Constitution of the country in 1978, is, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation imposed by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay enormous fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and to suffer discrimination at the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities forced pregnant women from a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys and girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually adopted their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they added many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, at the University of Beijing, stated that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In a matter of time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorisation.
The city's government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at their home, and slide prospectuses at their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those wishing to have more than one child.
According to the family planning manager, the answer was disappointing.
Dissatisfied response
Although managers in a rural town in the Shanghai suburbs say they have seen an increase in requests for couples' files wishing for a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have children anymore.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, stated that they would worship two children and that they were legally authorized to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and the life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The West consider the policy of the single child to be a right issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
True, we steal the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she wanted only a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and we had the habit of everyone taking care of us."
We don't have the habit of caring for someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it more cruelly.
For couples working in two, middle class, which reduces the birth rate, he says, it is necessary to be selfish as well as successful.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he said.
Even one child demands a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his/her CV to get a place in the best maternal place."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has plans for emission reduction
The conference on climate, sponsored by the United Nations -- so far, characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has returned under the light of the Friday ramp, because of the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialised nations with most burdens, in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it clarified the path to be taken.
But it has been seen as an important advance in the negotiations that lack time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not say how many rich countries would give to the poor to support climate, in the short term and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of global warming that those responsible would be prepared to tolerate.
He gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequiyt, Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on the climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions from 25 to 45 per cent in 2020 compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also resumed negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal changes occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States representative for climate negotiations, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if these were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming tougher towards China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei stated that the US chief negotiator, either lacks "good sense", or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China to combat climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major global powers at stake, defects occur both in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist on the fact that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should be costed by the reduction in greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, who is also the Climate Adviser for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put pressure on them to obtain a treaty legally binding in Copenhagen, although most major participants said that negotiations would lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which meets 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission's climate unit, said that the small island states' action "has put political pressure on the complete political process", in part because they are now united and they ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in court before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Environment of India, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister came down from their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend house-to-house meetings and information conferences, in order to be able to make claims that will be studied during the following week.
The true image of the assembly -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des Congresses every day -- guitar players present night performances that mock, betray and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the Grand Court, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the International Conservation Policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first 225 km/h train will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a stroke of shuffles will strike the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed train will reach 225 km/h, while it will range from Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become thriving suburbs, the duration of business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing bottlenecks on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties joined this project.
But the ten billion books needed to build a new iron network, the inevitable planning battle, and the fear of threats to the environment risk hindering high-speed British lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow you to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next scheduled stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn in five metres from the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be designed up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will have three options for a high-speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The privileged options are put forward in a configuration in Y for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west of the Pennins in Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle against Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best option of performance," said a rail professional.
When this is completed, the time of travel between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour's journey currently.
The proposals will allow you to travel to 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow trains 400 m long and capable of transporting 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
The railway industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if he launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to travel out of high-speed lines on existing railways in North Birmingham, preserving travel periods between London and Scotland up to three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure the passage of aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for the revolution of the railway.
The taxpayers repay the GBP 75,000 loan for Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his district.
The party's leader, whom David Cameron was retiring to complain that the members of parliament were "maintained", increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a chain extension to his second house in Rutland.
Additional interests, amounting to hundreds of books per month, were allowed to be paid to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons received complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a control of members' expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in the district of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the office of emoluments states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation conducted by the Committee on Commons Privileges and Standards concerning its pre- borrowing arrangements.
The Committee has convicted him last month of any non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the loan of GBP 271,406 from his London property to his constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of loan interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The variable standard interest rate RBS rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of the Commons authorities shows that Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Head of the phantom cabinet in September, after a journalist under cover filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you must live "on budget" and you are treated as "the m...e"
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small piece, based on what was right.
and I could have asked more secretly, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former oil trading position, began to explain his expenses in May, after it had appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the office of charges that this could be considered "excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of £ in the hair of M Duncan, to protest after it was revealed that he had requested GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan, last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, both approved by the cost office and by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of decoupling or developing or using the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, permitted, etc.
It couldn't be more clear or simpler."
Faithful, come all to see Brighton's Advent schedule
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way of promoting for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration by creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for every day of December, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30, every day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-remunerated priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We hope that religion will be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old foreign building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people protested on Saturday to claim an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred interviews.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of people, according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the Danish capital, in the margins of the United Nations Conference on Climate, which was responsible for reaching an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate across the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the court, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, broke down the windows with punches and hammers, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emotional police officers immediately intervened without a home.
In total, the police announced the involvement of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to the members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolent groups, which had been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were called "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were always held on Saturday night street "remained and kept in position despite extreme cold".
Parliament's party, the court, rather good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped at about 500 meters from the building, without searching to penetrate it.
A scene had been set to welcome the planned speakers, before watching the candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters had come to the car and to the big cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for the most part in blue waterproof sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue seams" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say that we have time, we have estimated the Bennian singer Angélice Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, watercourses where we can walk as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the internationalist movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alternativeism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen to "read climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no breaking between the fight against climate warming and the fight against another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, showed up in red, booming bananas with solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, meetings of several hundred demonstrators were also held to demand vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network gathered several hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (est).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Abkhazia separatist elected her president, Georgia denouncing a "face"
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow's recognition of Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region, while Tbilisi denounced a "face".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure, according to the heads of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five high-ranking candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the ballot.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "regregates that Abkhazia falls under the total occupation of Russia", said Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, which made several thousand deaths, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, AFP, who said he voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the poll office in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region to the horrendous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located a little around this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials who have come to monitor the vote.
We, the Abkhazia people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, speaking to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, by raising a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over abkhase railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither the current power nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have walked around the world on Saturday to claim an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, on the one hand, have called nearly 700 people in the middle of an impressive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosted delegates from 193 countries until 18 December in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament's part, the overall good child court, took the lead in the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped at about 500 metres from the center, without seeking to penetrate it.
A scene had been set to welcome the planned speakers, before watching the candles with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the court, a group of several hundred demonstrators, fully dressed in black, brick and hammered, broke windows, found an AFP journalist.
They were immediately surrounded by anti-emotional policemen, and they intervened without homelessness, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the involvement of 600 to 700 people, stating that it was mainly members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolent groups that had been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was wounded by a paddle and four cars burned near a squad in accidents that led to the impalement of twenty people, according to the police.
We saw the extremist groups, had prevented the police spokesperson, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order's forces were turning to the sky.
Most of the demonstrators, who came into and out of the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for the most part in blue waterproof sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue seams" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say that we have time, we have estimated the Bennian singer Angélice Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are streams of water where we can walk when we have never done so before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the internationalist movement approached environmental organizations.
French MP José Bové, a figure of alternativeism, told the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen "to read climate justice and social justice": "today there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight against another world".
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish engineer Helena Christensen, the former United Nations refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, showed, red clothes and bananas boasting solar energy in front of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, meetings of several hundred demonstrators were also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network gathered several hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (est).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The geo-history strengthens the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "strengthened" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in a scientific terminal.
Now students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Mr Chatel.
For the minister, "you have to get out of the hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S branch is no longer a scientific branch" but "largely, it concentrates on the best students".
The ES and L can't remain S's subsidiaries, he goes on to say, "I haven't heard a lot of historians and intellectuals getting angry about the absence of terminal history-geography in technological colleges."
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69%) French rejected the government's project to eliminate the mandatory teaching of geography in Terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this abolition, as well as the left and some right-wing electors.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was not "no question" to delete the philosophy of terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of protesting against the project on Tuesday, which they consider to be the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will undergo an admissibility test at the beginning of the year which will cover their discipline, and then at the end of the year a admission test at the end of the year which will cover their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will follow internships during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of students as interns.
If you add all the courses offered before the competition, you will already get more attendance in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he has continued.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "by 2012".
A Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: it was the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Normal School on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day of a series of interventions of experts, fifteen minutes each, filmed and opened to the public, found a journalist of the AFP.
We wanted to do something that caught people and gave them a desire to know more about it, explained in the margins of the 22-year-old Edward Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this day who took his name from that given by the students to the fish in the school pool.
Twenty participants are selected from among the experts in their discipline and are selected for their charismatic side, has it been specified?
About climate warming, "you can talk for hours, but you can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with the help of graphics, in front of 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he pointed out, hoping that the auditors will believe that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos taken from these conferences will be posted on the school site from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The prison supervisors called on "general mobilization" on Friday to demand payment by the end of the year of the additional premiums and hours for which payment was deferred in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-prisoner (2nd Union of Supervisors) asked staff who would not be in service on Tuesday morning to appear before and "block them" in order to "denominate the theft of their debts".
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union) calls them "to meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for strong mobilization", judging them not to pay in December "additional hours, nights, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to bring up discontent and anger".
The Department of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the additional hours have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellor stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the trade unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts of staff to operate and modernise our prison system, wrote the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which is due to a poor assessment of the number of additional hours, does not reproduce in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be poor, except for management staff who benefit from the famous premium of functions and objectives, has deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for which "the budgetary constraints are well behind".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional FO union of Marseille was angry, announcing its decision to boycott up to the new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, the same for additional hours, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time when our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our staff, it is more than regretful to bear to take over the staff's money, the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux estimates.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less affected than others.
But in any case the account is not there, the Secretary General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "slower things" than those he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first Christmas in the family at the White House, has entrusted the little Oprah Winfrey screen with a simple gift rule: "I give more expensive things than I receive".
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on Sunday evening on the ABC chain, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious stay.
Even Bo, the little four-legged partner of the family will be part of it.
The Christmas Father also loves Bo, so said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "surely" a gift, according to the extracts of the broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama lied about her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he received: "Of course not, I offered you some nice gifts last year," said the president.
Was he absolutely obliged to give up before replying in a humour with his finger pointing out the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who offered you this?"
During this one-hour show, in the uncontracted atmosphere, with the famous cheerleader who was a keen supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his father Kenyan had rarely seen offered him to Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father coming to see us for Christmas and when he gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
It's only a long time later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this balloon.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL claims he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to important "injury" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old Rocker was re-operated on Wednesday night to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï de Los Angeles Hospital after the American doctors had found "the injuries resulting from the operation" of the discale hernia in Paris on November 26th, indicated in Paris his service of the press, stating that these injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", but announced that a new medical bulletin would be communicated by no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last tour of the singer, however, Johnny Hallyday would have been immersed in an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens his eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources" no drains would have been put after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for this discale hernia.
The intervention, programmed for several days by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the arts.
This was not available on Thursday evening to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for a subsequent infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, said on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but he made sure he didn't take any care of the rocker, which is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a dump because it took 12 hours to fly after such an operation, it's not playable, said Eddie Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "enduated".
Mr. Camus also said that he had been in contact with Laeticia, the wife of the singer, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had discovered that he had been operated with a "little colon cancer", then with a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, his surroundings even had to decompose a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small bassin: Bousquet's first on its fetish distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-way medalist at the 2009 World Cup, awarded an international title on Thursday on a distance he particularly loves, the 50 m free swim, at Euro-2009 in a small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are authorized for the last time has seen only three world records beat while waiting for a deferral.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 Nails and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 Nails.
A regret for Bousquet, who was looking for the world record of the 50 m free, with the mark in large pool (20.94).
On one of the two queens of the swimming distance, the 50 m free, is the 28-year-old French who was imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took their first international departure against eight usually.
Bousquet advanced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had planned.
We can always dream better and on the occasion, I said that if the world's record was at my fingertips, I was going to try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from January 1.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended up in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations did not serve this time in Germany Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records to the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering the mark he held on 400 m of free swimming (3:32.77) but was imposed by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give a shit about this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola charged $1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, clearly beyond his estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This two-metre-long panel of 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and baccants, is a rare part, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice-president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's, explained to the AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still under way, but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have so far been most interested, indicated to the AFP a spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abernerthy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made an element of her bathing in her Parisian special hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic of France and briefly President of the Council prior to the accession to the power of the Petin Marshal.
There was a 50-year-old shadow zone.
By exploring the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an open "Emile Zola succession" in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rugon-Macquart".
Attempt to leave Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered on Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the President-in-Office of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had been refused a life-long run by the Putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for making this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
When he arrived in Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government's plane was sent to his place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "dissign" and to ask for political asylum abroad to grant him extra-conduct.
But the rejected president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the guest head of state.
The Putschist government "successeded in wanting me to give up (...), they wanted me to resign," Mr. Zelaya said on Thursday at the Globe Radio, on which he often expressed himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some deals with the rejected president, who has been refugees to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's embassy has submitted us a request for extra-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum applications, the Interior Minister of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday to the Honduran HRN radio.
I did not ask for asylum in any country, I had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur chain, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to become the president of the Honduras people, he said.
The starters of Mr. Zelaya had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the President's resignation, who had gathered around the Brazilian Embassy, where the military had strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Putschist government.
This shows the marginal nature of this government with respect to international standards, he considered.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overturned on June 28, the day he had held a popular consultation to prepare his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he was surprised to return on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he does, he will be arrested for responding to the crime of "high treason" whose charge of justice, according to the Putschist government.
Putschiste President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial ballot recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, the US trade balance figures testifying to the resumption of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones earned 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq , with dominant technology, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index was adjusted to 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news from various economic pans, Lindsey Piegza, of the Financial FTN, was judged.
But it remains anecdotal, has it temperatured, considering that the market focused on "the glass half full".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts looked forward to a rise in the deficit.
Imports also increased as exports increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major US trading partners, Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com, commented.
On the other hand, the new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against any expectations last week, to reach 474,000 applications.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "has fallen to the lowest in one year", said Scott Marcouliler, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The mandatory market has fallen.
The 10-year-old Treasury return rose to 3,482 per cent on Tuesday evening and the 30-year-old to 4,492 per cent on 4.408 per cent on the watch.
Cuba: hundreds of power supporters consecrate the "white ladies"
A few hundred Cuban government supporters consecrated on Thursday wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
A quarter of "white women", married or close to political prisoners, were conjured up in the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the center of the capital to claim the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP noted.
At the bottom of the Yankees!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" were scanning, the raised point, the supporters of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came to "ensure their protection".
The guard, a similar event had taken place against the "white ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also prepared to manifest themselves on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were, called by civil police, a journalist of the AFP.
Policemen have forced dissidents into civilian vehicles who have been confiscated by government supporters, according to this journalist.
Dissident interactions in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "white ladies" had organised an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to the dissidentity, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda was a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remained in lockdown.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "merceners" or "agents" in the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rarely, Cuban television reported the manifestation of Thursday pro-governmental militants against "counters-revolutioners".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A coroner kills an octogen on the knife and kills 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed man with two knives killed an octagonist and injured five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influenza, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker would have hit with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an octogen, in or in front of an 85-boulevard Jean-Jaures, had learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Grievously wounded, the old man, born in 1929 under the responsibility of the Alliance police union, died at the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or before this same pharmacy, he then took it to a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged about 30 years, was intertwined and injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogen collapsed.
The days of the other injured are in danger, and vital organs are apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then made a malaise and would have been hospitalized "as a shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then run away in the street, always bulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passersby, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, this last scratch.
The scenario was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two knives carrying him in a cross behind his back, explained on-site a union officer of the Alliance in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to evidence collected by the AFP, tried to control the force.
I've seen a guy in his 30s with a green dress.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was expensive, said Alberto, a server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
At the height of No.61, two municipal policemen, their leaders, tried to implode the armed man and were wounded by punches, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many trades.
Passersby came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very serious abdominal wound, told the AFP Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of thirty years arrived, wounded by a knife.
These are the national police officers who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Parquet seized from the investigation the Departmental Judicial Police Service of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The coroner was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source has not excluded him from being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
It was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all the forces of this species whose forces are decoupling under the influence of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer once again claims abandonment of prosecution
French-Polish film lawyer Roman Polanski once again claimed in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), the abandonment of prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a more than 30-year moror case.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", complained before three judges of the second district of California about serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of the charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has been dead since -- would have discussed, before rendering his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: lost and wanted" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally stated at the end of September that he had "false" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to give up the proceedings, Mr. Hummel claimed the holding of a trial, which would enable him to present the evidence of his arguments.
The accusation reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never given his feet to the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor of the county of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, thus stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself to the audience."
In this case, we want to send the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, who is it possible to escape?, Mrs. Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "calls for favor in court, but disregards her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that there were "other alternatives to escape".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one asking to abandon the persecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecutions.
Recalling that his client no longer tolerates being harassed at every rebound of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to reside in his Gstaad chalet, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, blocked by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market drawn between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar increase: Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is mounted from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, which is the dominant technology, has left 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index has advanced from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low, and I think that will remain the case by the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's opinion on the robustness of economic recovery", analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of membership and much more than expected.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers rose sharply in December, to 73.4 versus 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes have been blocked by a new development of the dollar, up to two months ago against the euro, which "moves down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost ground.
The mandatory market has fallen.
The 10-year-old Treasury return rose to 3.540 per cent against 3.482 per cent on Wednesday evening and the 30-year-old to 4.497 per cent against 4.492 per cent on watch.
The election of Miss World once again in South Africa
After a month of travel across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are ready to break the last line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already cancelled their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss sports or Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and the Cape was wonderful.
I've seen so many things and lived so many experiences, says Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, northern Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15h00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the summer heat.
For young Russians, his second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with candidates and the rediscovered "of landscapes to cut the blow in this country".
After a month of galas, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
The Indian Poja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presents to this election, as well as those of Ashwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming Bollywood stars.
It's the dream of every woman being crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's just the appearance.
We are the embassies of our country and I want to come home with the crown, launch Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in the bathrobe.
The show will be animated by a TV performer, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a committee manager, Miss Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knew to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, assures Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed local cuisine.
In exceptional circumstances, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who closed their hands.
Not current for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will undoubtedly remain to the Cape Town (South-West) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote a little more event.
I've been with people I never thought I could approach.
I'm definitely coming back for the World-2010, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", he assured his son David on Friday at Los Angeles airport where he was to go to his father's hair hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it is very well done, said the press David Hallyday on his departure from the plane that took him to Paris shortly after 1 p.m. (21h.G.T.).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured him that he was going to go to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a subsequent infection with the operation of a discotheque hernia on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "put in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by the doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for a subsequent infection to the operation of a discale hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated on Wednesday night to Thursday due to major injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade, to attend a school show, found a photographer of the AFP.
The chief of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer has violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the Monceau International Park Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were aliens, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday was "too soon to leave for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this on-line doctor who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and it was amazing, since I myself had two disco hernies, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "drainless, nothing", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsburg to absorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor of sulphurous reputation, condemned several times by justice, in medical records, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" pursuing "regularly" before the Council of the Order, which is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well done" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems to be among the parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8th (at Amiens, ndlr) as planned, seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Association increases the tone and adds the New Centre to no longer use its seal
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem de François Bayrou, responded on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the ex-Giscardian party, while retaining it to use it on no support, subject to judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claimed the property of the UDF brand to be the first to deposit it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be held, came out of silence to launch a stay for the minister and the MP, suming them to stop using the seal and to transfer the property of the brand to them, subject to judicial proceedings.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you would propose to your political movement to +retake+ the UDF stamp, write the association in an e-mail signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow on your campaigning material and on your site's watch page, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the today's logo + UDF+, also found the signatories of the mail.
Since you do not ignore it, you have no right to use this seal, explains the UDF office that keeps the NC to remove "immediately the name of the UDF from any support and from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (la) brand to its legitimate right-holders".
If you did not do so, the courts would be required to comply with the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories will prevent.
In their e-mail, they state that the UDF "is a whole political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "choose" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continued, "when he filed the trademark", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
It scandalously and fraudulently exploits the absence of the deposit of the UDF acronym to do so on its behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they say, before ironing on the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worth making a name by itself than trying to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that we are not entitled to."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as alleged by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he benefited from an octogeneary's weakness for the spoiling of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars, will be tried on 15-16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and an amendment of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which both mother and daughter lay while holding the back of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that a medical expert from Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collectively by three doctors.
L'Oréal's main heir and shareholder has always refused to submit to such a review, in any case under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Parquet during the investigation.
Doctors designated on Friday will have to report before 10 March 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt has been able to find herself in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to him about it. He told the lawyer Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, at the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent new one (...) The expert will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we have to protect, has he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been involved in criminal prosecutions against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and an artist who has been involved, who claims to have benefited for years from her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, who she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' complaints sometimes turned to the big family riot on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was mistaken for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the e-mail dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years?
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since his marriage."
For his part, the Nanterre prosecutor once again found that the complainant was not eligible for action, as long as a court of all cases refused to do so in these last days to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in justice, she is not protected and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, a representative of the public ministry.
The court finally decided that it would take place once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the great French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees, recalls the position of the companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to make employees join certain "values" as it used to be, to impose on consumers products thought of by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies to win the markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products of customer preference factors returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can result in mortifying demortification.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects the frameworks in particular.
This demobilization seriously affects the development of all the company's intellectual functions, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a prospective vision" ; it requires employees to make an undertaking that the revenue from the management is totally contrary to.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the core of the business's concerns to the same extent as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion investigations
Internal opinion polls – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to his employees – will they encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I have been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after a long time, to do what she has always done.
- Then, because of authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple view of human behavior.
From major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactivated by the United States-based "neursciences" and widely disseminated, in turn, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to make the "Leviers" (sic) of the framework commitment, a recent survey of Ipsos appears in Le Figaro.fr is comforting the leaders in a position of mechanical governance, which is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution required for the proper functioning of modern enterprises is supposed to adopt a final vision of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a fundamental statement into any reasoning or practice of governance: for employees, the undertaking for the company is possible only if it clearly appears to be a means of achieving a part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their business by relying on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and restore their human resources management "in place".
They thus create an area conducive to concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "just war" is worth the praise to the right in Obama
U.S. law hailed the farewell speech delivered on Friday in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had disrupted the award of the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former candidate for the vice-chairman in the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, said Mrs. Palin, the sister of the right wing of the Republican party, to the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that had just been published.
The war is of course the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over the place, did she?
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, used Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On the other hand, I found this historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected by some as a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential election said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not return a prize of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's old pen reconverted chronicler to Washington Post, Mr. Obama said "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting themselves as "citizens of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they don't do much to preserve it," said Mr Gerson.
Among the rare to the right to be unconvinced, a falcon of the Bush era, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "tender, ampouled and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
To the left of the President, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When war is involved in the notion of justice, it can easily justify the massacre of innocents, has it been warned.
However, the press of the Gauche-Central remained laudable instead of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel was provisionally assigned to Mr. Obama, described his speech as "superproduction" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should be used as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", burned the California daily.
Mr. Obama "prepared the speech he needed," said the New York Times, the judge "both dark and building".
Routes: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, road trade unions and Tlf, the only employer organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended with the word strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoice" of this agreement, after several negotiations, began on Wednesday morning.
After a second discussion night, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And even if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting to begin at 11 a.m. so that everyone would agree and that the text would be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year parties," said Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
At hourly rates, for low wages, "we move from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a big deal, but we're going very far, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
So we're going to order our militants that there are no locks, no locks from the food centers.
But we can always have some recalculators that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "hard to grant increases on high wages in the light of international competition".
According to him, increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and between 100 and 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revalidation of the travel costs of 3% and the maintenance of the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, inter alia, address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of €100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending financial law for 2009, voted on Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical terms".
The signing of the TLF allows for the agreement to be applied in the first time to enterprises which are members of this organization, and in the second time to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
She will become "in the shortest possible time", said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denouncing a "dupe market", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to contradict the next wake-up dinner, Unostra has regretted.
For the other, the agreement risks "creating the tomb of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disorders this weekend, unhappy unions of RATP's proposals
The RER A, France's largest urban transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday to the 2nd day of strike between the unions and the management of the RATP left them hungry as to their application for a premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains between 10h00 and 20h00, due to a two-way train on the central section (La Défense and Nation) and a four-way train outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galeries, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, are delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve large shops".
The RER A through the west is the Parisian accumulation.
The short version of the RATP from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train on two ran at peak hours, and almost no branch in crunch hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on which the Franciscans were organized.
Thus, in the morning, the St.Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less frequent than usual, especially because of the absence of colleges and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour early in order to be sure to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazar station did not know of saturation, said the SNCF, who had planned an arrangement of officers and command forces.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or shared from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general congresses of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, considered "maigres" by the unions, of a meeting with the board of directors Friday afternoon.
The Director of RRs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RRs A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a first due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its proposals for parentheses, angered the CGT, stressing that the management "was not prepared to solve a problem while in the roads and the SNCF it was done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a wider review of the working conditions", said RATP.
What also made the unions say that the company "was laughing at the users of the weekend".
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, who so far refused any discussion during the strike, suggested that the meeting should be "in an interest in reparation".
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, after a notice has been filed by Unsa and Independents.
Unions apply for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line to the daily millions of travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, reach from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros premium, for their scheduled holidays, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court pronounced the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party on Friday, a decision that was immediately followed by protests of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision is likely to complicate the Government's task, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DPP) was dissolved because it had become a "house of harmful activities to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", the President of the Court Hasim Kilic told the press after four days of debate.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified seven-vote majority was required to pronounce the dissolution, Mr. Kilic said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and Member Aysel Tugluk, are political life bonds for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the Party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders had predicted before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as legislators without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Abdurrahman Yalçinaya Court of Cassation, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it has no "organic links" to the PKK but refuses to qualify as the terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court intervenes while the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in order to seek to withdraw the support of the Kurds to the PKK and to end the conflict.
DTP leaders had stated that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the southeast Anatolian, where many protests against the conditions of detention of the head of the PKK Abdullah Öcalan have been degenerate in trouble with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators have gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east populated mostly of Kurds.
Order forces pulled lacrymogenic grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched molotov cocktails or stones, with frogs.
A hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the Court's decision would "increas the despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurde, ndlr) by banning a party, it has reported to the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closing of the parties.
This is not a solution, said Taner Yildiz Minister of Energy.
This decision is a total torpedoes of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a response from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows may fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very strict winter.
But the manager of the road sanding and sanding service (ESF) states that it is not for the public to stumble.
It's just that agents can test vehicle technology and learn to control them.
And according to meteorologists, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and vergla.
The EFF follows a very well-designed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as he snowed over the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures went down below zero, large sand vehicles passed through 20 main routes (known as A) .
This includes the streets, the main arteries, such as the New Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
These include firefighting access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas, and roads such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of the road must be saluted with a road foundation that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning "so that roads can be cleared when daily migration is started".
There or it gets harder, it's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, we are told by the manager of the road sanding and sanding service "because no motorist is willing to let the cars pass".
Then, if it doesn't snow anymore, we take care of access roads and desert roads - like Rat-Beil-Straße.
The secondary roads and the side streets are finally coming.
Mr Brauburger well knows that there are still some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES Pedestrian Team is on its way to prioritize hazardous areas and passes.
With regard to cyclable tracks, the services of the EFF cannot normally deal with them.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22h and 430h.
As the verglas form very quickly on these surfaces, the lubricating vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It is also possible for the police to use this special service if necessary.
The Dinosaurs' Berceau
The Tawa hallae was similar to other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped would measure about 2 meters long for 1.50 m high, its later members were powerful, its extended skull was equipped with tarnished and curved teeth, its short arms ended up with fennel grips and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, like the Sertling Nesbitt report from the University of Texas in Austin and its colleagues in the Thursday Science magazine, Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which made it part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, the Pangée and was in the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa brightens the evolution of the first dinosaurs on a new day.
In fact, he tells us about the relationships of parenthood, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt conducted digs with other paleontologists, on the Gohst Ranch site north of New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Natural History Museum and a member of the dig team reported that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The surveys have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers have baptized him in the name of Tawa according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
All paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but he states that it allows to confirm certain theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, how long Saurines have divided themselves into three major evolution groups: the theropodes (carnivores) which include the tyronosaur and the cyclociraptor that appear later and which descend the birds, the sauropods, the long tail quadrupeds, and those that are related to them and the herbivores of Ornithichian species such as the triretaops and the stegosaur.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theorists.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found indications that Tawa hallae had small airbags in its bones at the level of the skull, as well as birds that are the descendants of the theropodes.
These small air pockets make it easier to breathe birds than mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrates were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theorists who have small air bags in their bones.
Since the apparent line of the huge sauropods also had airbags and a light bone, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive migration waves to North America.
As the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the saurines had appeared there.
As a result, the three major evolution lines have been divided and divided from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all the emerging lands that formed the Pangée supercontinent.
This appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other theorists who are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advance researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of the Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three migration waves to North America.
There have been some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silage, which lived in the present Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while practically none of them are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era while they came from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many others.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread across the planet, thereby promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There could be a massive extinction at which dinosaurs were randomly survived while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or then, dinosaurs were better adapted and could eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favourable meteorite was the expansion of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and had been growing in the shade since then: it was mammals.
Vienna solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the casino police at J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemn the police intervention claimed by the University Steering Committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers after scratching walls and works of art were barboulled with graffiti.
Five students were injured during evacuation.
Signatories believe that the degradation did not justify "such a violent intervention on the part of the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable achievement" to freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "delegate and criminalize protest" and tries to make the reasons for mobilization forget.
The Board of Directors of the University has thus withdrawn from discussions that would, however, be essential.
Course officers require that criminal prosecutions be suspended immediately.
The majority of the population did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
Young people from the Green Trade Union of the Service Sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity among students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary for the youth of the Verdi union.
With regard to the Minister of Science of the Hesse Country Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she also took the initiative of the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, she told the regional Parliament of Wiesbaden on Thursday at the current hour television show.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said MP Peter Beuth of the Regional Parliament.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Gauche (left) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few walls painted to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche (Linke) party.
Instead of reflecting on the arguments and claims of students, they are being evacuated.
The Gauche Party has tabled a motion which is the Minister of the Interior to report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time it was the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zeenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a search place for the secret weapon, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nanoelectronic production and research sites are installed.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the place of Francofort sciences – with university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were mutual and Wednesday meetings of the representatives of Zeenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of Close Cooperation".
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Principal Anatoly Slimov of Zeenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zeenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want contracts in Germany.
Zeenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnical Engineering, the major companies Lemonics and Rossijskaja-Electronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zeenograd (literal translation "Green City") draws its name from the wooded hills whose research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The size of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For its participants it is nothing less than the "new heart of Europe".
If you want to. S21, it is much more than a train station's leak, more than a colossal construction project that will sink the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a desperate chaos of buildings for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the 1980s.
The main line stations, along with roads that ended up in the city, had the reputation of being the remnants of the 19th century transport technique that made a brake Saturday of modern rail traffic because it took a long time to move the locomotives from the back to the front.
Come, stop short, go – that's what you have to do.
That's why the main line stations have to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Rail Highway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from where the slogan "the heart of Europe" is.
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost, to get the station into the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the main line stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with autorails and car-pilot at both ends.
However, the implementation of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route from the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and community policies have led to this.
The railways company is part of the company because it is the taxpayer who makes the risks of the biggest project infrastructure of the federal republic and not the public enterprise.
From a urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
There is a urban space that – if you believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is bad.
The Passage Station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of persons to which they were assigned - and are typical of the 1980s - huge growth.
At that time there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening goods traffic, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new pattern, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious about other railway projects indirectly.
For example, six billion euros will be absorbed in the Souba project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of connection and engagement in the network.
The Department of Transport lists 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 km.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be really urgent to support deep down here on the champ.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake Sabbath.
The Rhine Valley route is about to become the hub of the narrowing of international goods traffic, which is at the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgement of the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the country raised the possibility to appeal to the judgement of the Hesse Administrative Tribunal on the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had entrusted experts with legal review of the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal and is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the project to construct the northwest landing track at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The permit to land for 17 aircraft between 23 and 5 p.m. in the morning, as the Government of the country plans, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night-to-night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make a provision in breach of the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this time-limit and tries to pressure the government's representative to ensure that the opposition is available to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and to ban night flights. Otherwise, this will be considered as a total failure to a given word.
It's extremely difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said Green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the Electoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch rejects Schäfer-Gümbel's allegations that the country's government is still trying to authorize night flights using "advocacy and rubble".
It takes time to carry out a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition's statements on the prohibition of night flights by its group is completely misleading.
U.S. banks repay the aid granted
The large US banks, very affected by the crisis, are disbanding their ties with the State.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid $45 billion in the Treasury (more than €30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp Rescue Plan.
The U.S. TV chain CNBC reported in a report Citigroup also planned to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to remove the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of the bonuses awarded to the managers and the higher cost regulation.
The Bank of Americaa launched an increase in capital by selling securities to investors who reported $19 billion in cash.
The rest of the sum comes from bank funds that are well filled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America, had to express his gratitude to the US taxpayers: the capital injection has helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capacity by purchasing Merrill Lynch's investment bank to the strongest of the financial storm.
The Citigroup also plans to seek money on financial markets in order to free itself from State protection.
The U.S. bank could thus launch an increase of $20 billion on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain citing banking environments.
Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated Selection
Finally, everything happened even faster than planned.
Only two weeks after the decommissioning of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the German ZDF Management Board, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night for the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin-based ZDF edition, was the great favor.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness not to harm the ZDF officer Markus Schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend the Nikolaus Brender contract for five years, but it had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had declared themselves in favour of the resumption of Brender and 7 others had voted against.
The CDU, which is a majority member of the Board of Directors, had already heard several weeks before the vote, did not wish to resume Brender's office.
It was Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of Hesse, who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the highly estimated editor-in-chief contract by calling for the reduction in ZDF information emissions from Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, fusing the growing political influence exercised on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 experts in public law who had become involved in the debate and who felt that the way in which Koch acted was anti-constitutional.
But it wouldn't have been useful.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and Roman (Spanish) languages.
He then worked at the Southwestfunk (Rhenania-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national newspaper).
In 1983 he became an editor in the ZDF first of all at the newspaper newspaper "today-journal" (today's journal).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor-in-chief at the time; then, corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998, he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bi-monthly information issue presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the ZDF's foreign policy service and then head of the Berlin-based drafting.
After Brender's dissatisfaction, while he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, Rhenania-Palatinate Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the lieutenant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a party political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political personalities from ZDF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of Brender, had successfully handled the Board of Directors by criticising the commission with vehemence in its decision to limoger Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect it without suspecting a political partisan.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is left-wing liberal.
Large cleaning in university studies
Partly success for students: after a year of education strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of Länder decided to be more reconciled: at a meeting between Ministers and delegates from the Conference of Directors, an agreement was reached that the working conditions of Bachelor and Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to ease the weight of the examinations: a single examination must allow the selected study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "real and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also undertook to organise more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master's branches.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one country to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the university directors have consistently spoken the word "studiability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be completed by a single examination", can be read in a document of thirty pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, says that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the derailment, which would significantly damage the feasibility of the study.
"Study" should also be the crucial criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if it is not possible to avoid this feeling of suffocation that is sometimes felt in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate fraud.
Students should "have the opportunity and scope necessary to allow and promote the personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "recruited" every 5 years, which means, however, that in 2015 only all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put pressure on the Länder to force them on the agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already been consulted with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhine-Palatinate has so far been the only country to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programmes to strengthen educational guidance offices as well as review offices and international relations services
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of 10 million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wishes to propose to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
Thereafter, there will be only one examination to complete its studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, as well as ensuring recognition of notes from other higher education institutions and access to Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studiability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the subject of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticisms were made.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students announced that he would like to see the organization of education policy no longer take place in the future "after closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
Not later than after the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Directors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us" she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduated Bachelor to join a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder provide students with a bachelor's degree today, that there will be enough room for studies in Master and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore employ more trainees.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematicizes the experiences of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a German and English professor in Bucharest and then a collection director in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt on Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry from Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the house of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of mention of him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror deforming of your security files".
Apparently destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Security Policy.
Söllner received the German language prize in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The enrolment tests had begun in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "so someone who has not been able to withstand the intimidation of Security".
Poet Werner Söllner is informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost at the same time with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary illiteracy with the mechanisms of the dictatorship's power, the literary scene is torn apart and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abysses and basses of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from the present knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own security file, IM Walter played a role, provided the literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favour.
"He had been able to remove it from all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, but the lack of an old dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is not in fact so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and sometimes guess what real names recently hidden the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Instead of Germany where, in the meantime, the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Security files is still very confused.
Systematic lighting has been continuously counter-balanced and delayed in recent years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Security (CSAS) but the return of the files has since been trained.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very large is confirmed by the interview of a former Head of the Security of Temesvar who, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a third disparaging way with regard to the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and eventually she was interrogated only once.
The unfamiliarity of power was thought to be able to express itself here, without any genes, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many of the inevitable issues are associated with the Söllner case as this occurs so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been robbed? The weighted reaction of the audiences, to the grandfather of Söllner, lets hope that the follow-up of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst to know than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the origin of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived, shot at four pins coming all right from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports item manufacturer had posted his goods when the new VFB Christian Gross coach went up to less than a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose skull would attract attention, was allowed to drive to the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, our 50-year-old would have been able to take the thief himself – he had not been drinking alcohol and he was not happy.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because now it was going to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth of the final", that is, in the league of the champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back."
The "great work" awaits us on Sunday.
There it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three expeditional goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lot of drawings
The eighth final of the Champions League (match gor 16/17. + 23/24 February/match return 9.10. + 16/17 March) will be released on 18 December in Nyon.
Thus, the joy of entering into the dominant role of the successor of Babel was moderate.
And the joy was not limited only to the one who had given the chance, who had transmitted to the dissatisfied Stuttgart professionals, an unmistakable motivation and the pleasure to play.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "soul dome" – Gross – the recipe of success that sounded so well that no longer had any effect with the nurse Babbel.
He started a certain magic, with Jens Lehmann - a partisan of Babbel - "in the foot when there is a new impulse there are sometimes things that we would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced to the best player thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the " phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new boss: "It's someone who passes into action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the head yet, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Like Gross, players and managers are well prepared to reassess the victory against a totally overrun and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow four days later a bad wake up in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the targets of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't gone through the difficult head yet.
That Heldt did not have the heart to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after his first victory at home for three months, was due to the weekend events that a TV interview of the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann had just rebounded before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt would oppose, in response to Lehmann's aberration.
He accused the management of style weakness and said that she had decided to change as a trainer under the pressure of pubertyist fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the matches had been removed from him.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by a pure selfishness” and Heldt announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends with these two four-year-olds.
In any case, they agreed for everything else, namely that without the group's prior work by the replacement coach, strong sports and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "to a great extent in success" returned Heldt and Lehmann in a chorus – and even the man in the plastic bag acquired.
World Heavyweight Championship
Warm combat in Berne: Kevin Johnson provoked the challenger on a continuous basis, verbally and collectively, the champion of the Vitali Klitschko world.
But after 12 difficult rounds, Ukraine defends its position as heavyweight champion of the world according to the WBC Federation version.
With the unanimity of the judges, it was necessary to make the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains its title as the heavyweight champion of the world.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the points at the unminority of judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has been defending his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
In the past, Ukraine had won the World Cup of the WBO and WBC Federations twice.
Unfortunately, he failed the KO so expected.
Klitschko, a 39-time winner in 41 professional fights, has twice his defect due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson has to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2,02 meters, on its left.
Johnson, 11 centimeters younger than the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the defeat of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from putting into practice his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive for a challenger, has mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and in gestures his blows only rarely caught the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having exceeded the distance of the 12 rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko the "Zombie Vilein" who "is not really capable".
During Friday's weight, the champion couldn't stop himself from provoking Johnson by dropping his nose sunglasses "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko re-employed during his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a pause of almost four years, he had fought at that time Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously left without fighting.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Areola of the United States.
"I just took a hit in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Vladimir is the champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it's British David Haye who, having demolished the great Nikolai Walujow - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was due to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is planning to make this game play now at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence of lying in the case of Kunduz.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (the Left) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After considering the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately dissimulating certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "contradicted" the murder of two tankers last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group Jürgen Trittin on Saturday during the ARD's "Tagesschau" chain of information.
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was completely disregarded by the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, essentially, the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the strike was actually, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two major Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the US air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Kunduz military commander.
The Greens, the SPD and the Gauche prayed on Saturday to Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Verts Renate Künast party are of the opinion that Madame Angela Merkel must clearly state whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan federal government's policy if the chancellery, army and information services have approved this new strategy.
The Government's spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellor did not in any way influence the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, more and more votes were taking place to express doubts about the real reasons for the referral of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Department.
According to SPIEGEL, the information they had sent to Guttenberg regarding the attack of tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have discounted the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
However, the two senior staff members were informed by the Ministry of Defence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeineer Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have asked for clarification of the facts in an e-mail.
So far, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred them to the Federal Parliament's Investigation Committee, which would be the next Wednesday to bring light to the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, every waking one, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is nothing but mental illness, or under the drug effect, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our shadowy rooms, we can easily fall into the most crazy dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who wakes up, experiences the state of dreams, understands and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices only appear in mental patients or under the influence of drugs.
It's our imagination that's in question: it's the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes encourages the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called vision, to the worst of madness.
But even though the trigger and the effect differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second state of the bells, psychosis and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or deliriums when the balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth Attractive Force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and physicians have always thought about the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, deliriums and sensory illusions that make it up".
We're in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon character.
His body is in two dimensions in the colors of the cry.
The earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it plans at the edge of the ceiling.
It feels like a blow.
Behind him are creatures of the devil, allied, grizzling, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They follow him, give him kicks with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over the body.
Tonituring voices, evil voices, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear these voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo channel, in fact a loop and attachs it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around the neck.
He misses it.
The loop is decelerating.
What a lesson this is for you, they scream in a chorus to pull his tampan. "Go to a clinic and take care of yourself!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first soon 20 years.
It was launched by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniaco-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness and has been married for three years.
During my psychosis, I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
One percent of the population suffers at least once in their lives from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the individuals concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the external world, they are in a state of hyperexcitation, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomony, related madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare anymore.
The person concerned can no longer make the distinction between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the doors to a host of ideas and ghosts from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum) .
Schizophrenia is at the heart of the situation, all of which has a focus on it.
At the same time it is in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
They generally do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in his life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
Delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of life takes place in a real framework.
Why does our brain make this kind of cockroaches, it's always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have infrequent brain damage.
The brain’s neuronal maturation is supposed to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a mother’s viral infection during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way the neurological system anomaly occurs and in addition to the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, though there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain is warm.
What's crazy is, we're told by Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and illustrative images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are well part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis, but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are usually inhibited.
They form when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently refrigerated; when our brain is warm but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of incentives, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental conditions.
In recent studies, at least one third of the participants acknowledge that they have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K., 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania before and goes to high school.
A young girl just making it normal to say the truth.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, it is possible for a young boy, thin, long-haired, to speak to him.
When she answers her friends, they look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this young shy girl is a lunar dream, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain.
She wakes up, listens and sees this boy as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bank.
She may even perceive her presence at the moment.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young person nice.
Do I go crazy?, if she asks you sometimes.
But she well knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally frowning.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while it is invisible to others and the teacher is obviously explaining equations in the table.
At night the apparitions are generally frowning.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that arrives too rarely and very late, she often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dreaming already, if the images she sees, the grinning faces or the young girl with blood-staining cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she yells at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd take it for a joke.
In autumn 2009. Sarah K. today is 20 years old.
She had her bag last year and she lives with her friend.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Since she got into Internet contact with psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is that he has hallucinations at the end of a certain time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, making sure there's an animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was old to think, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience", according to Kasten "a place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to treat hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dreaming and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our world too focused on consciousness there is a quick tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called oniroide, a particular form of change in the consciousness awakened by the dream.
Onyroidal veins are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that it can't distinguish from the dream even when it's awake.
The condition of the uniroide consciousness is manifested during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy who experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is separated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in imagination.
This is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation, a capacity of organization that has been given to us, to us men, not to be obscured in the sense of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memory.
The Zurich historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his uniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a soul-saving action.
He is 49 years old, when his consciousness of a journey several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain in reanimation.
Claussen dives into a world that he has created of all parts, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself in an old man tall in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his hair watching over his health.
He lives in the middle of age among the nobles who manufacture blood-based drugs.
He is taken away by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mob.
It is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these internal journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, does it describe what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, memories of mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
They can even be said to be much more distinct and intense than real life.
The intensity of this life breaks the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, onyroid deliriums, psychosis, hallucinations and psychological experiences show us how fragile our internal representations of the external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows may fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will follow the house of editions.
Callen's appointment to the Burda PDG post is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he said in the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, editor Hubert Burda sees his society between the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to integrate society," said Hubert Burda, 69, at Spiegel.
All the details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then be asked.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of doing so.
It is not possible to impose its children on 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with them.
This would demolish children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he would retire from the position of President-Director-General as of January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
He then took over the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus, for the first time, it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children were 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Callen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% between the hands of the family.
Ruins have always taken place in families that have been trained by a capital bulimia, which have made huge unfortunate speculations, thinking that they could get even higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself in the country's preceptive role as Springer and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues such as Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full Beauty
Everything you can wish, in terms of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is what El Corte Inglés has set, which has just been inaugurated in Callao's commercial center (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to care and attention to the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious teachings such as Hedonai, laser epigraphy specialist, Spaxion, with its rooms for relaxation and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or the Occitan and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food radius, especially a tea room, which offers more than 130 different varieties.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax thanks to a session of jacuzzi, while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 distributed into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative care of your face, body and hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The sports room also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide customers' steps, offering them full personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to do our exercise program properly.
Her director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And if, after working our body, we want to go through the coffee shop, the teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer hair repair, luminosity or nutrition rituals, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 22 a.m.
Miscellaneous Derivatives
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party dress.
The form of decoupling, very important to stress the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated decouple. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with electric car
The Endesa electric company, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Hall, has created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the Installation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will establish mobility arrangements, by taking action, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities ”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities selected by the government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The power company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is involved in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in European-wide standardisation groups and has a set of complementary projects, such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT GREENDE.
Zapatero discusses "a peaceful future" for the engine sector
The President of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, spoke "a future of calm" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the car sector.
"Without a Car Sector Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a abandonment landscape, closing some of our main production sites," said the Government President.
"Thanks to this plan and to the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is included in the Full Plan for the Automotive Sector (IPA), has dedicated €800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized more than €3,000 million in investment.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed government support measures for demand, in line with Plan 2000E, in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and has contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which have progressed by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of car collection
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Car Collection Hall, a meeting space for the professionals and fans of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and car collection, but you will also find ClassicAuto Madrid articles of all kinds related to the engine world.
For example, in pavilion exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, thumbnails, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make collectors happy and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Cásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, or Cochera Cásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this hall will also include parallel activities: assemblies, sporting exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Ability tests with cars and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit built outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, baptised i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 2.0 engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it appears that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is particularly pleasant to him.
By continuing with the set formed by the control table and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as live colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are opposed to the sovereignty of German products, and especially to the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to go beyond.
By continuing with the room, this compact Japanese car has more than enough capacity to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
A large box of regular forms is added to all of this.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horse engine and with manual change of the six-speed engine.
This engine is truly happy. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
In fact, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with fuel engine, both for its great comfort of speed and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, otherwise the one that presents the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the road change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the large screen on board computer, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes, among other elements of the bi-xenon adaptable headlamps and an audio BOSE system with a disk charger.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometres per year will be able to choose for the i-Stop version associated only with the 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, Sport.
In contrast to this significant amount, Mazda3 will offer us a great amount of satisfaction every day.
“First” luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have us more than ever bloated, models as elegant as sexy for Nina's exit. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch its e-mail, without offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attached parts or browsing the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of glory in the United States when the Time magazine called him one of the year's products.
In fact, it is more difficult to see him in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, which is less than half what it costs, for example, the date subscription of the iPhone.
In view of its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free living data service, for six times as expensive as Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as his American grandfather, but it's a surprise.
The monthly subscription price, around 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when you cross a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a phone connection) to be able to consult your mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and this has long been the way it should work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have made a physical thesis to understand them and to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates throughout Europe have had a hardly noticeable effect.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like FonPeek (it's always curious that it's called Fon while it doesn't have Wifi) offers this type of tariff, means that operators start to think differently and study various proposals allowing them to make their data network cost-effective.
Kindle is another good example, including downloading books and other Internet research.
No subscription and no gallery.
It is a connected device and it is paid at its purchase, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a life-access option like Peek already offers it in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm watching my mail on my phone, thank you.
I wish it simply because I think it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
The yellow is, of course, the preferred color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's office at the U.S. presidency with a coat and a coat of that colour, she chose the same to accompany her at the second moment, no doubt the most important thing in her life: her release to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow shot to the green with bright reflections, both times, the dress consisted of three parts: the dress, the garment and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or necklace.
As soon as he first saw it, it would seem that the first lady in the United States followed the silhouette of the Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same tenets.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick tooth, instead, it would bring a printed velvet to Oslo.
Accessories are also different: green-to-white shoes for the first time, and a similar, but gold model this time.
She also changed the hairdresser: the hair is now detected while she was wearing them the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity
Work discrimination has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Fecondity and professional career of women in Spain" carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 does not leave any doubt: 75% of the working mothers have seen their limited professional career due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences between the beginning of life and the number of children, whether or not women work and the type of employment employed.
Those who do not have activity outside the house, work part-time or have little stable work, get married sooner, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women who have stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are able to re-enter marriage and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age have their first child, on average, 3.7 years of age after being installed in a couple. This figure goes to 4.1 for those working in the public sector. "This data shows that women with stable employment have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to withdraw the union and the arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised has a wide influence on maternity, but less on the date of the beginning of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that increases the gap between the age of women's marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education is, the more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who conducted elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have conducted elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have had middle-level or higher-level studies reverse this program and give priority to getting a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several brand products, immersing the universal currency "Because I love it".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actors in the international scene, thus joins other celebrities at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the last to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the brand of cosmetics also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangelical Fellow in Lost).
Prices of British Mode
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and engineers, both yesterday and today, met for the annual return of their prices, which took place in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
The former Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, choose the best mannequin of the year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty "radiographies" of writers who have spent his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and perceived genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of the invented character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent doesn't save the bad guys or the lights.
Delightful, this book is also an exciting invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here for a few moments.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I have found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, even the one I felt without naming it: pleasure against the funstery destiny, moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotentness and ignorance, with an inflammable poetic humor, denouncing sense, like the blade of the knife that failed to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in the flesh of which he mingled the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven by the way of loss."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre summits of the universal literature, which must be engraved on the north side, on which the best climbers are still and still taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange guy.
He himself sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black and crocodile.
These two dreams were of great size."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collects the demented cry from a bridge by this Munch character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did it in the escape of himself and by invoking the posteriority with a violent speech to the astics."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed, "God bless you, I beg you to make me stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave they were engraved towards Spencer: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after life, tired of death ravit."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband usually agreed that she would tell her that Edward VII would beat her among the Azals or that the birds would sing in Greek.
We have never seen such a patient and loving man of a nervousness whose literary talent surpassed madness."
Sur Pío Baroja : «What did Martín-Saintos do if there is no attempt to dissimulate Joyce at Baroja ?
What's Benet trying to do if it's not to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did this man do if it is not to aspire to the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?"
A Lagoon of Attack
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, walked into our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a blood-meal, saved from the SPA and weighed not more than six kilos, and without a word, they struck him two blows of feet that left the dog severely injured.
Our anger is immense because we don't see what it is like to attack a little animal without defense for free, which was also left behind.
In addition to this, the anger of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she injured these individuals, became afraid of her physical integrity, since an animal that attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person who is weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday as well as another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have heard complaints from the district commissioner, even if we believe that this is useful for a great deal and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the killers were Spanish.
Anger has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to young people so they find it fun to abuse for free a defenseless animal that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people has been.
Michelin and Fesvial, set for the port of the helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of helmet, mainly among the younger motorcyclists, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet's port, since it is the only protection element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign included its commitment to road safety, which "go beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributed to this goal by other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to encourage the port of the helmet in two wheels, under the currency "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of two-wheel tyres, one of its main objectives is to develop ever more secure products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12,6 per cent compared to 2008, and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers, that of the concessionaires.
However, the good news should be financed, since the comparison reference, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebundling of the previous month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles (drives from tourism cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light-duty trucks) 95 853 were sold.
The large clouds that affect most of their demand have not been so dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the cases by means of external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions imposed by the limitation of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation should be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E was limited.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks of themselves.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we again recalled the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The concessionaires' association provides for a year similar to the year 2010 that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this has happened with the ABS brakes anti-lock system and as this will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory part of European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered light commercial cars and vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of shortage has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's objective is to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its way of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of emergency detected by the system through the driver's kick.
But the latter doesn't always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident could not rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in return, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided every year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these intelligent braking systems of emergency: it is estimated that a disaster of four with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, by means of a radar or a camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver from acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps him by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors rebounds until January the plan for Opel
While Opel de Figueruelas (Saragosse) factory workers were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would take more time to complete the Opel relief plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this could imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish government has put pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM agrees to be in touch with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the applicant of the Dutch manufacturer of Skype sports cars, supported by the Russian group Converg, is of importance.
In the event that there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
In the flight of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last precious jewelry, Porsche engineers left Boxster S and managed to start from nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to pass, first of all, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a hand-held roof, allowing the reduction of 21 kilos, the use of aluminium doors such as those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, the removal of the air conditioner, 13 kilos, the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winners, the mounting of sports bags, another 12 kilos, and with light 19 inches tires, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the audio CDR-30 system, making six more kilograms and replacing the wrists with the wrists in the fabric, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double-braking PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the roads of the secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly crooked turns.
His conduct can only be described as reprehensible.
Weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with a lead.
On the contrary, it has been a long time since we had not tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, guarantees so much safety in the turns, including at high speed.
It's a little athlete, capable of heating up his muscle little speed during the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and recharge his motor...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is, the car will do what our hands tell on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Vulnerable engine sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the option "sport" or through a system that changes the engine noise, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether by arrest or by recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The cover of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite low, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
Electronic assistants barely perform presence on the entire route, while on certain turns we found from the verglas to the morning and from the graveyards, later in the morning.
In the end, an ultralight car, the most fun to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70 831.
"Back Girl"
Karl Lagerfeld's intimate friend, Coco Cocoon's icon and occasional starlight of the house shows, the singer shows his bad girl's face with as much continuance as his Chanel bags.
More than a Bad Girl or an It Girl, it's a Bag Girl.
Basconia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a 91-82 triumph during its visit to the hard terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the Dusko Ivanovic team. It is thus in the head of its group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show, which, with eight baskets to three points was the best of its team (29 evaluations).
Vitoria's team was able to complete Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov's major absences with a large amount of collective engagement and work, even though it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill since the perimeter, with 16 baskets at three marked points, largely determined the final victory.
The match began quickly for the blue and red, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked since the perimeter made it appear that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with warm hands.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 end of the first quarter.
The second quarter-time was the same tone, but the Alava team chose the interior game of Barak and the work of Eliahu, which was received by applause and applause back to its former home, to increase their benefit at break (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to be noticed as the best player of his team, with 13 marked points, although Splitter's "less than six" rating had already made it appear that this night was not going to be Brazil's best.
But in this game, even though they were on the right track for the break, nothing was played, far away, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that it was not so easy to win in their field, and thanks to "the hand of Elijah", they were able to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the benefit of the yellow on the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from being dead, needed to launch some action that was capable of taking the air, and it was at this time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged, which, with three three consecutive rounds and the help of English and Ribas, sent the counter to a comforting score (54-67), and that the premises were able to accentuate at the end of the third quarter time (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything at all during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) reported that they were not going to let anyone take what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not re-sign and tried to support her from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for errors, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defend well, and although the Israelis had approached during the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped to Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Wounds prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost its head in Greece in the face of the Olympiacos and gave it the head of Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
Malaga's team was not excavated by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship flag or by the size of the rival, no doubt one of Europe's most powerful and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter time, allowed to make the Andalusians dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets at three consecutive points, two of the manager Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who blew up the local team 12-18 at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20 at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a beginning of baggarre, between the American minors Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for the damage of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The Lithuanian internal players Linas Kleizas, with their three-point carts, increased the advantage 44-32 at the nineteenth minute.
A Resurrected Impossible
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, which, despite the loss of the 19th, was higher and even equal to the difference in the meeting in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group's head to be cancelled.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit from the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, wounded during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to his organization, three-point cook baskets, and Lewis' support, left little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But victory was almost impossible because the Olympiacos proved implacable when players pressured and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, succeeded in raising the score to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the pay they would earn from their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles ads in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 jobs available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city you want to work.
Since one week of application, the research engine has detected that, generally speaking, the Spanish worker "sufferes badly," explained in a statement by the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovità from its research engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well-paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 gross euros annually and a French, 31,059, while a Spanish man receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34 247 gross annual euros in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid job in Spain is that of the server, with 11,592 net annual euros, followed by the seller, with 14,725 euros, and the worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the last three months are those of the driver, the mid-term job and the social worker.
Brazil sets a date for departure from Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his Tegucigalpa embassy.
The vice-president will have to leave the diplomatic legion no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, who is responsible for the affairs of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugees since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, after his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also quoted the former MP, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline is set: "My position is starting as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29th elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, that same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that he intended to impose on him the actual government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant market note, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising as it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to currencyize debt through direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at close zero levels, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilise.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without questioning their non-conformity liquidity policy, they are beginning to place a little sand in the rubble, as the ECB has done, with their award to one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reverse of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and the differences in corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far away from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt.
There is once again a shift towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the investors' chosen shelters, creating an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a new review of the decline in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to expose moral risk defenders, who once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for global economic policy who had hampered the destructive effects of the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done was to decree a new day of action of grace.
However, the situation in Dubai is similar to a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore its place to power in the emirates and we have already seen the case in Greece.
A government that dissipates a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot to the roses.
Produce it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area to fail to comply with its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and has made its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we face an episode of standardization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excessive positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our deficits in public debt increase to the size of European business obligations, we need not be concerned.
If European disparities were to decrease and our growth continued, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncrasy risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotes. When our predictive indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their models of relaunch and to review their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are back in charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not raise much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the time being "cautious is a mother of safety".
Connected Sectors
The President of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Congress of Members' Subcommission, which discussed Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by that of the President of Natural Gas-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán outlined to the press what he had mentioned in front of the subcommission at eight closes.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and EUR 60,000 million more between that date and 2030, if nuclear power plants are to remain open today.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
However, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue changes, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses both on gas and carbon plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this regard, it considers that more 18 000 MW are needed, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not want to attack the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which is contrary to policies to combat climate warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "points" measures, as the President of Iberdrola described them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Air Lingus maintenance market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground-based airport services, will play the privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms were not disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create the Centre for the Innovation of Smart Infrastructure.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Actiona disputes its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Actiona fights for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The building is a tunnel estimated to be $1,700 million in Australia (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East coast, is such an option to allow Actiona to establish itself in the country as a public-service and motorway concessionaire.
The mayor of the city wants to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project successfully, within a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the payroll.
Pending the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment amounted to $1,700 million in Australia (approximately €1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The baptized Transcity group is led by Actiona, the only Spanish-leaving company, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, established in Italy, is one of the largest European underground workers.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French Construction Group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared among the Australian Leighton (the branch of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which has in turn the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Galois company specialized in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large structures and privatizations, but entering it presents a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS is hardly able to win a place on this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Monetary assets
It has taken action on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier and debalination sector.
Among other things, it has the largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and manages the grouping of companies to raise and manage Adelaide's delineator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to benefit from synergies to enter the infrastructure construction and management markets.
The underground road to pay, promoted by the Infrastructure Office of the city of Brisbane and Ladite Northern Link (north link), is called to link Toowong's western highway to the peripheral road in Kelvin Grove (see map) by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest project to reduce traffic in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this route will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two routes, an electronic pay system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide $500 million (EUR 308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make extensive fruitful Hochtief, which last year mentioned the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company held by ACS will, through its local subsidiary Leighton, equip the infrastructure of the national high-voltage fibre network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to access the Internet quickly and provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has submitted the King George Tower construction project of 27 floors in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet started and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is awarded the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having seen the work of expanding the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the building is scheduled for early 2010, and its completion will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore was awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros a year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been selected from 16 agencies that have submitted themselves to the offer call organized by Renfe, four of which have been finalized, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million in France Telecom to stop competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million in France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on the fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by programs of loyalty to consumers outside the regulatory framework.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still a state firm has been accumulating more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, due to its obstacles to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar crimes in the past and is therefore reciprocated.
A store of applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone branch has followed other operators and has opened a store of Internet applications, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
At first, the Orange App Store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barca since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which placed them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs that have put the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is in the top of the list.
The Manchester United is in the top of the list.
Gaining the UEFA Champions League is not only a source of glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have been well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan Club, currently under title and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is the fifth on the list.
The list is the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams who have also invoiced the most for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more than any other title (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the ranking games (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match in question.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (€800,000) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in eight finals receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in four finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça has drowned 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But, in addition, there are variable payments, to which there are 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important and has four attractive places.
The previous year's champion ranks 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of games played during the current year's edition.
New Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The New Rumasa Group listed yesterday the details of the sale of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for all securities.
Specifically, New Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this report.
Yesterday, Sos's shares ended at EUR 1.85 ; New Rumasa's offer therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos's actual assessment.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company has stated that it has contacted the regulator.
If necessary, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos's capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of his direction.
In an attempt to stay outside of any bids for purchase and go and come judges from his former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes the first woman to occupy a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
In addition, the possibility that over the next few months Sos reveals new diversions of funds cannot be removed.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) reported yesterday to the National Hearing that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's OPA to exclude presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the OPA to exclude presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The monitoring body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with existing standards and that it considered that the contents of the explanatory sheet submitted were "sufficient" as a result of the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer relates to the acquisition of 550 008 shares by Federico Paterina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the social capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He also explained that 5,592 778 million shares were immobilized, and that they could not be transmitted in any way before the end of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
Manually calculate the cost of repairing between €20,000 and €30 000, including the parts and the work hand can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then treating them and offering them to their clients in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audex, of the North American Solar Group, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the field of evaluation tools and sector information development are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's commercial director, the company in Spain has 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years, more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched only during the previous fifteen years.
When a new car leaves the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, as each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be cataloged and their price entered.
In addition, there is a "smart" graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a car.
If this is a model sold massively, work can be prepared within a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If this is a small car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audex has complete information of 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information about the Porsche, but not the Ferraris or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 %.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in some brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There, more than a hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer different products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but according to countries, there are also tools for the management of parts or to calculate the venous or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of the opportunity cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audex does not offer it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to come up with an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the light product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75 for customers who use it at least ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which does thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it comes out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its number of bodies.
AudaGlass focuses on the glass of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open-ended server for the professional sector on the Internet, which allows you to plug on the vehicles declared to be safe.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geo-demographic analyses or know common problems by brand or model.
It is possible, for example, to study how many models of a given brand go to the garage for a bench or how many severe disasters have occurred for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It commercializes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company founded in 1971 in the Einsa Group as a provider of services and solutions for assessment of accidents, accidents or maintenance.
The evaluation GT guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20 per cent per year over the last three years, and it has made a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she undertook her process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
On the other hand, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is achieved in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The global business figure of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed in the $1 000 million stock exchange, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it is next to the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Investigations on the Internet of Accidental Cars
Last October, the Solar Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and damaged special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended to the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an enormous international market.
This valuation and sales service is addressed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cashiers and professional sellers who need to be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1,500 sellers and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number of boxes has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, certain parts that are not trimmed can be used as spare parts.
The collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Garage expenditure in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a dollar in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search the spare part, create a dollar and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who are, to a greater or lesser extent, reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its number of bodies, a real graphical image of the model in question appears and the required piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as the labour price, increases or reductions, and then print the device to return it to the client.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros a year, which may be the subject of a credit.
Currently, the Audex company is working to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will, for example, allow them to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
