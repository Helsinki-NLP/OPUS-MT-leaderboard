Velka Assembly Representatives Concerned That They Will "Look Like Muppets"
Some Assembly Members (AM) have proposed to call them Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was the result of plans to rename the assembly into the Velska Parliament.
Assembly representatives from all political spectrum are concerned that they might become the subject of a coup.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the name was "rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: on the big twp it means stupid, and pwp shit.
The meeting representative from the Waless Party (Vol. Plaid Cymru) said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
Velski conservative said his group was "open" to change the name, but that MWP in speech could quickly be converted to Muppet.
In this context, the word "w" is similar to the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing the law to introduce a change of name, announced: "Of course, the final decision on how the Assembly representatives will be entitled to be on their own."
The law of the Wales government of 2017 gave the Velšek Assembly the authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that have been widely supported to change the name of the assembly in the Velska Parliament.
When it comes to what representatives will be called in the assembly, the Committee has been inclined to call the "members of the Grand Parliament" or MWPs, but MWP has received the largest support during the public consultation.
Assembly representatives suggest alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to a headache for the Assembly President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill of amendment within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of congregation representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the discussion of the law, congregational representatives will have a decisive vote on what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on the country's name change
Voters will vote on Sunday if they want to change the name of their country to "North Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a multi-decade dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long maintained the claim that its name of its northern neighbour represents the surrender of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its process of EU and NATO accession.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on name change, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were silenced as the churches in Harlem fought for survival
"The older people I spoke to said that in the past there could be a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"There's no one else today."
He said the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People are dating today in a different way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood in which people regularly live."
When it comes to churches, however, it is concerned that money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and "before or after it will be found again at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people would live who would not help the rest of the churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people buying apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "so you will come faster the day when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who have moved into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that maintained the worship nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church took over a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson on the lead that led the boycott of merchants on a little 125th street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of black people.
The 1939 fire was hard to damage the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned its reconstruction, they ordered a series of bells, the so - called carillon.
Blessed David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin, proudly called carillon "the bells of poor people".
The expert who played at the carillon in July used the second title: "cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing at the largest carillon in the Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't change him.
What is being played in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story of architects and construction workers, some of whom were brought by lay leaders of the church, and others by the episcopal children.
Sacristy, the governing body of the church, composed of the ages, wrote to the children in July about the concern that the children would "try to transfer expenses" to the Sacris, although the Sacris was not involved in the engagement of architects and construction workers who sent the child.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the baby.
Sea dog injured 13-year-olds during diving for lobsters in California
According to an official announcement, a sea dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while digging for a lobster in California on the day of the opening of the hunting season for lobsters.
Something happened before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said about the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he dived with friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then led the group to the attack site to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was an excitement about the caught lobster, but then he realized he was shouting "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said when he approached the boy, he noticed that his whole key bone was broken.
"I made sure everyone gets out of the water: "There's a sea dog in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy is transferred by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of sea dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain of the rescue team Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark was seen in that area a few weeks earlier, but it was established that it was not a dangerous species of the shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from the beach Ponto in Casablanca to the Swami in Ecinitas to conduct an investigation and safety of the bath.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sea dogs in that area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans for entry to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s becomes a competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic desks in the style of shop houses and by hiring specialised sellers.
In the context of the large market entry of UK beauty worth GBP 2.8 billion, which continues to grow compared to the fall in sales on the home market, larger cosmetic desks will be tested in 11 trades across the country and expanded to additional trades next year if successful.
Investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to use the space on the shelves that was once intended for televisions, microwave ovens and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the offer of cosmetic products for 3000 products, including the first time and brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And existing assortment companies L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to shops such as Boots.
The supermarket will once again start its assortment of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger buyers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume dealer will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first one opened last week in Croydon in South London and the other one opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net purchase and return to daily purchase of small amounts of food in local food stores means that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Director General Sainsbury’s said he would fly out more and more like a slave house while this supermarket chain is trying to resist favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidl offering a greater number of services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced outlets of Argos into hundreds of shops, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because he bought both chains two years ago, thereby encouraging the sale of food and making the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to update its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended up fighting about sharing the income from the drugstore in its supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury’s three years ago for GBP 125 million sold its pharmaceutical business in 281 Celesiu, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds claims to play a part in the plan by placing a range of luxury skin care products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s said: “We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to give our users a more comfortable environment.
We've also invested in the special training of a colleague who'll be at the hands of the buyers and give them advice.
Our assortment of trademarks is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations means that we are now an attractive destination for the purchase of cosmetic products, which will lead to changes in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "fighting" after Holly Willoughby gave up a $11 million contract
The Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones show star left to "cook out of anger" after TV director Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds with his brand to focus on his new contracts with the brand Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and fashion accessories, Truly.
Their brand is compared to the Goop Gwynet Paltrow brand.
The director of this morning's show (37) on Instagram announced he's leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones show star to cook out of anger by retreating from a profitable joint business at the last moment to focus on his own new great deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "angrily" when a gold girl on television during a tense meeting Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts amounted to up to 1.5 million pounds means that there is no longer time to devote to their brand of household clothing and fashion supplements Truly.
This work was compared to Goop Gwynet Paltrow's brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It should be a long-term investment in the future that would ensure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved in the job.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to the whole line.
In the headquarters of Marlow's warehouse is a lot of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of this morning's show leader, one of Britain's most paid-up stars, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large amounts of money invested in products in the range of pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing and the possible additional delay in the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were ten years close friends with Jones and his husband, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones (52) joined them as president of the board in March.
Couples spend vacations together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of ITV's I'm a celebrity.
Source near Jones said last night, "We do not want to comment on his business activities."
Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he was going to get in the papers because of comments that some might consider "indecent presidents" and because he had such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give so many concessions?"
He said Trump, echoing the voice of the news leader.
"I didn't give any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denoclearization have been closed.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not notice a "responsible reaction" of the United States to the disarmament activities of North Korea.
Instead, he noted that the United States has still not abolished sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic position in his speech at the meeting.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were threatened by a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results – the interruption of the missile pilots, help in the release of hostages and the return of the rest of the American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act as president, but instead of this crowded arena waiting for 10,000 people, we'd have about 200 people there," Trump said, showing a crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were said to be unnecessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lomboka's population has been displaced, there has been no declared national disaster, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international assistance, so it is a bit problematic," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pala, it is not yet certain that the foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palau to see whether international agencies will be allowed to engage in aid efforts.
In view of the constant ground degradation in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared to bear the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in the case of tsunamis have been built in Acehu, it is not something that is common on other parts of the coast line.
The absence of siren for warnings on tsunamis in Palu, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And for the best time, traveling between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship of the hospital that was located in Lombok to deal with the victims of the earthquake on the road is in Pala, but it takes at least three days to reach the scene of a new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's decayed structure was the basis for President Yoko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yoko is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and new elections are taking place next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from other sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fight on the streets of swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Look: player Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hit match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat on Saturday at the Premier League against Chelsea by a 89-minute hit on Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal at 1:0 for Chelsea.
He moved the ball to his left leg before he shot her to the opposite stop.
The ball flew high above the naked towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally escaped the Kepaj Arizabaagaja who jumped towards it and entered the net.
"It was necessary to get to that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante coming and I only once touched the ball. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led by 1:0 in the mid-term after the hit of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The blue attacker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic during that game before he turned around in half the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic performed a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passing ball that Hazard brought to the naked.
Hazard circled around the defense and hit the ball with his left leg in a net on the opposite stop next to the hill of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club competition against Naples in the League of Champions at 3:00 a.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton to the UEFA European League at 3:00 a.m. in London on Thursday.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, the state disaster office reported on Sunday morning.
At the press conference, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said that a large number of people were reported to be trapped in the ruins of the building after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that felt on Friday and caused waves of height up to 6 meters.
The city of Pala, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) for suspicion of murder after the woman was killed.
The murder investigation was initiated after a female body was found in Birkenhead this morning in Merseyside.
A 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police called people from that area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like everyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found living in Birkenhead and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived on the scene who thought they knew that woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation was ongoing, and the police said it was during and the procedure for notifying the nearest family victim.
The taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one could enter the building or get out of it.
He lost his word when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours until they can return to their homes.
The police officer allegedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman showed up at the crime scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 14:00, there were two police vans in the fenced area, and another one was parked right outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and controlled the apartment block.
Of all those who have any information, it is requested that they send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously address Crimestoppers on number 0800 555 111, calling to record 247 from 30 September.
Kip Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument that took place in the middle of the debate on "historic overture"
His prosecution would be a poetic justice for the almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts that his fanatic Puritan followers performed.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt to "stupidly" and "tried to break history".
John Goldsmit, president of Cromwell’s company, said: “In the debate that is currently taking place in connection with the removal of the statues, it was imperative that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace become the subject of the debate.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or even spent.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his great-grandfather Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful revitalization of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the way of thinking of the 19th century and of the history of a person that many still consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many to be, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, more than today, a defender of parliament from outside pressure, of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Is this a fully credible view of the subject of the historical debate that continues?
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the post-development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of Guardians are still worthy of honor and recognition."
A pig's killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in southwest China.
A man mentioned only by the name of "Yuan" was found dead of a cut artery and covered with blood near the shop in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, published the South China Morning List on Sunday.
The pig breeder was preparing to immunize pigs in the pighouse on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He allegedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of his neighbor's pig was open.
He said there was a big pig man in the stable with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, the forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighed 250 pounds [250 kg] and bitten the breeder to death.
Guyang's evening news says the cousin named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and desecrated."
The security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager said to the Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent someone else from attacking while the police are collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market management are allegedly negotiating a fee for his death.
Although this rarely happens, the attacks of pigs on humans have already been noted.
In 2016, the pig attacked her wife and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a hundred pounds [300 kg] of pigs had landed a big farmer with a tractor until his wife had taken the animal.
After pigs ate farmers in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They're just played.
They're grizzling, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The remains of the rose hurricane bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Ross is weak as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring rains in the area of North Mexico and the southwest of the United States over the next few days.
At 05:00 east time, Rosa smoked at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, a low-pressure area is created and moved to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will start pushing a deep layer of tropical moisture in the north-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity in the interaction with the approaching low-pressure area will cause the emergence of strong dams in much of the southwest.
In the local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous storms, mud bubbles and possible cliffs in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause the formation of a drop of about 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in the parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Boiling floods with rapid deterioration due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain are possible.
There is no advice for walking in the desert due to the danger of tropical falls.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms would bring local storm winds and dusty gusts.
Approaching low-pressure areas will bring local rains on the southern coast of California.
A drop in volume of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause less mud bubbles and skeletal roads.
It'll be the first drop in the wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday late at night and on Monday early in the morning before the end of the day on Monday and on Tuesday cover the wider area.
Heavy rain will spread on Tuesday to the area where the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will be reached and will last all day Wednesday.
In October there are possible major temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central US.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will continue to grow and spread again.
In most Central and Eastern USA, it is expected that the beginning of October will be warmed from 27 degrees from the South Plains to the parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates the large possibility of temperatures above averages in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people were watching six television networks on Thursday, protesting applicants for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political accounting has continued, and the reporters have interrupted the regular programme for the announcement of a conversion at the last minute of Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, that the FBI will conduct a one-week indictment investigation.
Ford told the Senate judicial board that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at the high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burning testimony that he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
Friday's hearing was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in Nielsen's report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate number of viewers for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble measuring the number of people watching content in the offices.
To give you a better welcome, it's about a public who's a number like the one who's watching American football or Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the study strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day hearing, reported from Nielsen.
ABC took another place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of that moderate republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning that protestors shouted at him while he was trying to go to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
For a few minutes, he stood down looking alive at CNN's cameras, and the demonstrators were absconding with their shields.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, "You have the power when so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office had announced an announcement even before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were monitored live when the Judicial Committee was due to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh to vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said he would do it only provided the FBI investigates charges against the candidates during the following week, which required democracy that is in the minority.
Flakea was partially convinced of talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened the FBI's investigation of charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plan to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit in another interview with her on the same issue, saying it was a proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other with customs duties "full nonsense".
Killing Waydea Sims: Police arrested Ditheon Simpson, LSU's death suspect
Police arrested a gun-killing suspect by Wayde Sims, LSU's 20-year-old basketball player.
Diteon Simpson (20) was arrested and detained in custody under the arrest charge for the arrest, Baton Rouge said.
Officials posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and reported they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB, CBS branch.
After Simpson's investigation, the police reported that he confessed to shooting at Wayde and killed him.
A $350,000-dollar guarantee was requested.
On Friday, the municipal moratorium of Eastern Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a head wound through the neck.
The police administration thanks the working group for the fugitives of the state police force Louisiana, the criminalist state police lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for helping in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for implementing the law on "resistance and search for truth".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 183 cm-high wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps in the game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "depressed" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
"That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes on Mexico City
The ashes that cast out the Volcano Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ashes during 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple stabbing and smearing.
Pictures on the social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of the car in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity that is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since the magnitude 7.1 earthquake in 2017 shook central Mexico.
Volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflict of police and Catalan separatists with the annual independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors defending independence clashed with the intervention police and thousands of people joined protests to mark a Catalan polarising polling.
A group of masked separatists, who had been stopped by the intervention police, began to shoot policemen with eggs and dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded by tourists.
The fights broke out later on the day the police used their sticks to calm down the fight.
During a few hours of the group defending independence, "No forgetfulness, No Forgiveness", the unionists called them "Long Living Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries during demonstrations, the local press reported.
The tensions in the region that weighs heavily on independence have not reached a year after the November 1st referendum, which Madrid declared illegal and which the Catalan separatists celebrate.
The majority of voters decided on independence, although the outcome was small, because those who opposed decoupling mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in severe conflicts last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
The independence groups were held on Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who attended separatist demonstrations with his husband, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of luck that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite their achievement of a key, even though they won a tight victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties are hard to hold this year because their most well-known leaders are in a self-intended exile or in detention awaiting trial because of their role in organizing a referendum and a subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is all tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has reported to be running for the European Parliament next year's polls since the end of last year.
"The candidacy for European elections is the best way we can recognise the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after hitting a car in the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after they got hit by a car several times in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday around 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible at some point there's an arrow fired out of a single shot on the car.
Menge's guess brought Livingstone to victory over the Rangers with the result of 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston was to win.
The new club of the Scottish Premiership League, Livingston, surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerard to admit his only second defeat of 18 matches at the head of the club at the Ibrox Stadium.
The Dolly Menge hit proved decisive as Gary Holt's team dealt with Iberian in a second.
Gerard's team is still unbeatable in guests in the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they're playing against Hearts, the leading club in the league behind which eight points remain.
Before that, Rangers within the European League will host the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has been increasing his series of victories to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the chance against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to be running before they got that hit, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but there was a gap on the way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after he had cleaned up to hit Craig Halkett's head against the goal.
Hosts are happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause difficulties to the guests
And that's exactly how a key goal has been achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop a free kick, and Livingston designed an opening, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson together assisted Mengi who hit the middle of the goal.
By that time, the Rangers had most control over the ball, but they faced an unprovable domestic defense, so the goalman Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
That continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the strike.
The legs of Rangers Allan McGregor's Golman stood up to Scott Pittman, and Lithgow led a broad blow from another organised attack on Livingstone.
Long additions failed to cross the naked line of Livingstone, and two one-aesters were not condemned – after Halkett's conflict with the replacement player Glen Middleton and one to play by hand.
"Great" by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC in the Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and the result of Livingstone.
Everyone up to one was great, so they continued to surpass expectations on the way in.
Their style of games and staff barely changed since their return to big clubs, but the great credit goes to Holt and the way he united the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at the head of an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have a breath.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set up a good game under Gerard.
They couldn't get the ball to the end, they just opened a hole in their home team, and that's their kind of call to market for Rangers in the middle of a ladder.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Koelna
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was a lot of smiles under the clear sky when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan Germany – whose aim is to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been divided into views on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
In that city, Turkey's largest population lives outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a large number of presidential supporters who came to see him appeared nearby.
And hundreds of protestors of Erdogan's opponents – including a large number of Kurds – raised their voice by condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him with welcome to the country.
Conflicted demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor to whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others attack as autocrats.
Road crash in Deptford: a biker died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Beswood and Evelyn, on the road with dense traffic in Deptford in the southeast of the city about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man passed on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after the death of another biker after the crash and the driver’s escape from the accident in the Kinders Street, about a mile and a half from the Saturday crash site.
City police have reported that police officers are trying to identify a man and inform his nearest relative.
As a result of the accident, roads are closed and bus traffic is redirected, and motor vehicle drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration reported that six police officers were injured in the riots in the male prison of a locked-up guy.
The riots broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
Special "Tornado" teams have been introduced to reduce the disturbances involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the face were provided with help for minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel are engaged in the management of the incident during Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received help for the damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that everyone responsible will be assigned to the police and that we can spend a long time behind bars."
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after the prisoner attacked him.
And last October, the intervention police were invited to prison to resolve a serious situation in which staff were attacked by ballpointers.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with booms (possible use for dry areas)
The rare thing is that tropical depression hit Arizona, but there is a likelihood that it will happen just at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Ross goes through the rest of the force across the Southwest and brings danger from the stormy floods.
The national hydrometeorological service has already issued warnings about the storms for Monday and Tuesday in the area of West Arizona, through south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get closer to Phoenix late on Monday with the rain and move right across it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix, on its tweet, reported that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought tropical storms or depression in a 200 - mile [320 km] radius of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Centre for Hurricanes provides for 50 to 100 mm droplets, with isolated quantities up to 150 mm on the Mogolon border of Arizona.
In other areas of the South-West Desert, including the Rocket and the Great Pool, there is a probability of a 25 to 50 mm drop, with a possible total isolation of up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of the pink storms, it could come as a rescue because the region was hit by drought.
Although floods are a major danger, some of these dams could be useful because of the current drought in the southwest.
"According to the US drought map, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona was hit by at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com said
The journey of the hurricane first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning Rosa still had a maximum wind speed of 130 km/h and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and was moving north at 20 km/h.
The storm came upon the colder waters of the Pacific, so it weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that the coast of Mexico will be approached by a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or at night.
The rain on parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"The number of total landings expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to the northwest Sonora ranged from 75 to 150 mm, possible maximum 250 mm," weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and in southern Utah late at night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains are very strong rains in the Baja California peninsula, in the north-west of Sonora and in the US desert southwest," the National Centre for hurricanes reported.
It is expected that the rains will cause a life - threatening storm and mud bubbles in the deserts and cliffs in the mountain field.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old stab wound was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton was found injured teenager.
He's been taken to the hospital and he's stable.
Avona and Somerset's police administration reported that 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in the area of Radstock.
Police officers have called for everyone who has a recording of the events.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh suffered evil and anger from the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "tolerated evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanauh testified before Congress and resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault more than ten years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing on the charge she filed.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"Voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an unquestionable career in public service," he said to the grouped consents in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republican leaving for the elections in half the presidential term.
"For five weeks we are divided into one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump said the democratic mission is to "make resistance and obstacles".
The deputy director of the Republican said to the CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people had died, a large number of them had withdrawn the huge waves that had hit the coast when the massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Pala on Friday, when in the evening waves of height up to six meters hit the shore, dragging many of them to death and destroying everything on their way.
Cunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the danger of tsunamis appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately and died," said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Indonesian agency to mitigate the consequences of the GNPB disaster at the Jakarta Journalist Conference.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, fats, houses, he hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunamis crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before he hit the shore.
"Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palau.
Photos from the air published by the disaster agency show a number of buildings and shops destroyed, damaged and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to strike that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) announced in its announcement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to the two-fold power of the atomic bomb dropped at Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical location of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the power of tsunamis.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building and added that 540 people were injured and 29 considered missing.
According to Nugroh's words, the number of victims and damage may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donghal, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
"Communications are completely broken and we don't have information from Dongal."
"More than 300,000 people live in this area," says the report of the Red Cross, adding that staff and volunteers have moved into the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," the announcement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism because of the lack of information that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials claim that the waves came at a time when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top floor of a building panics people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes the water wall fell down on the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquakes and tsunamis have caused the disappearance of electricity that has caused a break in communication around Palu, which has made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the authorities, she started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but food and other necessities are still needed to evacuate.
The city airport is once again open only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed by October.
President Yoko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunamis in Indonesia have taken over 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although World Vision staff from Dongala have successfully arrived in the city of Pala where employees are stationed in the interabulous tents set up in the courtroom of their office, the sights of destruction on the road have passed," Mr. Doseb said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched help wheels in disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been prevented from arriving at the Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply and engagement of staff from other countries can only begin if the site is declared to be a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of the province," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says "Okay, it's a national disaster" we can receive international help, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Pala, friends and families of those still considered missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigated the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was saved from the sewerage.
On Saturday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a Indonesian state paragliding team coach, trained two missing paragliders for Asian games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the prisoners at Roa Roa's hotel, including Peter Mandagija, were his disciples.
"Because of the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, which expanded to the paragliding community, whatsApp sent messages to the Palauan competitions that participated in the festival on the beach.
But his messages are still marked with a gray hook instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took 26.750 U.S. dollars while filling ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole 26,750 U.S. dollars on Friday morning from Brink's employee who filled the ATM in the center of Newport on the Levee, is in a press release from the Newport Police Department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy's announcement says the car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with this, the other man "came to Brinkov's employee's back in the race" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renames to Ye
Raper Kanye West will change the name to Ye.
In a Saturday post on Twitter, which announced the change, he wrote: "Life will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has a nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change comes before his guest at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
The authors of the show said that he replaced the singer Ariana Grande in the show who cancelled for "emotional reasons".
Except for the shortness of his current artist's name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year in a conversation about his album title with the radio director Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us.
It came from Kanye, which means "one," in only Ye – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything within us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one in a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he published that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And once West's associate, JAY-Z, played with versions of his name without a drawing and with a drawing and written in capital letters.
Mexican AMLO promised not to use the army against citizens
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco market that he "will never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military units fired during peaceful demonstrations on that market on 2 October 1968 and killed even 300 people at the time left-wing student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those studying and opening a large number of free public universities.
He said the lack of employment and the lack of education attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount that it invests in research in the field," the investor in the field of artificial intelligence and expert Kai Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
This comment was followed after various parts of the US government announced plans regarding artificial intelligence, although the US in principle lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in the number of AI innovations by 2030.
"Double increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next great discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Two-fold increase in investment could double the chances that next major achievements in the field of artificial intelligence will come to the US," Lee said this week in a conversation with the CNBC.
Lee, whose book is: "AI Velesil: China, Silicon Valley and a new world order" this month, published the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishing house, the head of the company Synovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 80s last century at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the AI system that won the best American game player Othello, and later he was director of Microsoft's Research Department and president of the Chinese branch.
Lee praised the previous American government's technological competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state grants.
"It's not China that leads academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged the brightest minds at the university to work on researching artificial intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think doctors in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation's artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial resources to persons in academic institutions like the National Foundation for Science and other State Organizations provide financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to include partners from the business and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than 100 million US dollars a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum on changing the name of their country
Macedonian citizens voted on Saturday's referendum on whether they want to change their country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has lasted for several decades and which has blocked Greece's opening negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that its northern neighbour's name represents the suicide of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 per cent needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?"
Actors of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to allow for access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia so that we could live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral authority has stated that no irregularities have been reported up to 13 hours.
However, the outcome was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, joined a referendum on the country's name change in Strumica on 30 September 2018, opening the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of parliament in Skopje set up a small stage and pushed the chairs in front of the tents set by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, a country in which the unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "positive" result would be "the confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will join the referendum, which is below the necessary response.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 per cent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the outcome must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since it took over its mandate in May last year.
Look: player Manchester City Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brigton defense to get a shot
Sergio Aguero and Rahem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, defeated Brighton's defense and took the victory for Manchester City with a result of 2 : 0.
Aguero made his victory crazy simple, achieving a shot in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker accepted the addition in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He broke through three of Brighton's defense players and then reached the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He circled around one of the defenders, and then he crossed them a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English attacker from the first attempt returned the ball to Agueru, who put the right-hand digging ball into the right-hand side of the net and beat Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some trouble with his foot," journalist Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola reported.
"We planned to play which 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're happy he got hit at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues a start in the Prime Minister League.
That shot was made in 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep on Brighton's field during that game.
He beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left-hand side.
Sane pushed the ball several times before Sterling was directed to the station.
The attacker Sky Blues put the ball in the net before he walked into the car.
Manchester City fights Hoffenheim in the team game of the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to disable the progress of Rockies
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the play, there were not too many reasons to insist on the new start.
But always the competitive Scherzer hopes to win against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the National West League, get to play.
The Rockies on Friday night with a victory of 5 : 2 over the Nationals at least secured a place in wild-card play, but they hope to win their first title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw away the atmosphere here in Denver with a multitude of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I'd testify to this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still have to publish a Sunday starter, but apparently they're willing to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who's going to make his 34th start, got warmed up in the throwout room on Thursday and played Sunday when he's usually resting.
The Washington right in this season achieved the result of 18 : 7, average winning races (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of the outcome of the Republican voters in general elections, the President commented on his selection of Brett Kavanaugh as judge of the Supreme Court.
"All we've done will be tested in the cold.
There's another five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big – I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race, and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “See this terrible radical group of democrats, see that this is happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; see evil, corruption.
They don't care who needs to be hurt, who needs to be run to take control and control; so they want power and control; and we will not give them control.
Democrats, he says, have a mission "to resist and interfere".
"You've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "malicious, evil, corrupt and false".
He praised the democratic senator Diana Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee on behalf of the Senate, which caused a loud negation of the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document in public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document – it was really a bad body speech, the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
He does not tolerate personal preferences
I wasn't too surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a number of representatives of the Labour Party who were told not to welcome – and all because of what we said to us.
According to my representative, Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby in the censorship proposal.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with the previous leadership.
In the announcement of the Labour Party's eastern nottingham border meeting on Friday, it was said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I have been working as a local representative of the Labour Party meeting of the General Council on Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today many meetings are taking place in a different tone, and the promise of a "friendly, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since the collaborators I thought we were sharing similar political opinions from me began to demand drastic change of opinion and adoption of attitudes that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – I follow a stream of insulting words on social networks that call for my opposition, which are rejected by the centre’s policies and advise me not to be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because they're comments that are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face a lot of sexual or racist comments every day, but they never give up.
One of the aspects of this political age that disappointed me most is the tolerance of an insulting speech.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer consider different opinions and that with every proposal of distrust or change of electoral rules, we are becoming more and more deeply involved.
Many times in the last two years, they've advised me not to be so loud and tell me that everything will be fine."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school multi-purpose student to fail, I wanted to provide better public services for those who needed them most – either as a local councillor or a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, nor in my last election.
No one in the county of Nottingham East could have been misled by my political stand and the areas of conflict with current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grabbing against Brexit, which will negatively affect households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my election units, whether it's the members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to the revocation or political benefit will prevent me from acting as I think it is in your best interest.

Air – Melrose: 38 : 17 Undefeated Air heading towards the top
Two late attempts may have influenced some of the final results, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to win this extremely interesting day game at the Tenent's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and they're the only ones unbeatable by ten teams.
Eventually, the top defense and better use of the opportunity led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be pleased.
"So far they have tried us at every game and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said: "Every honor to Ayra, they have taken advantage of opportunities better than we have."
The 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson by Frazier Climo led Air, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, which was excluded by the Warriors, enabled Melrose to raise the result, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayra's leadership by one-aester before, in the middle of the day, he hit and made a self-test to change the result for Ayr to 17:5 in front of the stand.
But Melrose started well in the second half and tried Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
At that time, she had a long stop due to the serious injury of Ruaridid Knott that was carried on the carrier, and when the game went on, Air continued a good game by trying Stafford McDowall who realized the Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got the yellow card and Melrose again forced an additional player to pay, and that was the unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The lateral player, however, came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for crashing the climate that didn't have the ball; from the penal strike line, MacPherson made a landing behind Ayra in full swing.
Climo realized how he did it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt on the domestic team.
The Still Game series star seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in the service activities after it has been discovered to be appointed director of the company of licensed restaurants.
A 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, played in a favorite BBC series whose screenwriter and one of the stars, along with a long-term partner in comedy, Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the future of the ninth season would be the last to be shown, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of the company Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun insisted Kiernan wants to join the "growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which does not have an exit to the sea, hopes that the court will assign her an exit to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol a seabed full of elevators in La Paz.
Public buildings report the ocean color flag.
“ We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to bring him back."
In the whole of Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, the memory of the lost sea coast for Chile during the conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive – as well as the desire for the re-shipments of the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia is awaiting the judgement of the International Court of Justice, which is expected on 1 October, after the five-year procedure, and hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistically awaiting the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A large number of Bolivians across the country will see the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the withdrawal of a sovereign entry into Bolivia's sea.
Here's Morales, a Bolivian charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from the verdict on Monday.
"We are the result of the return of the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge for Bolivia's benefit and that there will be little change when that is the case.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The verdict of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final hearings, meaning that the case "was not complex", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interest, they may have been behind for the last four years.
"The question of access to the sea has now been adopted by Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morale's war rhetoric buried all Chile's good will, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue in a moment, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the position that the court made an unusually fast decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement with each other," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the maritime question as a political rat.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to go through the past."
North Korea said it wouldn't happen to nuclear disarmament if it couldn't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm nuclear unless he could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri turned to the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
Commenting on the moment when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, which comes more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Rei says the sanctions have continued due to "lost imaginations" and that the US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will in no way throw the North on its knees.
Washington is not willing to support the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarmament first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another meeting at the top.
But there is widespread skepticism about the serious intention of Pyongyang to give up the arsenal that this country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another meeting with Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion magazines reveal that the last line of big hats was on the way to a luxury store in your neighborhood.
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely protect the sun, do not seek further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion strips presented a line of decoupled giants covering their head for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and delighted lovers of style in the Paris fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats this summer have shaken Instagram, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention on the track.
The example he highlighted was designed by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide range of feathers that completely "takes" the head of the model.
The other loud additions included beads decorated with jewelry, magic hat, even pineapple, but these additions are not intended to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many black masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high fashion pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a spray and a mask, and the other looked like a cornette with a melted ice cream.
If you follow a great fashion phrase – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge caps could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats perfectly agree with the "La Bomba" cushions, a slammed hat with a span of about 60 cm, which is seen in many famous and famous people, from Rihanne to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult brand behind the extremely impractical hat that has subdued social networks on the fashion track has sent another great creation – a broken beach bag almost as much as a model in the bathroom costume she wore.
Closed orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia cuts and white leather lunch, was an exhibition in the summer collection Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 at the Paris Week fashion.
Stylist of famous and famous Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury shops next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills that citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of extraordinary exam results, and add weight to this give individual and shared achievements in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), is trying to provide the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further education and higher education, a career they want to pursue and make them to the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement that school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired subject selected in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in the language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest scores in languages have been achieved by graduates of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent Mandarin language assessment, while 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest possible assessment.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered as important as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools as elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills, therefore, are becoming increasingly imperative for the preparation of young people for their careers.
Since more and more jobs are being asked to know the language, skills are key in a globalized world.
Regardless of career choice, those who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will experience the benefits of such long - term skills.
A person who speaks more languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives him the advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YeGov in which more than 4000 adults participated in 2013, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-way percentage of respondents, more precisely 15% of them.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially those of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good jobs.
Every school in Scotland offers different languages.
Some schools will place classical, modern languages in their programme, while others will be selected for languages considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom 2020.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are professionals in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools allow children to develop an environment in which they can learn to prepare and arm themselves with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
The fact that today’s global business is very important to the future of each country must also be reflected in education cannot be ignored.
Therefore, knowledge of modern languages should really be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer the choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will play in Lakers's dress for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
The fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first performance for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play the first pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes they're gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said to Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell has posted a tweet that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training at the beginning of this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in Lakers, which consists of six games.
"In this phase of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump is holding a meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign at numerous meetings in Wheeling tonight in West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned meetings Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for upcoming elections because there is a danger that Republicans will lose most in Congress after the November vote.
What time does the evening Trump's meeting start in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump's meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia was scheduled for 19 hours after the east time, tonight, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's collection in West Virginia can be viewed online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably comment this week on the candidates' hearings for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh who caused controversy over the charges of sexual abuse.
However, the primary objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans achieve the priority of elections in November.
Therefore, from Trump's headquarters for the presidential campaign, five meetings scheduled for next week are "stimulating volunteers and agreeing, because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Most in Congress is so important to the president's plans that he will travel as many countries as possible as we enter the fire campaign," Reuters, an anonymous spokesman for Trump's campaign, said.
Tonight's meeting to be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract "Ohia and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media", reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the past month. He won in that country in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help a republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve the ranking of polls," said Politologist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia for Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team left their heart on the field before individual raids on Sunday
After three single sessions, a couple's break on Sunday afternoon might be exactly what Ryder Cup was supposed to turn.
"The wheel of luck turns" is a phrase that is especially valuable in sports and in which athletes believe, especially in competitions like this.
Who's the lucky bike now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So, I think happiness is on our side right now," Jordan Speith said at the end of the day.
Europeans are in favour of four points, while 12 points remain to the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their back and cheering up his game in a couple with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after the day.
Spieth played killed from tea to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheery celebration bells became louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points left, and it all culminated in the key route Spieth reached the unresolved result.
After his victory of the 15-hole game, he followed a similar cheering hole in which hope and faith can be recognized that Americans can turn everything around.
"You just have to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
It's all that's left of the team now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
Europe's strange, but unbearable pair has a maximum number of points and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but he avoided a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning series, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, show that just those players are to be won on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun rises above the Parisian Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time at different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly got Alex Noren and Sergey Garcia who had a great performance in a couple's game this morning.
One bogey and two double bogey at the first nine holes in the playground buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they could not dig.
However, on Sunday, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch games couples close by because you can see the interaction of players in a couple, hear advice that they give and those that don't give, as well as study a strategy that can be changed at the moment.
Europeans have so far played better as a team, and in the last day, they enter with considerable advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary fighting, which some, especially the Stateside, have suspected.
Europeans on the last day Ryder Cup come in with 10 : 6
Europeans enter the last day after Saturday's games in pairs with a significant advantage over the U.S. of 10 : 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods brought four points of difference to Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy she had missed in Hazeltin two years ago was more powerful than the American team in the morning games in couples achieving the result of 3 : 1.
The U.S. team showed greater fighting in couples by winning two games, but the difference in points was already great.
To win the trophy, the Jim Furyk team has to collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debuter to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari are known as "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend just another couple who won four points in the game in couples in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they proved themselves powerful in the game against Woods and US debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a victory of 5&4.
Woods, who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some brilliant moves, but now he has 19 defeats of 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs so that partner Henrik Stenson would return to the match with the couples and experience a defeat of 2+1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans didn't all go exactly as anointed during a pleasant day south-east of Paris.
The triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and thus set a ladder high for their American team.
First they beat Spanish Jon Rahma and Ian Poulter with a result of 2+1 in the fourballs, and then they beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in the couples after the lost first two holes.
Twice in all history Ryder Cup team that was still four points managed to return in individual games, although Fury's team only needs an unresolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days in a row, they seem to have a hard time getting hit on Sunday.
North Korea has announced that "no chance" of untrustworthy unilateral disarmament
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday in front of the United Nations that further sanctions increase mistrust in the United States and that there is no way North Korea will disarm itself unilaterally and give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing station and decided to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"But we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't trust the United States, we don't have faith in our national security.
Although Ri has repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea against Washington's "procedural" approach to denuclearisation, which would phase out sanctions for North Korea, his statement is significant because he has not rejected unilateral denuclearisation as Pjonjang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Yong Una and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has required Pyongyang to renounce nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls to reduce severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearisation be carried out and increased pressure by sanctions to enforce its goal, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just the error of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Rei didn't mention whether there were plans for a second meeting of Kim and Trump, which the president of the United Nations was talking about at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
However, the minister stressed that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in have held even three meetings in the past five months and added: "If denuclearisation had been sought by South Korea, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this end."
Whatever the case, Minister Riya's tone of speech differed greatly from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said the goal of the continental United States rockets was inevitable after wicked President Trump called Kim "a human missile" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to "complete destruction" of North Korea this year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage for disarmament, but added that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is denuclearized.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearisation and added: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pjonjang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verified denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop the financing of a nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompey met with Rij at the UN headquarters and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said he was making progress, but North Korea called him after a few hours for "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile location and a nuclear complex that will be achieved if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim revealed that these "appropriate measures" relate to the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilizing Washington's relationship.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University enabled all students to sleep well in an attempt to combat the growing learning culture with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world's best university often have no idea of the basics of care about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes to be the first of these species in the United States.
The idea of the course came after he gave a speech on the impact of deprivation on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came to me and said, "Why did I find this out just now, in the last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important a dream was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the Health Service at Paul Barreira University said the University decided to introduce a course after a serious sleep shortage was observed among students during the week.
The single rate consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student bedroom where students have to click coffee cups, curtains, tennis and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how a lack of sleep affects success and how important a sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then there is a map of campuses with interactive icons that encourage students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture is proud of the whole night's learning before the exam still exists, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and good dream. Sleep helps in the fight against obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, throws it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler to develop a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course throughout the campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all post-graduates to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students include an alarm during sleep, as well as during awakening. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the Circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Eating goal defeat Gerard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge hit the missing defense of Steven Gerrard and ended the match with the victory of Livingstone with the result of 1:0.
The team from Ibrox wanted to win the first round after the victory in February and results 4 :1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches, so his team is now leaving eight points at Ladbrokes Prime Ministership for the Lead Hearts.
Menga reached an event seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers seemed to be out of inspiration and didn't seem to balance the result.
While the Rangers were now falling to sixth place, Livingston rose to third with only one incident of the difference behind the hibernian.
There might be new problems for Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence got a head injury when some object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on the sides and so opposed Ayra to the half-final Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same position that the Hearts last week took action and would be thrilled to see his well-thought attitude dampened every attempt by the opponent.
The Rangers may have had more balls in their possession, but Livingston achieved more with her.
They had an opportunity for an event two minutes ago after Menga was first kicked out of the game that Scott Pittman opened up space to go to Allan McGregor's goal, but the tieman missed that opportunity.
The deep-free hit by Keaghan Jacobs intercepted Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow could only pass an inaccurate blow to the rear lines.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game seemed to play with hope rather than with conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that the judge should have sentenced him to one abstinence within 15 minutes of his encounter with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not consider the Colombian request.
In the first half of the day, the Rangers managed to direct only two balls to the goal, but the former Ibrox doorman Liam Kelly one hit with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the pithoms hit Ovie Ejaria didn't pose a big problem.
Although the 34-minute liveston play slowed the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers have failed to use Jacob's deep back ball again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his privacy and chose Menga for a simple end of the attack.
Gerrard responded during the stand and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had a current effect because the wing player added the ball Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it off his line.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the same game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett made one long hit after another.
Holt's side was able to extend leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide entrance from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement to Glenn Middleton was once again looking for an asterist because he was messing with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes this time.
Almanah: Geiger's Designer
And now the following page from our Almanah at the Sunday Morning show: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the day of the birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hansa" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from that invention developed a device known as Geiger's counter.
From that time on, Geiger's main science platform became the main platform for pop culture, for example in the 1950's "Bells of Colorado" film, in which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans apparently played the major roles:
The man said, "What is this, my God?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s counter, but it is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans said, "Look at this.
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immune system that it recognizes bad cells as part of the treatment
The procedure includes withdrawing immune system cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory
Cells are treated so that they can "recognise" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then re-inject into the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, ovarian cancer was withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes withdrawing immune system cells from the patient, changing them to the laboratory so that they can "recognise" protein called HER2 which is common to many types of cancer and re-injection of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer in the City of Bethesd in the state of Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to withdrawing the immune system cells from the patient and their "learning" to recognise cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukaemia.
After hosting the Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West joined the discussion on Trump and supported him by wearing a hat entitled "Let's Make America Big Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was highlighted in a study during Saturday Night Live's show after a performance with interruptions in which US President Donald Trump praised and announced that he would run for president 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat entitled "Let's Make America a Big Again", he continued to speak against the democrat and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they tell me how you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I were to worry about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live's show started with a satirical jump in which Matt Damon laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech on the social network was broadcast by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was trying to appeal to West by the announcement.
Also, the West complained to the public that they were throwing him behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They made me angry behind the stage.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
They've been harassing me!
They said I drowned," Washington Examiner said.
West continued: "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said he would wear his Superman's coat because it means I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love."
Variety magazine wrote that his comments at least twice caused public unrest, and members of the Saturday Night Live show felt ashamed, while one person for the magazine said: "The whole studio has been shut down."
West was called at the last moment as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
By performing the song "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, many were amazed.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "One of the bravest people: Thank you for making the Mafia available."
However, the show leader Karen Hunter on Twitter announced that the West was simply "his own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his "art") whom I believe to accept and expand the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, saying he would now "be officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, which is also known under the names of Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the reper Snoop Dog, was named Snoop Lion, and of course, the music legend of the Prince has changed the name to symbol, and then to an artist previously known as the Prince.
The charge of trying to kill a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of trying to kill a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant should appear on Monday before the Belfast Criminal Court.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
The star series of the throne game Kit Harington leaned on the toxic marriage
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow who saves a sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy of the throne.
But a 31-year-old actor stared at a cat hero's stereotype, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they need to be strong to gain respect.
In a discussion on The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic matrimoniality in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague of Rose Leslie from the throne game series, admitted that he wanted to "very determined" to face this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at this moment – where did we make a mistake with marriage?" he asked.
"What have we learned from men as they grew up, in relation to the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very male characters on the screen, could partly be responsible for the growth of toxic husbandhood.
He continued: “What is born, and what is born will be learned?
What does he learn on TV and on the streets, and that's why the boys feel they have to have those specific men's lines?
I think it's actually one of the big questions of our time — how can we change it?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys."
He also admitted in the interview that he would not record the sequels of the game of the throne after the end of the next summer and said he "ended with battles and horses".
From November, Kit will play a new performance by True West author Sam Shepard, a film producer and his brother a robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of the Throne's Game.
"I met my wife by recording that series, which gave me my family and future life," he discovered.
Rose played the role of Ygritte in the fantastic series that won the Emmy Award, the love of Kitt's character, Jon Snow.
A couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase of 14% in new cases of disease
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which is a change compared to the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, the Chinese health authorities said that the person infected with HIV in this way is almost gone.
But every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV to sex is a constant problem between the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination LGBT is a big person.
Research estimates that because of conservative values in the country, 70 - 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of the effort to cope with this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV in 2003.
Maxine Waters argues that a member of the public staff has given up information about the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "the theories of conspiracy"
U.S. representative Maxine Walters argued on Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal data by three Republican American senators on Wikipedia's pages.
The Democratic Representative of Los Angeles is convinced that these claims are extending to individuals "ultra right wing", as well as to websites.
"False, lie and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and it was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate committee on allegations of sexual assault by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after the three senators investigated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have published that the IP address that reveals the source of this information belongs to the Waters representative's office, as well as information on the representative's staff member, reported The Hill newspaper.
"These unsubstantiated statements are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and false claims – is not at all responsible for the leaking of these data.
These unsubstantiated statements are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs. Waters' statement quickly attracted internet critics, including former White Speaker Ari Fleischer's house.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temper to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do should not be angry.
He mustn't be offended.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
It has to be quiet and steady."
It was felt that Fleischer was comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to criticisms that democracy was leading to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes in general elections against Waters, also reported on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
Waters said in her statement that her office had announced these false claims "Measuresome bodies and order bodies".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Review of the film "Johnny English: Once again on the job" – not enough interesting Rowan Atkinson fights against the spy
Now it is customary in every new British film to search for messages about Brexit, and it seems that this is the case in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel entitled "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to large screens entitled "Johnny English again".
Will the intruder's own satire about how worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
Incapacitated Johnny English wearing eyes and rubber face once again has the permission to complicate the situation, while his name says more than anything about a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries in which cinematography is not in English.
He is of course a secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims on the "distinct" glamorous reminder of Inspector Clouseau, has Mr. Bean's character and some memories of that guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
His character is also inspired by the passenger and mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV advertisements for Barclaycard and which is the face of chaos.
There's one or two nice moments in this latest film release.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the propeller struck his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor is perceived to be rather uninteresting and unusually excessive, especially now that "serious" film titles like "007" and "Impossible Mission" and itself offer elements of comedy.
Humour seems to be meant for children, not for adults.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is already accepted.
Hacker entered the British spy's secret web network and discovered the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, which unfortunately appears to be Kevin Eldon's short appearance.
It's a glass of Prime Minister's patience, superpower and wartime character who experiences a complete breakdown of the system because he's politically offended: Emma Thompson is trying to be faithful to the character he should represent Theresa May, but she didn't really get the material to do something with.
Intelligence advisers tell her that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English with his head and beard, who is currently employed as the director of some excellent school, but the secretaries teach how to become a secret agent: there are some nice gems here because English teaches rock-style espionage.
Englisha quickly leads to government rooms for an emergency meeting, where she meets Bough, an ex-partner and her eternal victim, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an exhilarating submarine commander who plays Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so the two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty who do everything entirely wrong are returning to action and meeting a beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletin, who was part of Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, malicious Jason Volte, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their exciting journey with absurd and funny stories: the turned into waiters lighted up a fine French restaurant, challenging a huge mess by smuggled into the Volta luxury yacht, and English causes a complete anarchy by trying to use the headphones for virtual reality to find out what the inside of Volta's house looks like.
Everything is done as needed for this last sequel, but as much as the film was attractive and distracting, it still contains a lot of child elements.
Quite a central achievement.
And as was the case with other movies about Johnny English, I was once again wondering if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talent?
The Labour Party argues that the British plan is to work four days a week and will be paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that the British would work for four days a week and would be paid for five days' work.
The party allegedly wants the heads of the company to save workers from the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and give them an additional day off.
That would mean that employees would have the right to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources suggest that the idea could be "integrated" into the party's economic programme and plans for the country to be responsive to workers' interests.
The trade union congress supports shifting to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said to the "The Sunday Times": "A policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but it represents a trend that fits into the approach that this party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the entire industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to provide its support for such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not accept that desire in its entirety.
The spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party's policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to unravel his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take power from the hands of "non-personal managers" and "profit" in municipal businesses.
Office plans in the shadows also mean that current shareholders in water-based enterprises may not be able to regain their full role because the Labour Government could make "debts" on the basis of perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds to provide 10 per cent of private companies with employees who would earn annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has finally postponed the vote on his candidacy for a minimum week for the Supreme Court and asks whether the Agency's conclusion could affect the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility for the FBI to discover something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy felt more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said next to the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after he had been brought forth to you, and I said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, unresolved, unconcerned."
Graham's voice, however, is like he's stuck in a rock.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and really should be a strong accusation to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett rejected everything decisively," Graham added thinking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the individuals she nominated could confirm her claim.
It's been 36 years since that.
I don't see anything changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything about poverty reduction?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty in the world.
For seven years now, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group in hopes that poverty will end by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay the VIP ticket), visitors to the concert had to perform a series of tasks or "stores" such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, telephone calls or any other meaningful way of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen actually, considering that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concerts the right way of convincing people to demand a call for action, or just another case called "clickivism" – where people feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have struggled to achieve a number of different goals.
It claims that these actions have encouraged world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will result in an amount of more than $37 billion that will have an impact on lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group set out 390 commitments and announcements that came from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and managers in the United Kingdom who are committed to "helping children develop to their full potential", with a promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the world's citizens, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in this area.
"With the help of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can achieve that social injustice of nutrition becomes only a fuss in history," said Tracey Ulllman, Ambassador of the Foundation "The Power of Nutrition", published at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5000 actions undertaken to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project to provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on his website, which says, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and difficult journey .
But we're going to succeed, just like they did, and big civil rights and apartheid movements before us, because we're stronger together.
The performances Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae belong to some of the performances on this year's New York event that will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports from the interior minister
Washington can, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner said.
Zinke said that Russia's commitment to Syria is particularly where it acts on a legitimate government's call for an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is that it wants to sell energy in this area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he says.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and the blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke turned to those present at the event whose host was a non-profit consumer energy alliance, which is represented in the United States as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, and for Russia he said it "serves the same trick" in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
Statements were made at the same time with the intention of the Trump administration to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia with a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project (Northern Stream 2), which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country becomes involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" the possibility of running for president 2020, states the state senator Massachusetts
The senator of the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" the presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with the citizens of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she thought she was running herself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman on the front," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for the president."
Warren expressed an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is leading the wrong direction".
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
In a tweet she posted on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey has shown greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% of the votes for potential candidacy and 48% against.
The other prominent names of the Democrats that were discussed in connection with a potential race for the 2020 president are former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palina at Donald Trump's collection
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after reporting in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of family violence that occurred on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, is compared to other families that feel the consequences of PTSP and other wounds that our soldiers are returning with," said the audience at Donald Trump's gathering in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem he kept quiet about and said to his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back firm, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the army, have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilli, Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman, interference with the application of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state, says Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasille Police Administration.
18 states and D.C. support the re-examination of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that reduces asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to provide support to asylum seekers who are politically opposed, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's action against the Sessions brought by the US Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials refused her asylum claim on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come, as countries facing widespread gang and family violence.
The new policy of asylum in the United States has changed the decision of the Immigration Committee in 2014, which allows immigrants who do not have documents and escape from domestic violence, to apply for asylum.
State Counsel for the District of Colombia Karl Racine said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires all asylum claims to be settled on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the prosecution, and such a barrier violates the principle," the court friend's report said.
The lawyers further argued that the policy that slows the entry of immigrants harms the US economy, claiming it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary workforce".
Chief State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum in June to victims fleeing family violence and gang violence.
"Azil is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palau as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting tougher.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusum, as she comforted her boy who was trembling in a fever in the evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palau.
"Vehicle emergency assistance every minute of the body's imports.
The government is depleting clean water."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, reading through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were on board.
Some of the injured, including Two Haris, who had suffered a break from the back and shoulders, lay in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly due to continued severe post-trafficking.
His tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was trapped inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then she followed the silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "smuggling" through "propaganda ads"
A week after official Chinese newspapers published four pages of a long ad in the American daily newspaper that promoted the mutual benefit of US and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump turned to the paid-up Chinese Daily newspaper in the most sold newspaper in Iowa, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in American congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with American elections marked what US officials in Reuters' statement characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for the parties to put forward commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in the escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the beginning of the trade war was designed to strike exporters in countries such as Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former long-term Governor Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "now doubles this abuse by triggering advertising in our own free press."
"Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the news kiosk on the streets of Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were in question.
With the Kavanaugho debacle, Republicans have removed voters before the mid-term elections, analysts warn
Since many Republicans stand with the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and defend him on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn how this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event have been quite exciting, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things can't be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University Faculty of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last instigation of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, will not forget it either tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, quoted newspapers in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang, "The cold is coming!", protesting in the Senate hall while Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee were preparing to continue with the Kavanaugh nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"Enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be beyond all expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, for the news.
"People say they're already on a high level, which is true.
But they could also be higher, especially among women in suburban and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they don't like the president, often do not go to elections."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans continue to confirm.
"It's a real mess for the Big Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
"It's not only about voting in the committee or final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh was sent to a security club, but also about how the Republicans have access to all of this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group helping to select a democrat.
However, it seems that the Americans have been somewhat divided about who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning on him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believe in the truth of Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they certainly or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said he thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the statements Ford made, along with at least one more prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford's testimony before the Senate Court of Justice under oath last week was that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court's trial showed her genitalia at the party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Designer plans to start a new Internet download for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology, Inrupt, is a company developed on the basis of Berners-Lee's open Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee found out that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said thinking on startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal network storage" or POD.
It can contain contact descriptions, bond descriptions, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that the decision is about who can access any information in full.
The company refers to this as "a personal data enhancement".
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce's CEO, is to provide the company with resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, several engineers who have signed a contract for project work, as well as voluntary programmers' community.
Since this week, development engineers from around the world have been able to build their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a media release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).

Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the First World War by the Victorian Cross
Celebrations to the honor of the only Anglican priest who was distinguished by the Victorian Cross as a fighter in World War I were relatively in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won a prize on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out he had the greatest British military honor.
The memorial stone discovered two of his grandchildren on a paradise in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's capture for which he had been granted recognition.
According to the report of the official London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the St. Quentin channel "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and the machinery".
Later he rushed to the front lines and with "unbelievably courage" led the team forward before he ran without any help to the Polish top and cut down three from the military squad.
Colonel Vanna killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never achieve, and that inspires humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the vineyard after the parade, led by the parade orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Praštić Peppu
Imagine that you are staying up all night watching a series of Bellator 206 matches to eventually be disabled following the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 battles, including six on the main list, and in Britain they were shown live at night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in Great Britain remained shocked when the transfer was interrupted by Praštić Peppa.
Many were not even impressed after the fight left them awake until early in the morning.
A fan of the interruption of child cartoons on Twitter described it as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcast at 6 a.m., so they had to be transferred to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice-President for marketing and communications Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Jupi, "Praščić Peppa."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he would adjust his schedule to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I'm considering the resurgence, I think we can probably handle something," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to accomplish anything until we have Sunday, when they already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, many of the inscriptions that were not friendly were circulated.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. lt's a state-of-the-art problem.
I can promise you that next time it won't come.
We're gonna keep five fights instead of six.
It's an accident."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority compared to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to become successful.
A twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school, he wasn't aware that "they weren't all like me".
In his statement on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also said his victory at the Olympics was less important since he became his father.
The regular director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months to rest because of the disease.
As a waster at Laverna's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" compared to others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, your feelings of inferiority and diversity have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed. ”
He says he wanted to prove it was "something and something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medal became a prominent person who bets on LGBT people and took advantage of his performance at this year's Commonwealth Game in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt that he was happy that he could live openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope. ”
A triple world champion said he was surprised by his fall in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the difference in years was never a problem.
"When you're so young through so much," he turned to his first Olympic games when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was hard to find someone the same year but experienced similar climbs and falls.
In June they became parents of their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the stories would be about 'getting a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my golden Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they got tickets to London in 2012.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the first place," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he was breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally became aware that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life to jump in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, it wasn't a better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration for the selection of the first song of the "Proud" singer Heather Small , who was standing in it while preparing for the Olympic Games and who was always interested in it .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at Ryder's shop on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to recover completely to avoid an awkward turnaround.
Mickelson, who played the record 12th time in this two-year competition, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the club in a four-ball and four-ball Saturday game.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the four-time winner spent the day cheering and distributing his games at the gym hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National field, where the long rough terrain routinely punishs inaccurate strikes.
And if I'm not scary enough, Mickelson faces a precise British Open Francesco Molinary in the ninth match on Sunday, who won every four matches this week with his new Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, get to the hot start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Fury said he had confidence in his man more than that and couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, hit me on his back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"There's a lot of self-confidence."
He is famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's how it turned out and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson's gonna score Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the number of Ryder Cups played.
This could mark the end of his career in Ryder's shop that never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence brought certain intangible values in the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the individual matches Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable race.
Danac debuted in a game in Valderram in 1997, where the team of captain Svea Ballesterosa had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a sharp difference of 141⁄2 .131.2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but with a sharp difference," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team who won the result 5 . . 3 on Friday and yesterday led the result 10 . . 6 on the Le Golf National field.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You'll play with full power tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do everything you can.
Nothing's over until the floors are on the panel.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on 12 players that are on our side, but we are absolutely aware of who's standing against us, the biggest players in the world."
Excited by the performance of his players on the hard golf course, Bjorn added: “In this I would never run in front of a mine.
Tomorrow he'll have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and that's quite different.
It's great to play with your partner when everything's going well, but when you're there as an individual, they're finally testing your golfer's ability.
It's a message you have to deliver to the players, and she's got to give the best of herself tomorrow.
Now leave your player alone because he must give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent on the other side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they did with the players, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big turns of the last day, since he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in reply to the question how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning of what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that take-off goes in a certain direction, he puts great pressure on the middle swords.
According to this, we organized our position and settled the boys as if we were, you know, trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to launch a counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahma, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided this group of guys is going in this order because I think it's covering everything," Bjorn said about the selected players for the individual matches.
German new warship reset to standby
The latest frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but will not be ready at least until next year due to incorrect systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The launch of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a leading ship of entirely new baden-Wwerttemberg class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, a military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of an ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg ships, which the Navy ordered in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a strong gun, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-proposal missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include long maintenance periods Õ it should be possible to distribute the latest frigates during a period of up to two years without returning to the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships that are said to enable Germany to show power abroad will by the time of entry into service become obsolete, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate last year reached all headlines, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a sailor has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would render the warship useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships will run a crew of about 120 sailors . half less than on the older Bremen class frigates.
It also showed that the ship is a dramatic burden that reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is twice as heavy as the ships of the similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the price reached an amazing €3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) compared to the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime force is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Parliament's Committee, admitted that sailors actually "misses ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that the problem was increasing over time, because old ships were put out of power, and there were no replacement ships.
He expressed regret that none of Baden-Württemberg's frigates could join the Navy.
National Foundation listening to the secret life of bats
New research conducted on property in Scotland's highland is aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
There is hope that the results will explain the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in managing future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow ordinary and swampy bats, as well as brown long-earned and river bats in the Inverewe gardens of Western Ross.
Special recorders will be set at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile checks using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of voting of bats and what kind it does.
Then there will be a map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will find out which areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of work on housing management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and work on a facility that affects shelters and housing losses.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can flies and certain chemical treatments of building material, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nighttime hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes when it comes to stealing.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the bat very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at Threave's property in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats that live in Scotland live.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a huge space for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good places.
There is, however, much more that we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us to better understand what they need to make progress."
Stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting work on maintenance inside the building, since accidental destruction of a bed can kill up to 400 women and young people, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scottish Federation for the Protection of Bats, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we simply don’t know how their population is progressing.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers are preparing to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has characterized the charges of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published those charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventusa was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he then paid her $375 000 to keep an eye on the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after the indictment was filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says a four-time gold ball winner in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the footballer with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they have called "an unacceptable privacy suspect report," Reuters says.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the football player would seek compensation for "moral damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in the past few years."
It mentions how the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel apartment and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg were reportedly returned to the football room, where he reportedly raped her anal, is mentioned in documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was the "good guy" whom that "one percent" failed.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that he had a sexual relationship with a couple, but that he agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial deal because she "feared revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
A thirty-four-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal now because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer he was transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of a 100m-euro transfer.
Brexit: UK "will suffer forever" because car manufacturers have lost
The UK will "suffer forever" if after Brexit loses world leader status in car manufacturing, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added how "anxious" was what Toyota UK told the BBC that, in the event that Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of waiting at the borders in the Brexit case could cause job losses without agreement.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis production of Burnaston produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My position is that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March without agreement, we will experience a steady production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyot's Director General in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears about leaving the EU without any agreement on possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturer relate to the risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without an agreement reached.
Toyota's production line works according to the "just in time" principle, where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars operating on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a break at the border for which industry says it could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota in her factory in Derbyshire couldn't keep more supplies than they needed for one day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Checkers" plan that offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will enable, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 said for today's programme.
"The evidence not only toyote, but also other manufacturers show that we absolutely have to be able to continue this very successful range of supply chains."
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “As far as my experience is concerned, after your business is gone, they never come back.”
The government spokesman says: "We have issued a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Counsel Rod Rosenstein could "suspend for another week" as the fight continues about the candidate for the trial of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, links between Trump's collaborators and Russia's possible interference with justice by the president.
The question is whether Trump is going to fire a deputy state attorney, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, he's been spying on rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this statement.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of an announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid interfering with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be delayed for another week, taking into account everything else that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press."
Some journalists would argue that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Head Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of a press conference was not a consequence of the reluctance to "theatrical behavior" of television reporters, although she said, "I will not oppose the fact that I am distracted."
She then indicated that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organises more meetings for answers to questions than one president before him," she added without stating the evidence: "We analyzed the numbers."
A brief speech will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to ask the US president directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to make it possible often, and you could have seen it in the last few weeks, and that's exactly what you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short talks with journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performances in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff employed in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter that was incomplete six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already pledged to bear the costs of applying for the residence status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued during the summer, moving towards the expected decisions this fall.
However, the United Kingdom government also reinforces preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would now like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The line player team Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation after having suffered head injury in the Saturday defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores Club with a result of 31 to 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Coach Tennessee's chief, Rod Reed, told reporters that the damage happened immediately before the half-time.
"He came to the playground line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the carrier and sent it to further search.
A representative of the State University of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was no "type/range of injury" detail and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of toy train, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five drums before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 drums in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
That step will neutralize Corby's success to attract young voters
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Risnica expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that higher taxes will be charged on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be understood as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters to the promises that it will ensure more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The tax increase will be charged by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to fight homelessness.
The additional fee which is charged to the current fee, including the increase entered into other houses and properties purchased for issue two years ago, may also be up to three percent.
The Risnica expects that this move will bring together 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built property in London is purchased by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country have become "spirit cities" especially in the capital city due to a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help a greater number of young people come to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of property by taking but not using the country, and called on Mrs. May to give up the quota on price-friendly property in order to repair "the shame of the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including housing controls and the end of the no-caused investments.
He also wants to give councils greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year, I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that every new generation should live better.
And that means repairing our failed residential market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it cannot rightly be that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with foreign birth, can easily buy homes as well as valuable British.
The dream of home possession has become too far away for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" was one day to become Scotland's manager.
Scotland (42) enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the Northeast Club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than the leaders.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after last season he again led St. Mirren at the Scottish Football Championship.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always dragged me back.
But this opportunity could still be realized only if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland's location include Dick Advocata, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
Former chief Allo Athletic says he wasn't afraid because he inherited such famous names in such a big club, after he previously refused calls to Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment will be measured according to whether I will be able to bring this club back to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross has just completed his three-year managerial career, after a period during which he was assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloi recover from the fall into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the fall to the winner of the title of the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," recalled Alloe's takeover.
"I really believed that governance was what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, making a solid profit, and enjoying quite a successful time.
But the game can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and stress, but management seems like a real thing.
I've always wanted to run, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for painting is at 17:30 on Saturday, as research shows
The summer heat wave increased revenues for British pubs who were struggling with finances, but increased pressure on the chains of the restaurant.
Data show that pubs and bars have achieved an increase in income in July by 2.7 per cent, but revenues in restaurants are reduced by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the business advice of the Office of the Chief Controller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the good time and participation of England in the World Championship that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being more affected.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant revenues in June only deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars where mainly served drinks have achieved much higher gains under equal conditions compared to losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where mainly served food also died because of the heat, although not as dramatic as the restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed beer and bar, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the sale of food dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for vacation and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to face difficulties, although sales will fall by 4.8 per cent at the annual level will be particularly ill due to constant cost pressures.
Long, hot summer could not come up in time for local food managers, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August provide the necessary range."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, accounted for 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing up of the share of trade marks.
A system for monitoring sales in the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and an industrial reference value is established.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
The news boosted the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account that shows parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that they hide from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts .
The news increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a clean "main" account to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
A mother who found on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who encouraged the other words “violently rape me”.
Research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC), showed that 40 percent of students aged 11-18 years have two profiles, half of which admit to own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online places where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eliid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Committee
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Sports Committee as an inoffensive director at the annual meeting of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who lead sports to take advantage of its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by making him a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won a 200-400-metre race in 1996 in Atlanta, of his total four Olympic gold, and now a regular BBC expert, could no longer walk after a transient ischemist attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors have said that only time will show me whether or not to what extent I will recover.
It was hard, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again today for the sake of the exercise of agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Shared views on the internet about advertising for the traitor who compares mothers to cows
The company for the production of the traitors by its advertising that mothers who feed their children compare with the cows that the husband woke up with shared views on the Internet.
In order to mark the launch of the product for which it is claimed that "the first silent bearer is a traitor in the world", Elvie published an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a stable full of shade and cows with music whose lyrics say, "Yes, my husband, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't weird, it's my breasts."
Then the reference reads: “Supply, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, husband of your ladies.”
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, caused a controversy over the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it illuminates the "horrible" dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, except that their children steal a few days after birth," wrote one person.

Another comments: “Extremely traumatic for the mother and the child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors to mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, "Fullly wireless advertising."
The others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that her song was "miracle".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I could get another one, I'd buy one.
The betrayal of milk made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it was.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another person commented: “This fun commercial is aimed at mothers who issue milk (often at their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like ‘requirements’.
This is not an advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with discreet traitors located in the chest.
The concept of campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wire or pipe and discreetly fits into the breast for breastfeeding, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “Elvie's publisher is so revolutionary a product that he deserves courageous and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between showing women and cows we wanted to focus on publishing and all its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and understandable way demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time that traitor Elvie has reached the headlines.
During London’s weekly fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion strip for designer Martu Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained has increased although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the difficult rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to accommodate children under the care of the sponsor.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid to risk their own possibility of staying in the country by acting and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for the sponsorship of minors without a escort.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been recorded in criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's home in the country are illegal, and most of them are criminals.
That's why we're continuing our search for those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the workers of the shelter, with a view to speeding up the procedure for children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was a standard earlier.
Many will appear through a videoconferencing call, not personally, in order to bring their case before the immigration court for legal status.
Those who do not meet the aid criteria will be quickly deported.
According to the statements of the shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the last few months' systems, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent trials or attempts to escape.
Protesters have said that these concerns are expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, it is very likely that signs of the child's suffering will be overlooked.
They have added that moving children to the tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet their friends can cause the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Mouale, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the sides of the forces were against the law on Syrian soil, in the face of the fight against terrorism, and that they would "consistently act".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," the assembly said.
Moualem insisted that "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011, more than 360 000 people have died, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly practicing and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugee, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help restore Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the end of the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a zone buffer in Idlib's last major rebel platform created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a mass attack by the Syrian forces with Russia's support to a region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including the Nusra front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, "which will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to form a post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, saying that the work of confidentiality should be limited "to the revision of the members of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump's gonna win another term
According to that logic, Mr Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many Liberals are likely to hope, the appeal and scandal are too early to end his presidency.
In what would without a doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the viewer's murder at the moment.
Since 2014, visibility in the impact period has doubled to more than 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the impact period, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed viewing with even 3.5 million viewers on the evenings of the main news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer producer of ABC's "Designated Survival" drama, about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy author and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Trusts About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers driving by taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he's smiling at me," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on the removal of origin from the Roe v Wade procedure, whether immigrant families can reunite themselves and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
However, you surpass the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts already six hours ago discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep background" for his Fair book, about Paul Manafort's coat of noose skin worth $15,000 (the "unprecedented object of poverty", Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, Mr. Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, Super Maria will never look with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that something feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and actor of the show "Zlagaonica", about the rotating acting set and the daily complications of Trump's show (combat with N.F.L., thanks to Kim Jong).
You can't afford to miss any episode because you're gonna be left behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleys this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauji, it was sunny at a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was in there watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court depended on the end.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money out of the way is left in the most uncertain mid-year election race for Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the refurbishment of the congressional districts resulting from two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently refurbished district of Pittsburgh's suburb stands out as a Democrat Conor Lamba who won a place in the second district in the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely intertwined with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were unconcerned for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign to fund the main fundraising parties, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in the widely followed special March elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congression.
That position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a district with a preeminence of 20 points.
Political analysts have given little priority to democracy.
The United States is considering whether to punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then withdraws
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little Washington resistance.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel from Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the management team of the Trump organisation.
State Department officials have decided to invite US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," spokeswoman Heather Naurut said.
However, the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received estimated US$ 140 million in 2017 for, among others, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in preventing migrants from moving to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that they had actually suspended any review of El Salvador's sentences.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-November, as a sign of the importance that the administration adds to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or punishment from Washington.
Speaker of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates on an anonymous basis.
Their report confirmed an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next preparation could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's judiciary, which is now being given very significant public evidence.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to appear before the electorate again, and perhaps in the end and with the jury level.
There are many such 'if' and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trum's inevitable fall - nor those similar to it in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only that the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the ensuing massacres.
History revolves around such points of inflexibility, and the incessant march of democracy is accelerating or late.
Americans are now facing a few of these inflexible points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires a deputy state attorney, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these newspapers reported that last year he secretly proposed shooting the president and assumed his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if a recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress, which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we won't fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light a candle for the sabbatical on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers are host to Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that they will win over the Austrians, after an impressive remion in Spain against Villarrela at the beginning of this month, to place them in a strong position to qualify from the Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the vinemaker Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season until the 2nd with Villarrreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and we drew a point.
Maybe we could end up stealing the game, but, generally speaking, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better at the first half of the time, but we were better at the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, among all that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear precept on what concerns they wanted, few people talked about it to their family members.
About half of the nationwide study respondents said they talked to their husbands about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they are not taking steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to take care of them, as your choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care financing can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your own wealth while you have money.
Arrange your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Engage health representatives to identify a reliable person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also consider giving authority to manage your finances.
You want to select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are not able.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on the way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not just finances, it's who the doctors are," Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Hold that plan by the hand."
A man shot several times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times by an air rifle when he came home after the night out.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, reported officials, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Since the communications were interrupted, relief officials were unable to obtain any information from the province of Dongala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the magnitude 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palau after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongali, on the island of Sulawesia:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It has reached a county extending more than 300 km of the northwestern coast of the island of Sulawesia.
The county, the administrative region below the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, particularly the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morowalia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Pala and Dongal have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongali.
Tsunami also hit West Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on 26 December triggered tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: In the wake of strong earthquakes, it hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the island of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The sudden earthquake struck the region of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the fall of the building.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for family violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and the candidate for Vice President Sara Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin (29), from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of family violence, interference with the application of family violence and arrest resistance, is mentioned in a report published Saturday by the state police officer of Alaska.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is in custody of Mat-Su and is detained on an unsecured $500 bond, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where on the matter of the plea of guilt he explained "innocent, of course," the network reported.
The fuel is charged for three Class A violations, which means it could be in prison for up to a year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palina's convictions have been filed.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the court of vets in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with family violence, interference with the application of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin criticised the veterinary groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of deaths is expected in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the immediate vicinity of Central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
There's video footage on social networks showing a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunamis hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfill Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people have been killed, a rare sentence that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a truck to rent a store Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he cut down pedestrians and bikers who were on his way in October
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentional" killed eight victims and "intentionally" suffered serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intention to seek a death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, in accordance with the judicial document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipova's federal grand jury struck a 22-point indictment involving eight counts of charges of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov has caused harm, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci", the intention is reported.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York's last trial of the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a federal case in New York in 1953, when married couples Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both of Rosenberg's were killed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police reported.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to carry out an attack, he was charged.
He also asked to report to the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police reported.
He made it clear he wasn't guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, not to accept the confession of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipovl's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the national army" today during the protest at the conservative conference.
Former Head of the UK's Independence Party said politicians had to "taste pressure" eurosceptics because one of Parliament's members Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative Representative Peter Bone told the jury in Birmingham that the United Kingdom had so far "extended" that Mr. Farage was secretary to Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced in reconciling her deep-separated lines underscores the Torives' rejection of the remainder that join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromise plan "Chequers" in the midst of Brexit's attack, the EU's remaining one.
The allies insisted that it would continue with efforts to conclude an agreement with Brussels in spite of the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its packages and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said in a joint "Leave Means Leave" campaign in Solihull that he wanted to "reject the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were the chief, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of the Wellingborough parliament added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Addressing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our own laws into our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the statement that the public opinion changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
Brexit's conservative and consenting Andrea Jenkins was also in the lobby, addressing journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to people.
Plan Chequers is not popular in the public, the opposition will not vote for him, is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually those who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
Ms. May added in her statement: "Premiers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the gathered that politicians must be forced "to feel pressure" if they are going to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'that won't happen to you."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is at the edge of Brexit’s betrayal, to feel pressure.
We are mobilising the nation's army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not calm down until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remains agreed to march through Birmingham before holding a two-year meeting in the city centre.
A lot of activists were waving the transparency of "Torieves against Brexit" after the launch of this weekend's group.
Laburist Lord Adonis joked with the conservatives about the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Plan, for the unimpeded state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "consider seriously" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "consider seriously that he would run for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a direct association with citizens in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a rally in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's been in the center of speculation for some time so that it could resist the 2020 Trump.
A meeting Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the citizens since Trump took over his duties.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren answered that it is time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman on the front."
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., reported on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in a shooting with the fatal outcome of the State University basketball in Louisiana (LSU) Wayde Sims that took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police published information on the arrest of Ditheon Simpson (20), 11 a.m., at the conference for ET journalists.
On Friday, they released a murder video, asking for help in identifying a man from the tape.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in his head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde got involved to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene and owning a gun and killing Wayne Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and taken to the county police station East Baton Rouge.
Sims, a third-year student with a height of 198 cm who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the first 10 positions last season and on average 17.4 minutes and achieved 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the order assures him of victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a great role in the race".
From his initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and calling on Vettel to attack his team.
Vettel first went to the box and left Hamilton on the market at the beginning, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action of the wheel on the wheel for which the Ferrari driver was reluctant to leave the free interior in danger of delay after a double move in the defence of the third curve.
Max Vertappen left the final order and was the seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race as he trusted his tires to reach a fast finish and beat Kimie Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally got into a box in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valteri was doing a great job all weekend and the real gentleman let me through.
Team did a really great job to make a formation finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad speech of the body
President Donald Trump scoffed at Senator Diana Feinstein's meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court of sexual abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad and ugly and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry, ugly and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publishing and leaking information in the public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you let the information go?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public - aa, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added by imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent in July a letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein demented that information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't let her story go public," Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her in secret and I kept her in secret, which she asked for."
However, her denial did not come to the president’s approval, who said on Saturday evening: “To tell you something - it was a very bad speech of the body.
Maybe it's not, but I've never seen a worse speech in my life."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, whom three women accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that democracy use those charges for its own purposes.
"They are determined to return power at any price.
You see the evil, the filth, they don't care who's going to hurt, who's going to have to run for power and control," says the president, Mediate.
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5 中 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars paid off for the defeat of Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning in Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5 years.
The Giants came in early minutes to the advantage of two naked hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home to balance, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the leadership.
Francois Bouchard evened for Dundee before two goals of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured a victory.
It was the third defeat in the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's team, who came from the background and won Dundee with a result of 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Two's opening game arrived in the fourth minute, more precisely at 3:35, with the assistance of Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the leadership by hitting Beauvilier four minutes later.
In the rush of opening the game, Sullivan's home team returned to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants completed the first third with leadership when he gave his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The domestics regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to a balance in the measurement of force naked at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to lead Dundee first at the end of the second third, and he took care of the win when his team had already been half the time to win in the last third game.
Giants, who lost four of the last five games, hostess from Milton Keynes next Friday.
Air traffic controller dying to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the aircraft escape the earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while securing a safe flight of hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many disappear after the great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to strike the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his workplace at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower, which was drifting heavily.
He remained to ensure a safe flight of Batik Air on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He passed by later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirat, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our heart is broken because of it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of people killed could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says limited access to the cities of Dongali, Sigia and Boutong.
"It is believed that the number of dead continues to increase, as many bodies are still under the ruins, and many could not be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson of the agency, said.
The waves that reached the height and up to six meters broke down Pala, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "A vehicle has emergency assistance every minute of body imports.
The government is depleting clean water.
Small shops are being robbed all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is running to help its survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo travelled to Pala on Sunday and told the country's armies: "Please all of you work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
The fall of aircraft in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man runs as missing after an aircraft crash in the lagoon
The airline that owns the aircraft that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is running as missing, after it has been previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members are safely evacuated from the aircraft that he drowned.
In his announcement, Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon I cannot follow one of the passengers.
The airline reported that they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in trying to find the person concerned.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the other passengers and crew after the aircraft fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday, and that everyone was in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the American Navy said the aircraft landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some fathers thought the plane was missing the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to get through the water that took them to the exits in case of the danger of the aircraft that was sinking.
He said the stewardess panicked and yelled, and he suffered less head injury.
The US Navy said that sailors working near the port repair also helped save by using a boat to blow people to land before the aircraft sank in about 30 meters of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that in the accidents of air carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, 111 people died, but none of them included Air Niugini.
Analyst exposes the time of night in which the woman is burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded a case in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to put together a puzzle about the move of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location data from several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was on his own claim with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "was lying, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was what Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, some time after Chamber's death, deleted her messages, calls and contact details from the phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's a bright hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude toward the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The song group "The High Breed" from Bristol claims that hip-hop music has distanced itself from its beginnings filled with political messages and by looking at social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and hip-hop to make it popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are reborn in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
The New York Grandfather sues for dismissal after "racist" message
The New Yorker is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from a mother in which she is called "one more black woman".
A few deny that they are racists, comparing the charge with "resentment".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out after her first working day arrived in 2016 that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
"NOEE yet another black woman," Mrs. Plasco-Faxman wrote in her wife's note.
However, instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Faxman found herself in an "unfavourable" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, because, as she claims, their former nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job badly, and instead of expecting her, she was carrying New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a dismissal fee and is asking for a compensation of 350 dollars a day for a period of six months for which she was initially engaged, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied that they were racists, saying that the end of Mauritian employment was reasonable, because of the fear that they would not be able to trust her later on.
"My wife didn't mean what she texted her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband for Post.
"Would you trust your children in the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife was given only two months' maternity leave after her baby was born and that she was in "very difficult situation".
"You will sue someone who is in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not confess to a bear who spoke, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: “It is difficult to put in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time before publication.
It's very fun what we know now about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC filmmaker before the little bald bear inspired him to write a child's book, was optimistic when his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of book publishing was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a man and he wasn't a praiser," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it all happened as if he had achieved his own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is really your work.
I think Paddington's success has been observed that way.
Although it was about his work and his imagination, he always attributed his credit only to Paddington."
My daughter died and we had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried vainly to save her life.
"The hope was regularly called to say that it was really bad and that they believed that they would not get away," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
What I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications given to her by doctors to maintain her heart work slowly lost effect and left her body system.
She died just before boarding, and then everything went off.
I just had to sit there and wait knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was already in mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were not aware of the trials she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and the tears fell all the time down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's messages in mourning on the bridge with a view to preventing suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on the big bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want no parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a chef with an infectious smile waiting for a bright career.
"They all remembered him in his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
However, before his death, he left his job because he was in "a really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I constantly worry that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of cards "how people would know there was someone you could go and talk to, even if he was a friend.
Don't sit still. You need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davies' long-term friend, lost Marka, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at the bottom of Christmas when the children opened the presents, he didn't look them in the eye, he didn't want anything else."
She said that his death was a major trauma to them, but that they had to deal with it: “All this leaves a big hole in the family.
Get rid of us.
But we will continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the end while the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought maybe we could enter a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for in a time-limited and limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "distorted" in the midst of the rooted side block.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unrest was fueled by the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections arrive in just five weeks, November 6th if, as expected, Republicans do not pass well, then they will be seriously weakened in efforts to bring the desired man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly calls the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
They will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pence to break his seat in the Supreme Court with a decisive vote.
Number of escapes from North Korea 'fall' under Kim's leadership
The number of crossings from North Korea to South Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Calling for information from the U.S. ministry, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1127 escapes in comparison with 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors are tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more charges that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
A large majority of the crossings from the north eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China considers the escapes to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them violently.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in talks focused on the ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong in Singapore, when they agreed to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons in a broad sense.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions for not making any progress ever since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not come to the point that under such circumstances we first disarm ourselves," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical", says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
The head of the opposition, Nancy Pelosi, called the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh a " hysterical" and said that because of his temper he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if she had ever acted like this, she would be called a "hysterical," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally detonated the claim that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and suffocating as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also strongly condemned the committee's democrats, calling charges against him "gross and coordinated polling" which they organised liberally angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the work of the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had prejudices against the democrat.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
The question is whether he will try to call Kavanaugha if it is confirmed, and if democracy gets the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi is silent.
"I'll say the next thing if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not able not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the county of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Act on Access Concern or the Law on the Disposal of the Origins of the Roe v. Wade procedure, because it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful'," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Reasoned criticism, anger that has accumulated for months and years, all of this cannot be resolved without payment.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be the executive director and who said that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started to cry, the person who spoke with her said: ‘ Maybe I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, partly because they are generally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in the office where men dominated, is how, once I cried because of unspoken anger, an older woman, a cold manager, who always got a little scared, dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad, so they will be glad because they think that you have been struck."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-court case on the Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for the president.
"It wasn't a well-designed decision," she said 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Snow and Seven Birds".
Since the campaign was already slowed down, she was lagging behind with the fundraiser, and swore she wouldn't be in the race if she didn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her consentors, who gave the men $1,000, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she asked.
While she was saying that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for the people who supported her, by frustration over the system that made it difficult to collect money and to target voters instead of delegates, and by anger over the sexism that she felt her throat.
"You'd think I'd experienced a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to the media.
"You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they're gonna put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of a trade war between the US and China has become louder and, while the battle is far from over, the gap between countries can be of use to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year, condemning key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week occurred with new customs duties affecting products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of all goods coming to the United States of China.
Beijing has returned in some way each time, and recently customs has been introduced from five to ten percent to 60 billion dollars of U.S. goods.
China promised that the U.S. would respond to the blow with a blow, and the second largest world economy would certainly not surrender soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by a waiver of the demands, but public submission to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure of the US trade war can provide a long-term positive support to China by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the launch of economic repression in both countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a scientific think-tanker who focused on Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees," foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country that has destroyed a war that lasts more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence have been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US team with a final result of 16.5 月 10.5 on the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown while Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured during almost the entire tournament, sent a ball to the water at the first blow, leaving the match to Francesca Molinaria.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of the 4 players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament started this format.
The American Jordan Spieth kicked Thorbjorn Olesen out of Denmark, the lowest-ranking player of the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 from Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder buyers, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became European with the most winning tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop tears.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I won the buy again.
I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, full of emotion after a European victory.
He's carrying a torch to his fellow national John Ram, who won a legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, in a two-way match on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride over the victory over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahman.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now he's got a 13-21-3 record in Ryder Cup.
The unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 headlines, and is right behind Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing top golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, US captain Jim Furik said: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we have provided resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna get busy, we're gonna work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Board, so we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to take off the hat of people.
We're overrated."
