What are they supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague don't know the Voldemort or the "Conditorei".
The new city councillors from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-fashioned colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once "crushed" members of the new council from the ČSSD, as they rule the notorian snake, which has become a citizen in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were at the ruder.
The coded vocabulary introduced in the busy era by Mayor Pavel Bém of Prague's political elite is perceived by some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed that these new terms are something in the dark.
At least they claimed that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am rather a new figure in Prague's politics," said Lukaš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, on the test of the "patent-word treasure".
But also the Councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "Golfoch".
"That's the only expression of those who present you to me here, which I will use again and again."
" Otherwise, I don't think much of a snake."
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election Congress, the editorial picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest Prague Golfloch", "go to the confectionery", "stirnacken", "defeat of the capital" and "blame".
Three Prague Councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague School of Education - promised his participation in the conversation first, but did not even take the listener off.
The fifth Councilman, Peter Dolinek, rejected the test.
"I don't care about these things, and how the civil democrats treat each other, I don't judge them."
"It's important to me how we understand each other in our programs," he said.
As already indicated, Lukaš Kaucký would probably not have recognized in the above-mentioned strike line that the speech is by the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bem, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all, and the only term that he did correctly during the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"That's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, but added to the security: "But I know that from the paper."
And ridiculously, "I'm gonna have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Counselor for Environmental Questions Lukáš Plachý correctly as a blanka tunnel.
But both social democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukaš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and also what it means to "go to the confectionery".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is about the headquarters of Janoušek companies.
Consistent with Březina, however, he argues that he had created this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this treasure of words was his own.
According to the test participants, it does not seem that there is in fact a similar line of citizens among the social democrats.
"I have asked my colleagues, too, but obviously there is nothing like this with us."
"We call ourselves by name, back and forth we also use shorts or nicknames," says the President of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský - named after his partner's son-in-law "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly with the "Opa" or less friendly with the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who was paying attention to the party sponsorship before the elections, is called "Igráček" by some colleagues (known Czech Lego figure).
First names are the only thing that allows the Social Democrats to use in their own language.
Hulínský may not be allowed if he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another top name of the President of Prague.
His top name "Doctor der Gummiknüppel-Rechte" is supposed to be that Petr Hulinský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to banish the torture of "Hexen" and issue a brochure
Women who are stamped to hexen in Burkina Faso usually show some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they don't find work - for example for health reasons, they're free and they don't have children.
If one of these women "becomes a witch", she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women are also spared this because they help with work and give birth to children," a sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special house caring for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against this disorderly "social measure".
And for this reason, a brochure was issued that was intended to link the "hexen persecution".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the paper "the Standard" pointed to the dilemma of the written explanation.
But in other African countries, the witchry is also going and giving.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Amy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they poured oil over them and burned them down.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would only have been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil is flammable, which will be used for ritual anointings.
And after the group tried to "drive out a bad spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here regardless of their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "Freshers of human souls are at risk before today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to sharpen the hexenjagd, the Gambian President himself has been working well last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh invented a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunts, as they allegedly had a share in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"In addition, he called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea, who, along with policemen, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, violently drove women and men out of the Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," the Amnesty International reported.
On the farm people were forced to drink an abstinence of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused problems of the intestines and kidneys.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant from Bakala: It is hot in the oven - yet it pays higher rent
An older man is leaving the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "cohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new rental contracts for three apartments: for his daughter's own and his son's own apartments, which is just a prison sentence.
All three were raised in the framework of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rentals, the son is expected to shave 4100 kroner for a 2-room apartment next year with kitchen in the second category.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he writes angryly with his finger at the new contract of the son's rental, to which he has a full authority.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-confirmed and half-resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Society, which called the new lease terms "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7th, where they think of a guide as being against such contracts.
But the man only wins.
"One says it, the other says it," he makes a window's face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming the major deregulation laboratory.
After New Year's, this deregulation is in front of most apartments in the Czech Republic whose tenants do not pay market rent until now.
Current.cz therefore decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG Warterarum in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a phone.
"Rite 2011", a special keyboard lights on the touch screen.
Briefly typed and the device already extracts a number list.
We have barely deciphered the number "157" and already tapped it on the large display on the deck of the waiting room.
A half second later you're on the line.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the stress in the waiting room obviously does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repairs, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the envelopes with the new rental contracts are sold to most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action takes a little over a week, which means it's only the beginning," the ladies answer behind the switch to slow down after a moment when the "client" comes out as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a brilliant theme.
Prior to the elections, the parliamentary vice president from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from the ČSSD, had taken up this topic quite openly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new foothold from them."
"Not even wet. WC glasses could change them," the man mentioned at the entrance said.
So far, employees are, according to the tenants, particularly on the switch, in order to be sure that they will actually receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who are signing the new lease by 15 December, are also expected to enjoy a semi-reduced rental.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded by demand.
"Of the 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were due here," the shift officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as wall tables where it appears necessary.
But if the rent parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but it is as information about the only legitimate and legitimate legal procedure to understand," explains RPG on its website.
"No one goes to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street before the client center gives her at least part of the right.
"I have 13,000 (Kronen) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where I should take the money for a court case," he says.
Then the employees will be insecure.
"Look at you."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so wait for the people to leave," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic in New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing height of rentals is not enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - just the neglect of the housing fund that the tenants have criticized is, in the opinion of the houseowners, the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the deck opposite the poster seats in Havířov's waiting room, a few red-lighting information appears again and again.
"The rent increases in 2011 were 15% and less 31 200 apartments, which means more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"It always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square metre and month", is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only in 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG will the rental increase by 38 percent.
"In these cases, there is an extremely lower rental price of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation does not jump to height, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What's more - the company has a further obligation: All income from the rent increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the heat block.
But, above all, they will benefit from those who sign the agreement on the increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a children's garden
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of Arch.Design.
But who here would expect a mini-child garden, with everything included: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing space on the outdoor terrace.
This children's garden has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which the studios come a number of famous Brünner buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the rooms for its company mini-mini-garden.
In short, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the babyboom age and the company is based on the fact that the project antennas and architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work briefly, the kindergarten is another bonus, the Arch.Design its employees in the concept of their social programme.
The construction engineers and architects have it so much easier to bring their demanding profession and childcare under a hat.
The mini-child garden is an original idea of Arch's employees (in) design and with the support of management, they managed to earn funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment is funded by the European Social Fund and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
This funding (CZK 2.8 million grants) helped to provide the necessary facilities and equipment and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After exploding the funding (2 years), Arch.Design is required to continue operating the mini-child garden for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place all year round, with the company Economic Rating providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
About the children care for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, children can visit the garden without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years of age.
And since this is about a mini-child garden, only 5 children may be present, but the day changes over several children.
The children's garden is flexible to the needs of the parents, who have the same rights regarding the use of the children's garden - regardless of the firm hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-child garden is still comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but in particular they are given excellent instruction - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, in addition to learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games but also equipped with a computer that is available to children.
More - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus escape the stress when the children are picked up from a far-off kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that natural and loyal employer relations are also being developed here.
Arch.Design was chosen among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their staff marketing.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. See the interiors of Gaudi
The roof is like the back of a prehistoric axis, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn-off fish mules.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the people here, the house with its organic forms was given the top name "Bochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the façades and all-current soft lines, all of these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's youth style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, warm colors and textures that remind nature and creatures.
Only with a more accurate view do you notice that everything is governed by geometry, rhythm and comprehensive order.
In the night, the entire facade is still more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same swivel lines and curved shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Well-shaped wood copies the window frames, gels, lock elements of doors, even gutter holes and performances.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Gràcia nr. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, performed by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the prosperous industrial Joseph Batlló, originally stood on the edge of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The rental house Casa Batlló, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with architect Joseph Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists also worked with the design of the facade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the beginning of fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in Park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was found by the inhabitants of its organic forms due to the nickname "Bochenhaus".
Others called it the special window-opening mechanism because of the "close house".
It is also said that on the very top of the building was the sword of the holy George, the patron of Catalonia.
But other imagery elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time being.
Something strange is already affecting their 45 degree tendency.
In his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at that time and could not complain about them at all.
Although before the construction began, he obtained the relevant building permit from the city, but the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city's fathers were so disillusioned with the result that they demanded relief two years later.
Among other things, the Councillors also pointed out that the construction with its pillars even interfered with the public ladder.
However, there was no change, on the contrary - just fifteen days after this call from the city district, Joseph Batlló made an application for the approval of the renting of the two highest floors of the house - and it was soon granted to him.
The owner himself went to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a living room, and on the third floor there were bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was packed into a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building goes through a stairs up to the roof terrace.
The fundamental elements of the reconstruction removed all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
Gaudí, however, also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and thus could easily boast a larger society without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house was renovated by Gaudís except for a new facade and a rather unusual roof and two other floors.
Gaudís game is also impressive with the light as well as the blue and white glass tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum amount of light.
In doing so, he simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight instead.
The Casa Batlló house, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited today by anyone.
On the first floor the most spacious and beautiful apartment of the public is made accessible.
The houseowners decided only in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly intrusive business, the visits were kept, yes they were also extended to other common and roof-to-door rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building site is not paper, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Whoever wants to know the true atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit it at home.
The right mattress and the right bed linen? Women have desires other than men
Not the best beds, but the quality of the bed area - so mattresses and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be complemented harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
As important is the interior, in which mattresses and rust are to be subjected.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where latex mattresses are not regularly heated, they are not well suited because they take much longer to become "hot".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than ordinary polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
Because if they do not have enough ventilating channels in the core and are still on a hard plate, humidity depends on: So it is not excluded that they form under their mold.
Of course, there is also a role to be played in choosing what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses are common with soft layer, will be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Well, all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep here anymore."
"For their hidden shoulders, furs and hips they just need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I also recommend these also sugar-sick people who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamczyková, who specializes in furniture.
That's why I've provided many ice hockey players years ago, as well as other customers with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the advantages of the visco foam.
This "miracle" really works very easily.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heats, in other words, it usually softens on the warm body.
There's nowhere to say, in the night you don't roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still calculate the length of the soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women who are 180 cm in size need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the bedrooms should have a minimum width of 90 cm, i.e. a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are provided.
The comfort half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following Faust rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on your back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms," said Helena Prokopová, the master of the gymnasium and gymnasium, who has been devoted to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years, and this subject is also presented at specialist schools.
In a double bed, each needs his own rust and his own mattress, but watch out for the purchase so that the mattresses are the same.
Otherwise there is nothing left but to mount the rice at different heights and this is not possible for any bed.
foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall on the shape layer and the fine polish.
"With the hand or with the mount, you must not feel the feathers at all," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully decorated beds with mattresses and floor coverings such as co-arrived siams have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be blown and the relationship cannot be washed, which is already going and given today.
And as you lose sweat in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l, it is clear that the mattress will slowly become a giant (and sealed seven) after five to seven years.
For this reason, experts also reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in mattresses, even life-long guarantees.
Every thing has a time and a time.
And therefore a practical advice from traders: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide, the hygiene of washable, removable links should not be overlooked, yet it is recommended to use a mattress cleaner that can be easily removed and washed.
Even though it is common today to produce mattresses with round-edge closures, so that after opening you get two and a half (very important for the washing process and washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a hard plate in the bed instead of a toast?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should prefer to use the plate with air holes (unless they are already inside) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket springs and fine pillows.
Polyurethan mattresses do not belong to such materials.
For non-adjustable lattes with 14 to 18 lattes (Lamelles), latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconuts) are always paid with a larger number of lattes, i.e. 28 and more lattes, with Lordos support in the field of land vertebrae and the possibility of regulating latte hardness.
No mattresses with spring skeletal are available on adjustable lamella rice, as they do not react to the ergonomic setting.
In addition to the setting of the brakes of the springs, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fixation of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed or even angled so that they allow the momentary incision of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rusts with point-elastic contact paths with so-called multitortion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed to several points, reducing tension.
But if you use a bad (too big and full) headrest for the right mattress and right rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here too, the head box should support the head, its tips should reach only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal, therefore, is a 50 x 60 cm big pillow, as it likes the scanners for example.
In the side area, the headrest (with the shoulder load zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should offset the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the single (heu-filled) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Also in mattresses, the new magic word is called "Bio".
Instead of petroleum oils, it is used to produce polyurethane foams that are increasingly used in natural oils - such as rice and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called mattresses, which consists of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vasíček from the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also get micro capsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance when you sleep.
Here too you make a difference between a man and a woman.
While in men a "cooler" plant extract is used from birch leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, the references to women have a "heating" effect.
Extracts from red paprikascotes cause blood circulation, so the weaker sex is likely to be warm during sleep.
And today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and much more flexible).
The combination of the various stiffs (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where heads, hips and ferns are.
For a high quality mattress, however, you have 7,000 kroner and more to shave.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with less value added tax as they are considered as medical devices.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
You can see it's not that easy to save on the mattress and on the rust.
Over and over there are special offers from manufacturers and traders that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The brand Magniflex offers the mattress duofreeze with a visco foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one is free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density into almost cosmic tempo.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overloads at the beginning.
Tempur is softened by heat, in a cool environment it is fixed again.
It fits perfectly with the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
Therefore, it is not only ideal to prevent pressure fires, it generally increases the comfort of sleeping.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special footrests, which are intended to facilitate the bones and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foam substances Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to have the kids under control
The fear of their own children grows and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system originally designed to drive to cars can be as good as people, which would also be helpful in such cases as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is now about as big as a cigarette box but it should soon not be larger than a bracelet.
Many people have shifted the case of missing Anička into fear and fear and thus keep them looking at means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of affecting their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," says Peter Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases, such devices may be misused, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without knowing about it, but we haven't had to register such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočová points out that if it doesn't bear such a thing, it just relaxes.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don't want to be controlled."
"Even though the phones initially raised great expectations with the parents, they can easily turn off just like these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In planned kidnappings, the Kidnapper almost always checks whether the child has any electronics that could be located with it."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such monitoring devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, police criminals are always a step ahead," says psychologists.
However, it concedes that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to the company RC Monitoring, Roberta Čech offers location services for cars as well as for people, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tilting meter is integrated, that is, if you fall and lie still, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, only one needs to play a special software.
The problem with the current location devices is that it is either in the case of devices in strip wooden box size, which are similar to trailers or smaller phones.
There's always the danger of losing it.
According to the Macro Weil, Mr Pilin is therefore tested in the present devices, which look like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that the attacker must not at all recognize that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he only notices after some time what the police give a time," he adds.
No matter what direction the development takes - to armrests or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in the vehicle location.
So for the combination of location function using the GPS system (as well as the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many firefights that you can turn all over the Czech Republic but you can keep only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometres of fire hose, which is fired with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of firearms to the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that the forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the fire hose from the stock company STV Group, for example for 40 million kroner.
In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of fire hose, the General Staff MF DNS replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 km of fire hose annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnics, which MF DNA claims, this indicates that the entire army had to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to secretaries and women of polls.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
This was the only way to justify the remarkable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of firewood.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of each new professional soldier, two meters of firepower is sufficient, then the army, through these new purchases - even in the light of the increasing need of the pioneer and special units - has created a calming stock for the 225 years already mentioned.
In doing so, soldiers of the quick-implementation brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defence Vondra that they had almost no firearms cartridges, so that the lack of resources was severely restricted.
To keep quiet about the underpants.
"I also don't know why they're buying such a bunch of fire hoses from us."
But that is finally their decision, they'll know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we want to be most opposed as traders," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of firearms to cover the army for at least ten years with this "munition".
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, only speaks of a four-year term of use of the fire hose and police and army pyrotechnics for only two years.
"It is likely that the four years mentioned can also be stored in perfect storage," admits one of them, who wants to remain anonymous so as not to be seen as a soldier the criticism of the army.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not at risk to the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not unfair, but cost more money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of fire.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," Speaker Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of firefighting by police pyrotechnicians, the liquidation of ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood, has been almost 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that it can consume before the end of the use.
The safety of the pyrotechnics is already the result of the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus reliable furnaces.
Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence has enormous problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovakian Volkslok army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics who claimed MF DNA, the Czech military expects in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old fires, which they have bought today so "favourably".
To this day, I find the contacts I have won through the competition
The successful placement in the competition "Little Entrepreneurs of the Year" helped Lukaš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's competition "Small Businesser of the Year" was Lukaš Pytloun from Liberec.
The history of his success is like a movie scenario.
Luke Pythlon was happy to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
Out of the savings from his work abroad and with a bank credit, he was created a modest house with five apartments.
If you think he was a high school student in the sixth semester at the time, it must have been a brave venture.
"The then price-quality relationship upset me and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately went back to the house, which he then rebuilt step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two quiet restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec in just seven years.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tizé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other stakeholders at the Pytloun hotel franchise have already signed up," says the Entrepreneur Number One of the last years.
"A large share of this license sale for the operation of hotels had just won in the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year", adds Mr. Pytloun.
The victory has brought him greater popularity, yes popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the street, often congratulated me after all, and I have to say that's right," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something participate in this competition.
You don't have to win the same thing. Every visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that would otherwise not have come to him.
"With some of the people I have met thanks to the competition, I maintain regular business relations to this day."
The reputation associated with success is also a little lower on each of his employees.
And there he is at the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be granted general recognition."
I also really consider this not only as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little stuck in the foreground," says Lukaš Pytloun.
I wish my followers a quieter year when we had it in farm
The victory hole was quickly resolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his zeal, Farmet has the worst behind.
The price for the first grade of the Vodafone Competition Company last year took over Karel Ždźárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At that time, the jury commended the efforts with which he made from the small tool building in Česká Skalice a company from the ground that makes hundreds of millions of revenues.
"I can say that this respect not only encourages me but also encourages all my employees and our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farme's firm history, the effort was to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father Karel Žđárský as compensation for the property that the communists had taken to him, he did not hesitate for long, left his career in the company where he had been employed, and set up his father's own company with a few friends.
A short time later they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic pressure throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success of the competition mentioned and its medialization has it entered into the consciousness of the non-professionality.
"Not only do our customers now feel the brand Farmet significantly more intense, our foreign partners also began to work together with a company that has achieved the highest possible success in their country to measure greater value," says Karel Ždźárský.
Last year, however, Farm was not only in the sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic performance in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which was even less shocking for the citizens at that time, but above all for the company, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't get away with this situation."
"The sales went back by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even get fired," explains Karel Ždıárský
A viable company must also take such unpopular measures.
But it was possible to get the situation into the grip and keep the company in the black figures, even if with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to withdraw - in the case of investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired major awards at domestic exhibitions," Ždjarský says.
It all testifies that we have overcome the crisis.
Turnovers are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a great deal of joy in victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel Žđárský says.
A survey of opinion, which is covered by unreasonable rules
The opinion poll on the "absorbity of the year" is for the fourth time part of entrepreneurship competition.
Some foolish rules have already been made out of the world.
To doubt the winner of the next year's "absorbity of the year" opinion poll, the obligation to create documents on authorities available online was advanced.
Thus, more than one third of non-four thousand voters decided.
Thus, the Social Insurance Administration requested a paper withdrawal from the trade register, even if it could be accessed by the official through two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing now.
"In the future, the Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require any withdrawals from the trade register when it comes to checks on social security users," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "absorbity of the year" is to take all the regulations and arrangements under the guise that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and remove the foolish ones.
This year is already the fourth part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the so-called Economic Journal (HN) and is enjoying growing popularity in the public.
If last year the three thousand people took part in the vote, it was four thousand this year.
No wonder, for there is still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder business activity.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic adopts the 74th grade in terms of business conditions, compared with the previous year a worse position around eight places.
The competition absurdity of the year was first called out in the year and played out each year after the same scenario.
From April until the end of September, anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
For registration, the website www.firmaroku.cz will then be consulted by the competition organizer for seven candidates for the "anti-price" and will allow the public to vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It triumphs over the absurdity that most voices receive.
For this year's opinion poll, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and regulations have been registered.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are also provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for motorways and motorways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to present every two years.
The list of this year's "Sieben" is published on the sides of the competition.
The call for competition at Prague Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November is part of an event in which political and public life also regularly participates.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Business Operators of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the top of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneurs knots between the legs, there can be no real economic upheaval, so it is my goal every year to remove at least thirty paragraphs that make it unnecessary for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create foolish arrangements from the world have an effect.
In 2007, most entrepreneurs were in breach of their obligation to report their intention to the company at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance to go to an exhibition or Kirmes with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was abolished by a novelle of the Act.
The duty that 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the duty to report to the Labour Office employees' services up to 30 days - was abolished by the so-called "Green Card".
And all the good things are three:
To the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation, which put physiotherapists together, was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two cars in the speech room.
This regulation has been somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the cooling obligation has fallen.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A new feature of this year's fifth year of the competition of the Economic Journal (HN) is the category "Responsible Company 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon company signed up to companies for which success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ in terms of the subject matter of their activities, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about disabled people, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main sponsor of a fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes good care of its disabled workers, who make up 70 percent of their staff, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible company of the region of Central Bohemia"; in the competition Vodafone company of the year it placed the third rank in the context of the region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which, among other things, imported a liquid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a relative wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech producers, supports citizens' initiatives in its environment and works according to environmental principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible in order to keep the consequences of our business activities and administration as low as possible for the environment," explains her CEO, Miloše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem is again located in the health of its employees and has therefore created ergonomic seats and keyboards for all notebooks, as well as is promoting the use of catering services provided by a home-protected workshop for its employees and for company operations.
"In addition, we support the "People in Need" Foundation, which provides concrete assistance to this Roma community," says Ondřjej Suchý, the company's representative.
In addition, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čistení" from the Karlsbader region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance, is also mentioned.
"We give our employees contributions to the maintenance, the work route, the increase of their qualifications and the holiday," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mahrish-Schlesian region.
To category Responsible Company of the year, all district finalists of the contest Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they were excluded from the competition "responsible company of the year", but were not disqualified in the main competition of Vodafone company of the year."
"A separate registration for this competition is not possible only because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Sodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the building of the Ground Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have undertaken arrests in the last days.
The current media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was executed by the detectives in handcuffs.
This alleged that it had tried to manipulate a direct public competition for the settlement of claims for damages in such a way that the assets offered in the competition were of a specific interest.
This Luboš G. is supposed to have paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police prosecute a person for the crime of fraudulent machining in public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the chief of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the Právo newspaper, could not grant any further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police.
In what way he managed to manipulate public competition, you can only speculate about this in view of the tangible official information.
The spokesperson for the Lubomír Černá referred to the question of Právo, which the police had actually made in the Pilsner side of the fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and spending the night with one of our employees," she said.
According to Ms. Černá, the public competition had the correct name "An order for the supply of claims for the transfer of property under the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants are interested in the property offered.
"These persons shall, in the context of the request, offer a higher value of their claims to be covered by the transfer than the value of the property declared."
"In accordance with the requirements offered, the order of potential buyers is determined and the land fund then transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the fund.
Luboš G. was clearly aware of the fact that he had signed up to the invitation and that he was a legitimate person, since he had bought himself a number of claims of restitution, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat invention.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. already had very good contacts with the Pilsner Foundation in the past.
He also played a role in the cause of the former head of the Václav Sankota Ground Fund, which was criminally prosecuted because he issued property in replacements that had already been subject to site decisions on construction projects.
At that time Luboš G. from the Land Fund also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely in the place where the construction of the access magistrale was planned for the Borske Pole area.
Later he exchanged this very cheaply with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which surpassed the value of the property.
At that time, the Council had to have a hard heart to keep the construction project from being endangered by the blocking of the land.
Household housing costs increase by a few hundred per month
As of January, the budgets must not only bear higher costs for all types of energy, but also pay higher water and water charges, and rents also grow for remote heat and in some places.
As of January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns out of the wallet every month more than ever.
Power will be up to 4.6 percent cheaper, gas will be up to 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places you will also need to consume the remote heat supplies.
Only the electricity taxation costs the apartment budgets a few hundred kroner a year.
The strong electricity prices were reduced by all main suppliers, so it is due to the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely photovoltaic equipment.
Gas is only going to be more expensive, however, precisely when people have to heat most and have the highest consumption.
So here too is to be calculated with several hundred kroner more per year.
While electricity and gas are cheaper throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary.
Primarily larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more than 50 kroner per month from January to pay more than 1000 kroner per year for remote heat, and families in Liberec pay more than 1000 kroner per year.
The inhabitants of Prague are threatened with 9 percent higher water and water charges, and this is in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, is still among the lowest in all of the Czech Republic.
In the northern tree, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges should rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments where the so-called rental regulation will be removed from January.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rentals by 100 percent from January.
Those who do not agree with this increase in rent are interested in the company's legal interests.
The regulated rentals that are still paid in about 300,000 apartments today should increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with remote and Rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Farnet, Rum and Vodka, except once a good whisky that was stolen from the home bar by the father.
These are the drinks that the Czech teenagers who enjoy must be treated under fifteen most frequently.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep their catheter repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the admission of children to clinics.
"Beers or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the Children's Department in the Central Bohemian Clinic of Horóvice.
"Whisky, if he manages to remove a bottle from his home bar, and if he doesn't, then at least remote or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strongly," explains the Chief Executive.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him permission.
"Most often it's about remote or rum."
"That's today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz who was taken from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to Chefarzt Pelikán, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers in hospital admission have not been exempted for a long time.
Before the hospital in Horóvice, where he has been working for ten years since this year, he worked in the Paediatric Department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunk students from nearby and remote.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began at the age of 12, when it was first delivered with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly difficult case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice on some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief priest said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in attacking with their own sprayers that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
For a real dependence in the true sense of the word, there are no experts according to children.
"Under alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and that is not the case with these children."
For those who drink alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinová, spokesperson for the hospital Motol, about 40 children who were drunk were assigned to this department for children and youth medicine by mid-November.
However, only cases of heavy alcohol poisoning requiring hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Encouraging children who are brought home after an ambulance treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to cases where children only sneeze such a bottle of snaps in the school bank, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three annual amplitudes on which there is a hundred percent reliance: Walpurgis night, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The last one for two reasons - either because of the bad testimony or because of the joy of the holidays."
"On the night of Walpurgis, I have also experienced seven drunk children at one time in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who has only to fight with an unpleasant catheter the next day.
The headaches in the morning, resulting from dehydration and lack of glucose, can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-dependent infusion with glucose and nutrients lacking in the body.
"They are clearly better at it, because after the "great" experience in the evening, they wake up with good pay without any pain."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, who at least loses the good pay by counting the costs of the treatment.
Because the transport with the rescue car and the night in an emergency bed are well worth a few tens of thousands of kroner.
"I have used it as an educational tool once and for all, when I have directly taken care of the children during the visit, which has cost them their drunkenness and that it can happen quite well that they will have to work over the whole holiday to earn the money for a single such fat," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the hospitals do not resort to regression procedures in order to require the parents to pay the necessary costs for the care of the drunken children.
Two training planes L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 of a total of five, which replaced the Czech Ministry of Defence against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
They have so far been seen only at maneuvers or air shows.
This is the two-way version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are single L-159.
These are still preserved in Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over last week.
When the aircraft is physically dispatched from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
The L-159 single combat aircraft were, in turn, separated from long-term aircraft, without further investments and investments from the Ministry's resort.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance," said Právo newspaper Pejšek.
He added that the army would not have to leave without two-seat combat aircraft, as in May 2009 the Ministry of Defence signed with Aero Vodochody a 200 million contract on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, the second will take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has undertaken to implement the combat aircraft in the equipment of one of NATO countries.
"The contract states that EADS is the takeover of L-159 aircraft and that it is intended to train NATO pilots.
"It is therefore the matter of the customer, how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a vehicle Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not signed an invitation to tender, but called directly on EADS.
The Defence Office then argued that this exchange will support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which she only used 24, to sell the rest.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa should still have a judicial example.
The European Commission appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence, namely the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, which is scheduled to land in the last fourteen days at Kbely Airport.
A longer finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This should be related to the male hormone testosterone mirror.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this, in particular, for men up to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, added Mrs. Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain persecuted more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study, the finger on the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was considered, as for 19 percent of men whose rings and fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose fingers were longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty-seven percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is just accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, that this study was known to him in a flash, yet he still does not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "complete".
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snowboard on Thursday morning.
On the streets and lanes are usually snowy, the winter servants were mostly on axles all night long.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked by some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This said Novinky.CZ of the Dispatcher of the Central Auto Motor Club (UAMK).
At 91 kilometers a truck crashed, at 93 kilometres two trucks met, in which case there were injured.
A few cars are also in the street grave.
There are also problems at 185 kilometres of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here too, two trucks crashed.
Drivers should drive straight behind Brno at 190 km or above Brno and at 182 km at Kývalka.
There are a few miles of staus.
On the D11, too, an accident has occurred and the same is true of access to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeter thick snowboard and the thermometer shows less than seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns are formed in the town of Prosek, also the road Štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The roads run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis team meets.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech Railway had to cancel seven high-speed train connections due to snowflakes.
Problems exist, for example, on the Prague-Kralupy route or also Prague-Berun.
Travelers should be informed of the current situation.
The Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the streets in the south of Māren can only be maintained with increased caution.
Around Vyškov three side roads are completely inaccessible, in the vicinity of Brno there are instead snowflakes and in the vicinity of Blanco it is forced to use snowflakes on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three roads still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Mileshovice.
Here too you will have to use snowflakes to clean snowflakes.
When they become portable again, they cannot be estimated until now.
In the region of Hodonín, caution is given in the area of white carpathine.
On the streets, which can only be scattered with inert currents for reasons of nature protection, there is a thick snow cover up to five centimeters, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of neuschnee fell, most in northern trees - up to 18 centimeters.
Up to 15 centimeters of neuschnee fell in the Hungarian-Schlesian region.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops cutting slowly.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The U.S. troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which has so far been known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban and shift the force ratio to their advantage.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Their missiles are directed to the target by laser with only a few meters of meeting safety.
The special shafts of Caliber 25 mm designed for this weapon and containing high-explosive explosives work practically like small grenades.
The bulkheads can be programmed so that they can explode at any point not only when they hit the target but at any point of their ballistic flight.
That means you can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the grave.
He is usually not protected from the top, so the killer steel splitter from the top can easily put him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new weapon of combat is the first infantry weapon to make use of "intellectual" technologies.
"The soldier basically goes as follows: he looks at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins an exact point of view after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he just needs to subtract.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you press the gun, you launch the gun and shoot the gun at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu Group moved its branch to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year 400 employees will be transferred to Astro Park from the former office building at Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is moving to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
As the industry industry industry specialising in computer and maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be transferred to Astro Park in July next year from the former office building at Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg, which is a large office complex on the Lyoner Straße in the Lower Rad district of Frankfurt.
One of Fujitsu's speakers explained that in the medium term there should still be 100 more jobs in the Group that have been allocated to the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park are better off against the employee's working methods.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was also only a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new transfer of an important company within the region called for yesterday's joy in the winners and disappointment in the losers.
The Frankfurter Economics Senator Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" was once again won.
That was a "great local recognition".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for low-wheel.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"We have, of course, offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Square.
Finally, economic reasons would have given rise.
Now it is about preventing a long gap in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building are cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the Town Hall and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects in the city of Kurstadt, with the other buildings at the Marienbader Square ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new urban tree was created between the railway station and the Town Hall, which provided both the massive construction of the areas used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and then the computer manufacturer Fujitsu connected with Siemens, also referred to the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu Consortium, located in Tokyo, is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, much more employees, however, Fujitsu is located in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, Fujitsu Technology Solutions is located in Frankfurt-Niederrad, where the other subsidiaries are intended to be Fujitsu services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, the Astro Park office building was rented 7000 square metres.
In the twenty-year old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped base - the central association of electrical engineering and electronics industry has its seat.
Amazon Block Server - Threats to Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange reportedly stands in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is increasingly under attack in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's watchlists, is to be held after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks pressed by Amazon server."
"Free Speech in the Land of the Fries," the disclosure activists shared with Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists had withdrawn from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to manage the high number of access to documents when secret diplomatic expenses were published.
On Twitter Wikileaks continued on the step: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
When Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its server through Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had hired research, the TV broadcaster CNN reported on the office Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Affairs threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I wish Amazon had taken this action earlier in view of the previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to refuse to use servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unforgivable and reckless action puts our national security at stake and endangers the world's life," says a statement by the Partisan Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, sought by the authorities in Sweden for rape, is on Interpol's list.
After a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in the United Kingdom, the exact place is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as the intruder of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesperson Christian Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange was afraid of his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks disclosures be charged and set up for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to government chief Stephen Harper said - apparently ironic - on television, assanges should be "killed" and Obama could "use a threat".
Between the White House and Assange, then a coup d'état started.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "laughing and absurd," that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for recently known spying orders to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website."
The U.S. government is now making extensive testing of the protection of its databases.
As Special Representative, Russell Travers, was appointed Vice-Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Action, the White House.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that have become necessary after the publication of the messages by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that they should be in danger from the Wikileaks publication to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists.
"We've done everything we can to contact them," said Foreign Secretary Philip Crowley.
"We are willing to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice counters are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest tour and visitors from around the world.
Where does the whole ice actually come from?
From the glacier and from the gelataio.
The gelatine, in German, somewhat old-fashioned of the ice counter, presents the cream according to all the rules of the Italian icemaker's art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator with a bowl, puts it into the waffle and then sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, he doesn't come to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice creams from its machines are corrected everywhere for the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest tour and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses around chocolate and practice in the home ice cream.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply ride on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the future in the country of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate consultant and wants to do something of his own in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an iceberg in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Galtiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
It is crucial not only to taste good, but also to taste good and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the superstition of the national and even southern building: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then every amount of romance is involved."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano boils the ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up a pot on the machine and out comes a pasteurized white bass cream, the basis for all types of milk.
Immediately the lecturer will be confronted with questions: Can ice cream be produced only with natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can you let your own taste of experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being led by the spirit of time into error.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guarbohn flour.
Of course you can make ice without a stabilizer, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will be packed together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are permitted.
It'll be more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste of ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients purchased in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pasta.
"The suppliers will all try to convert dozens of aromatized additives to you."
"But you should just experiment."
Both in the fruit sorbates with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even at the ice cream from the white base mass, which will be with eggs for yellow cream and with cocoa powder on the basis of all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also be applied to fruit varieties.
More flavors, more fruit purée - tastefully this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice is not necessarily more nuisance when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice is the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture will bring the taste of a gelato right out, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: If Pfrich-Puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extraportion of sugar is required for lemoneis.
Luciano extracts a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Luckily, tables make computers easier.
Ice making doesn't require as much physical action as before.
Not only helps the device for the automatic manufacture of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is applied creamy at the same time and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation for spite do not remain small pans.
The Brazilian Gustavo climbs up and down with fruit purée, when the over-dimensional staff mixer takes him out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time until something like that happens."
Checked (optional)
The European Food Authority (EFSA) has been submerged by the industry experimenting with herbivorous plants.
This project is now being formulated by the expert group Test Biotech, which is understood as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Test Biotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA Expert Group on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been working closely with the EFSA test rules for herbaceous plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The EFSA regulations are, by way of derogation, identical to the position papers of the Ilsi and therefore carry the industrial handwriting to be controlled by the Italian Parma.
It's already the second time that test biotech has a conflict of interest.
Thus, a high-ranking manager of Efsa has recently become a Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any orders or transitional period - and has thus changed the pages.
The Central German Radio (MDR) had recently revealed personal links between the EU's controlling authority and industrial lobbying, which has made the Environment Agency as clear as EU Parliamentings.
However, the EFSA cannot identify any conflict of interest.
All serious data are collected, including those of industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it is said in an opinion.
The experts who work for Efsa do not require that they have no contact with the industry.
But they had to reveal them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This is itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including the risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying order.
In this case, independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any animal feeding test and that the reaction of plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what makes, for example, genetically modified corn on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole plant, which does not deliver reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" Then, the defendant.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technische Hochschule Zurich.
Industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as in the United States.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who have not been cursed with groups.
Critical studies would not normally be published for companies.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also taken care of a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday night he stood in the shape of Stuttgart Railway Station, the Tuba on his back.
It was a demon.
It's cut.
The story is known: In September the Baggers were set up and began to break off a large part of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: thousands of Roma protested against S21, the billion-thousand undergroundization of the train station.
When it came to the buildingtop, most of the bird was in the trümmern.
Broken in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft solid stone, intertwined between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Eastfields, 43 years old.
He's got a few of the pants.
"These stones are Reliquien."
"They must not disappear."
He whispers, "A cheaper and poorer stone, simple and earthy."
When he quit, he smoked after cigarette qualm.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with his pants.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all the guys who went to Stuttgart at the abbreviation.
"It would be a shame if they would be ground to fire or disappear in the depot," he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was shy and threatened, he tells when he was in the papers in September that he bought the rest of the northern wing of the destroyer.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he can't do anything for the abbreviation.
And if it happens once, then it is the most sensible thing if the stones were to be used again.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos of heavy squares, a piece price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some, but also in the hope of being able to return it when a reconstruction takes place.
500 tons had bought Rongs, 25 large trucks.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and had pulled away what they could carry luggage and trailers.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long turned into "müerle" or into limits of herbs.
"Indeed, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He rides in his earthly car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great empire.
Jura studied and broke down, later biology, then he was interested in computer and eventually became a stone dealer.
And a stone lover.
40000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany, he collects his treasures.
He says he's the largest old-fashioned dealer in the Republic.
It's braked.
In the snow there are artificially preserved sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, it's hot.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the road through the forest.
He shows on a hill: red sandstein, former part of the Karlsruher station.
And so on.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once the square belonged to the tribe of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, cannstat Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbroner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongs think about how the stones were held by hand before and moved with simple tows and oxencarts, they will be quite aweful.
"It would be a scandal if you were to do something like that."
He didn't become rich, he didn't even become rich.
But 14 people are busy today, and also in the forest the stonesmith, a sculptor, asmith, a glassblower and a gardener have left.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the translator.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also rocks to save.
Talent struggle for high potentials
There's a real Andang in the buffet.
16 Students are anxious about salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen invited the machine building and design students to a workshop.
In some form of idea competition, they are expected to learn about the car of the future, together with VW developers – and in addition to the Volkswagen.
In the race for the smartest heads, many companies are now in the immediate battle and, like VW, are putting on cooperation with universities.
Your mission: Recruit the best graduates as early as possible in the audiences before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not issue statements about the performance of their students, you try to master the exceptional talents in practical projects and tie up.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group is selling the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball pens, rubber sheets and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful youth of practical programs and students' jobs and shows them ways to the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig is managing the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with industry and gather experiences."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look at interesting candidates more closely and think about who is in question as an employee."
Such cooperations, such as Cells, are not unusual.
Newly, it'll be so offensive to the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates is likely to get even harder.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to select their employees from a large number of applicants.
In particular, they need to be commended and especially targeted by highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering plants remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even greater, according to VDI forecasts.
For KPMG, Roman Dykta is going to the talent hunt.
It organises intensive recruitment events such as KPMG Race, a kind of modern cutting hunt, where participants must find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States in the next year.
In addition, participants can see KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Anyone who has the right to choose in two rounds of selection in the foreground.
Only the Creme de la Creme of many applicants fly to the United States.
During the hooves and strikes around the High Potentials at the universities, the shields are increasing according to Dykta.
"We want to get out of the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing session was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta seems to be up to date.
"To this day, we have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are just ahead of their end and want to apply for us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct boom at the campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go to the Pirsch in professional trade fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Sometimes on the intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, staff leader at Solarworld's solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonner Company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stube knows about the issue of adolescence.
Currently 35 posts are posted on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy casual positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the Uni professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors indicate that we can practice or write our diplomas."
Dear advertising events are not recommended for solar specialists.
The company tries to promote itself with other advantages: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"That can't often be offered by a large group," says Staff Manager Stube.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld presented the 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff leader Stübe also hopes to place additional points with the job seekers.
"I think that applicants are looking especially for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advised his customers about more authenticity.
And that means, according to warlords, most of all internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as an employer leads through its own employees," he says.
In the industry jargon is called the Internal Employer Branding, i.e. employers' branding within your own team.
"Filled employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify themselves with the company, they would be absolutely alone with friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"It's like a band game," says Kriegler.
Obama shuts down new oil wells
Before the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico there will be no new oil wells in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been passed by the government in Washington - thus ultimately withdrawing its earlier plans.
Even before the Atlantic Coast, new boreholes are first forbidden.
This was shared by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
A trigger for the strict ban to apply at least for the next five years is the explosion of the dive platform "deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico to be carried out under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The sponsors want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil deliveries from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the vengeful olive oil in the Gulf have not been fully declared to this day.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A committee of inquiry on behalf of Obama is to present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop that was suspended after the explosion.
Following this, different oil groups had also submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which has been involved in numerous corruption projects, is fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced closing lucative tax slots for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now warning the public that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by means of stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brakes for the growth of the oil and gas industry," says the result of a current industry survey by the consultant firm BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be delayed until further notice - the burden of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is olive-brown, it smells like at the tank station: billions of litres of oil leaked out have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoni.
People live by theft, corruption and illegal cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means it's good.
"Don't worry," the Eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge before the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been trying to unlighten a boy up to his chest in the water with the veils around him: In the rainbow-colored water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
The fact that brown crude oil spews beneath the surface is not visible.
Earlier, she had collected yarns here, says Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the river is completely dead.
Five years ago, a brushed tube pipe went into the huge wet area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now need to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: the Ogoniland located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the worst devastated regions in the world.
The whole extent of the destruction is evident on the road through the mangroves that flow through the rivers.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat breeds brown bridges, and whoever dips his hand in the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees say like black lactating rods from the ground, sadly let the individual palms hang their branches.
Bird fever, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, is ignored: As soon as the outer borders cease, splendour is spread in the former paradise that smells like a tank.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is applied.
Ogoni's settlement area has been a battlefield that has been fought for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe entered here, organized here in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa of the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to stop its production because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still denied the return to Ogoniland: while from the entire delta of the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling springs and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines are pumped daily more than two million pieces of black gold, the oil fields are broken in Ogoniland, too unstable for the group is the situation.
All a few hundred meters say ironlike statues like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christ trees" are called the heads of the holes too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Such a drilling head breaks again and again, according to Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres are flown into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years according to expert estimates: year by year the amount of oil, as it went into the sea in front of Alaska 21 years ago in the case of the "Exxon Valdez" super tanker's adventure - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the continued eco-GAU will be challenged.
During the Shell Group Sabotage and the organised oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution is responsible, environmental protectionists see drilling heads and leak pipelines as the main cause.
Shell is a much lower safety standard in Nigeria than in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner presented to the Group in 2008: Only the rate of defects on the lines is "about a fold higher than elsewhere".
At a place that looks from far away like a deserted, oil-smelling workshop under free sky, the mangrove shapes appear: they are split and oil-smelling up to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels that are partially connected to pipes, partially distributed on the ground, a fire is flashing: an illegal small refinery.
In the facade, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group’s leader.
First, petrol penetrates into the cap through the tube, then drips at the end of the Kerosin line and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel at 300 liters daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The price of barely 40 Euro-cent per litre ridiculously low diesel can still be charged to the illegal cooks: because their raw material gets them unsanitary.
It comes from "Bunkers", which take over the pipeline network through Ogoniland: This way, experts throughout Niger lose at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day.
However, only a small part of the cached raw material is illegally processed: the lion's share is filled with organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, in tank ships, and is being wrecked on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is due more to the revolutions of the population or the salmon production method is due to the activist Akpobari's purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had not destroyed the fishermen's living conditions so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, the Ogoni relationship has been destroyed especially to Shell, so that only one withdrawal of the group is in question: "Perhaps other nationalities such as the Chinese are better off."
That's where Michael gets nervous.
"The highest time that you disappear," says the muscley eelman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil processors are captured by the special unit of the fighting forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful but painful bribe.
The soldiers primarily coming from the state-north want to benefit from the raw material, as do all Nigerians.
"This damn witness has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Detector detects dangerous buffing inhibitors in A380 engines
The A380 appears to have a major security problem.
In the investigation of a non-tertiary machine, researchers have discovered a possible blowhole that could lead to a "catastrophic car failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to report to the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the not-land Qantas-Airbus in early November apparently had much more luck than they had in the past: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns against a possible blowhole.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: If an oil pipeline connection could produce fatigue and leaks, it was called ATSB's opinion published on Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic car accident".
They were manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to settle in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It provided a plea in law at an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, enabling it to take further legal measures against the company.
Quantas-Chief Alan Joyce said his airline would require damages for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, parts had been dissolved and the bearing surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire a cause of damage.
In the meantime, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that further safety tests should be carried out on the superjumbos equipped with the affected vehicles.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan said.
The security problem has been considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its 11 A380 on the ground.
The Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-stocked aircraft is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
Landwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Over the night snow has fallen almost all over the country.
On many streets chaos, trains and flights fall.
In the case of car accidents, at least three people died.
The winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic is added to the night on Thursday - which leads to much traffic chaos.
In the north and the east there are partially 15 centimeters thick snow cover.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in permanent use, but was not finished with the constantly rising snow.
In addition, the eastern sea coast was covered by strong waves.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expected at the east coast of Schleswig-Holsteins from the morning to storm currents with 1.2 metres of water standing above normal.
In Saxony, snow travel on highways and roads led to significant problems.
According to the weather-centered meteoroid, the alarm level was therefore violet in the Sächschen Switzerland - the highest level at all.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters of snow, fresh and strong winds provided for openings.
There were several trucks and cars stuck there during the night.
Even in Sachsen-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stowing traffic and steam.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by snow.
According to German Railway, significant disturbances occur in Saxony, Sachsen-Anhalt, Thuringia and in northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or damaged lines and softs are the main problems.
In Saxony, the transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescue helpers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snowwinds huddled over the streets.
On large German airports, the snow wind leads to numerous air accidents.
According to a spokesperson in Munich, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport speaker.
The winter service is in permanent use.
Although only a few beached passengers are at the airport, they still have almost 400 field beds.
On many streets there were accidents already in the middle of the afternoon.
In the evening, a truck driver came to death with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred due to snow-covered roads: a truck was picked up here on a train crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed the street with her car at Ascharchenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore will be shaken with light waves.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is visited by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - instead up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its trademark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property in.
The German Bank has only made its own company attractive: the twin towers in Frankfurt Bankenvirtel have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have been allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial group wants to recover the costs for the renovation - and looks for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" calls for a speaker.
Reasons for the planned sale were not called by the speaker.
"We always check if it makes sense to own or sell property itself and then rent it back," he said.
Thus, Germany's largest credit institution will rescind its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The Bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investors of a home-owned fund and then carefully repaired them.
The energy conversion went down to about EUR 200 million.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers of the newspaper, which have been renamed "Greentowers", by about EUR 500 million.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, whether it is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands of tears around a whole buddy
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the hidden mountain ranges, which were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be secured because the security situation in the accident is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago there was an explosion in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 mining workers between the ages of 17 and 62 were displaced under the age of 17.
A probe had been left in the accident box, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer a chance for the friend.
The bodies could not be secured until now.
Now relatives and friends remembered with a memorial to the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered on the New Zealand South Island in a radiant sunset in Greymouth.
They've been silent for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered mountains there were 29 tables, on which were lamps, lamps, and the names of the palate.
Pictures and personal items, including pieces of clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags weighed about half a mile.
New Zealand hoped that the mountain ranges would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said New Zealand Minister John Key to the Memorial participants.
"But they never came home."
He couldn't finish with his son's death until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' members, several foreign diplomats attended the Memorial.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African mountain ranges were also hidden.
Rescue workers began to wipe out a fire inside the coal mine on the island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are forced, it will start to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
Go to hell, warrior!
Does the splatter fit into the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is re-locating his old genre boundaries with his "Walhalla Rising" epos.
What audience may the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he turned "Wallala Rising"?
A prisoner Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his tormentors and is facing his foes with almost superhuman forces, especially - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and his enemies are already distraught from the living body when he has bad pay.
On the other hand, Inauge says, as he is actually called, that the whole film is not about a word, and also the other figures are able to add up to one or two sentences or a few qualms of death.
Otherwise, it will be swallowed and swallowed in the gruesomely beautiful hillland of Scotland, which the Viking world offers the cult of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult filmmakers with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Well, if a movie has several target groups, it only hurts if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn is considered "Pusher" since his wild and gifted drug-aler trilogy as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stubbornly refuses to make his works with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art-kino friends were allowed to be terrified by the spraying mass of the brain and the intestines.
The action fans die long ago, when insights for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries break up through ships to Jerusalem and establish an eternity in the flood and fog before the crew appears to arrive in America and remain there silent.
No wonder that "Wallala Rising" in Germany did not find any cinema rental and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially because of the beautiful pictures a pity, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade a occasionally exciting piece of cinema has earned some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogue or a strict action, it's all about atmosphere, a movie dream.
And there's no way out of it for the viewer.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and cuts him with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack quite slowly to the throat, but especially with the inconceivable hatred that beats him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blond boy, who is loyal to the eye, keeps something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero, whose motive is never explained, but who, for enemies and temporarily, will ever become a warrior from hell, perhaps a messenger of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for those who have been destroyed anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a gruesome movie that you can hate and admire for anger, excitement and stauns.
An experience.
Earthwork in motion
The IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country agrees to take a stand - it still allows for controls.
At least four Israeli F-15 I combat aircraft attack a mysterious, warp-shaped building in Syria at midnight on 6 September 2007.
It is on the shore of the Euphrates; the next largest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria has allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the framework, hidden in a valley that flows away from the power.
According to a letter from the CIA's U.S. Foreign Intelligence Service at the end of April 2008, the reactor running under the name of the nearby town of el Kibar would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, the technology hardly emerges from the 50s.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with unscathed satellite images.
By computer animation, it blended into which components of the reactor should have been before destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
She also presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was just before the launch, but it was not yet equipped with fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it's hardly known more than then, yes the puzzles have grown bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el Kibar, but hardly saw any signs of "an active nuclear programme" in the country.
Some secret agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious and speak only of a "probably reactor", even though they hold the CIA presentation as "plausible".
You have no hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat answered only Lapidar in summer, which the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The said "unused military building" was protected by the Syrians, but the Syrians were on the other side and were planning the land thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinone in el Kibar traces of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received, via a Member State, satellite images of commercial operators from time to time after the attack which should be more pronounced than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings cannot be obtained on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always insisted that it never operate a secret nuclear program or build a reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
However, this was demonstrated by the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
The inspectors are also denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the tunnels of the bombed building.
But Israel also ceases to iron.
"We will never comment on this," recently Prime Minister Ehud Olmert confirmed the official position at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "is becoming increasingly a serious issue of credibility for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat at IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - finally a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon agreement in the area over which the IAEA is awaiting.
As a key to progress in the clarification, the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions "in a functional connection" with the expected reactor - and other than this one still exists.
Until now, the inspectors have not revealed which plants they are dealing with, what functions they have, or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandaryah internally at the IAEA and are derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and found a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this justification Syria of the IAEA denies access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the United States to drain military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that the material has been transported back and forth between the three sites and the framework at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and from which the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated, there are at least plausible suspicions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether drums that could mount valuable tracks were stored in three places.
If the hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the ground, no one wanted to know where the shield remained.
The Salzmine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has examined on its suitability for radioactive waste in 1998, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently contacted the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, recordings from the Orbit show that Syria took over at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly contributed to eradicating the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop an inspection plan there which should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - only shows the effort that is of great interest to the inspectors.
India, Damascus has also adopted this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had been depressed a year ago, the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter has not been of high urgency, some US ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the strongest means that the Vienna nuclear power has to carry out controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still slowing down.
There is a high risk in this way: For one thing, there is a need for a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are everything but an escalation.
To others, how to think about a diplomat: "What if they don't find anything at all?"
Love in the Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started work in the summer at her still unnamed bus stop, there are problems.
She wrote her own book, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, is that during the Yugoslav war, she fell in love with her Serbian rapist.
Bosniak women's associations immediately protested, after which some of the rotations planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female victims of war wrote about the UN Refugee Relief Agency UNHCR to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper reported now - Jolie herself is the ambassador of the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she has already offered the women a meeting in Hungary a week ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims betrays her enough about the book.
Her organization has recommended to the UN Relief and Works Agency to release Jolie as a ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But exactly what did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given her book to read, has granted her permission for Sarajevo after a while - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself claims that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis runs on the film in the web, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew about it before the war broke out and met again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds a lot different than the "victim of rape" version of torture.
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so safe.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only get Hollywood peace hackers: By putting the spinbook, like so many before, into the net illegally.
Nothing like gone here.
This evening, it finally goes right back around for the Irish.
No sign of distress.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans dress in front of joy at cracking loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey-Pub is located in the Southern Cork because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet them.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre show to win there is 500 Euro win tickets to Las Vegas for the world Cup in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the withholding computerist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself to get away from the overwhelming question that will bring the future.
On his plan he does not have fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mummy feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still don't have a job there."
Meanwhile, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had back, sucked her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and laughs.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the danners, it looks like it is on the island in many families.
100 000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts at the ESRI Institute for Economic and Social Research in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they will even have 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of migration comparable to that of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity to the Irish people, it is now again becoming a source of sorrow.
The economic crisis assures, above all, the young well-educated Irish people, for which it has only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, there was money in the flood.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are also letters of reading of young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one will make the light go out."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future coming up because the government only operates eyelids and gives young people no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have a strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her compilitons hang from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate themselves in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to get the issue straight.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a roundabout service on the topic of work abroad.
"For starters, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something somewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're just pulling up a fashion house.
In January it goes further to Hannover or Berlin, for the next project.
His home sees O'Donovan only rarely now, because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when he first falls over the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as ever."
He laughs at something and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-maintained suburbs, in the entrance parks large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent of the credit.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
He's afraid that it might be a mess with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, throws some hot tea and says, "I don't have kids that I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over again."
The construction engineer doesn't like the webbing he hears at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back there and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just look at how it goes with life everywhere.
A few years' work in London has already been behind him, and why shouldn't it also run well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
But there is still one thing that bothers him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid it might look like a lifetime party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says and drinks a great blow from his beer.
"Well, that sounds scary."
"We prefer to call it a road party, quite casual, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The movement of democracy in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results included the Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's survey of September and October.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has risen significantly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong break-in last year, such a trend is to be recognized.
However, only half of the people surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Figure 2).
Some 44% of the respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. These are as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% or 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts to increase democracy.
The fact that this also took place during the world economic crisis may be that the countries of Latin America have experienced only a short recession and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly and 32% again this year.)
But from country to country there are strong mood differences (see Figure 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the separate president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in widespread progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where recession was more sensitive and crimes of violence have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the beginning of the survey do many in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been the victim of a crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year, the values have fallen and have thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: around 71% of respondents over-regionally reported that the private economy was indispensable for development, 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has made many private companies public.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, surveyors in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A spin button
No one expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28th.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the electorate, who were leading to help the oppressed country, far beyond that.
Overcrowded polls, multiple votes cast, ballots in the Rhinestone, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
The hall was opened with an hourly delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, searched all around for an option.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged top riders, demanded the abolition of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There have been some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "very well in many interests".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "make these irregularities, as seriously as they may be, the process does not necessarily invalidate".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly obliged to the unpopular separate president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected sample selection is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial plea for invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent amongst the voters, explains from the electoral authority to the winner of the strike election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million Earthquake victims still live in tents, a small number of elections were feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by a lack of organisation from voting.
Shortly before the election began, about 250,000 evidence needed for the election had not yet been distributed.
It's a lot at stake.
The donor countries considered a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Homely in the middle
In the weeks following your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate up to over 50% above. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you help this in a re-election next year depends on whether the apparently sad Cristina Fernández is compromise manager than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who, even after his wife's election, guided economic policy, often drew up budgetary plans that did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President's couple to spend extra income at their own expense.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition was divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further rejection.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the reigning Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian faced another and others visited the government of bribery), the Congress was unable to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss it," said the president.
The 2010 budget is also applicable for the next year, which gives the President an even more opportunity to spend money on his own good thoughts.
The economy is hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage requirements of trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was shielded from economic crises, explained growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, not inflation decline.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, ridiculed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute for Statistics and Population Indec, which then adorned official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate course now?
She called the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth gap by a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps Cristina Fernández wants to join the rest of the world financially for this reason.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had refused to repay the country in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing into an agreement with the money donors from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The churches had always refused a check by the IMF, as is the case elsewhere.
Last month, however, Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" when creating a new national consumer price index. It seems that this would be the first step towards cleaning the INDIC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, she needs the support of the middle layer, which most has enough of the church.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy they have been overcome will be lost.
If she wants to win another election, she must decide whether to withdraw many political decisions from her husband in silence.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan hold from his great brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, who are 70% of all eligible to elect mayors and mayors in the five urban districts, were elected. This is assessed as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of the relationship to the mainland. Her policy has changed the relationship to the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) appoints three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Party of Progress (DPP), which advocated greater independence in Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the city hall together with the KMT.
During the election it came to the usual appearances in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with tiemakers, flag-swinging mass trains and only sloppy dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the honorary president of the KMT, gave a speech on a KMT candidate on the election evening,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, he was wounded, and a man of the surrounding eyes was killed.
Bizarre is not clear whether the protection officer wanted to kill the line or to face a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and turned the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has protected more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Notably, relations with the mainland have not been discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like its relations with the government in Beijing.
This time, however, the DPP also avoids much noiseing the anti-Chinese feelings.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, on the other hand, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese advocate their Chinese policies.
The Government of Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan with economic incentives into the Community.
China immediately sent a contractor to Taipei to prepare a summit for investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but first of all.
This is why it prefers to wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago she was very weak: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he made a strong commitment to absolute independence.
But under Tai's regentience, a new generation of politicians developed and the DPP was fighting for the voices of professionals and young people.
As a presidential candidate for the DPP, Tsai was given great approval, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that it is also able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea project as a contact point between DPP and China. However, this presupposes unfavourable discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that its party offers a "confidential alternative" to mass faster approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP candidates would have done better to be independent on Taiwan.
He even called on Pragmatic Su to give up the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's involvement, the DPP makes it difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election without it.
The main reasons for his unwelcomeness seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scarcity between arm and kingdom.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a limited re-negotiation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return".
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was nominated mainly for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding is already a celebrated star since its 2008 album "Esperanza" in the Jazz scene, the nomination seems a bit unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at least three albums before the album was released, with which he was known in the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her shuffled voice and a good sense of pop, fun and Latin music, you can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination Spaldings.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated as instrument albums in the category of instrument albums.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboard John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a stolen favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where other albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Society of the Wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of Big Group. He is thus acting against the Billy Children Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablam "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra is listed with five voices, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and was launched in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestras, operas, choirs to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, Bergs "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphonie Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt für Symphonie No. 4, Daugherty für "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze für "Appassionatente Plus", Magnus Lindberg für "Graffiti" and Shchedrin für "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärts Symphony No. 4 was recorded and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by L.A. Philharmonics led by Esa-Pekka Salons.
The approximately 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concert" received a nomination in the instrumentalsolo category with orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the Mandoline Artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestra for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, Geiger Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumentalists.
Only women were nominated as vocalists this year, including Anne Sophie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measa Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, Soprano Jesse Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moscow in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found, after a five-hour, often hot public hearing, the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics proposed the project to promote both terrorism and traffic.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new centre of religion is in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic perspective.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, while the votes on both sides were distributed fairly evenly according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the web page of the paper.
"There's no America anymore," one said.
"It is another planet of the monkey, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
Its municipality with approximately 135 families has lived peacefully in the Riverside County for years. However, they wanted a larger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a water filter manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minerals and become about 13m high.
It is intended to take place on the 17.500 m2 large property at Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange type of bacteria that can live, among other things, by arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements considered vital so far.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"That makes it quite special, although it is almost a 'foreign' form of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as scientists discovered, the bacteria in the Californian Mono Lake continue to grow when it is replaced by arsenic.
"There you wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, so to speak.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details were disclosed about the discovery caused too much speculation on the Internet that the report could act as an discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms with the help of other elements biochemical processes can be put in place and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily identified," explained Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at Milton Keynes's Open University in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," said Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, they assume that microbes that are both exposed may be able to replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly based on the chemical behavior of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It reaches into our biochemical system, where it almost all stinks," says Anbar.
The researchers discontinued the GFAJ-1 bacterium from an increasing arsenic concentration.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there has not been a functioning example.
Arsen appeared more often in the early years, she says, so science has come to the conclusion that early life forms have used it.
"There is reason to assume that life may have developed differently than in the early times of the earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research work was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown to the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were subjected before a Bellflower Motel 6 night, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two of them on Wednesday evening, says Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are good," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide detailed information on the location of the dogs to the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still underway."
"We don't want to say that anymore," Whitmore explains.
"We're following some leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs to a district school in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's representatives found the delivery car and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rude, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were unharmed according to government statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city, because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the pair from Dogschau to Dogschau.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stayed in motels and park their delivery car in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer wolf, a parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany - with their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder's reward. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet possible to determine whether a finder's salary would be paid.
The lion re-embarks after judicial approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally received green light for a fresh start.
On Thursday, a New York Competition Manager officially approved the "prepared" credit plan to pay $5 billion in debt and open the way for new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday's statement, the plan meets the requirements of US competition law, so that the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in progress. Barber and Birnbaum will be presented to the somewhat speculative studio as the head of business.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually only enters into force when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM products.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which owns $75 million, will run the company. The funding should be up to mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the commission of the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, who struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve its financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who was known for his activities at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve MGM's financial concerns and to pay off more than 140 creditors of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company at the end of 2009.
However, the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In spring this year, everything started in advance when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially passed the competition in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 per month for the management of the company, receives a $4 million "successful bonus".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio produced only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio also needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films to be produced under Peter Jackson's direction.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not produce any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can travel a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jump lines or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can clear your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholeesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost a little less than last year.
And although less new toys appear with their own website, one of the most famous of these types, webkinz and Club Penguin, is a wider offer.
More and more button-cell-operated toys are on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plush figures, as large as sea pigs, who sing a note when you press on their belly.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, you can play a song by multiple pressing.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: If you start with the pressure once, you can't stop.
For a combination of shipping and dancing, the Dance Star Mickey (fisher-price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatorian doll offers switching games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new carnival feet with wheel-blocking it dominates the Moon-Walk.
Children who test the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playscool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole series of questionnaires with which a car ride can become a teaching hour, with a better idea with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qvaluey keyboard. However, the games included are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system like iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a striped wooden box and have a own LED screen.
The game is about to combine the blocks to words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised letter competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go only after the offer in the toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at the Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive sufficient credits for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
These can be roller shoes or a puffle animal.
The latest head cell-operated microbot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The chauffeur moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone bees in any direction.
It's fun to send him out of a mess.
And he's holding on to something.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even spent some time in the mud of our dog.
Police intervention in China is becoming more flexible
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked over a city square, checked his nerves and issued military authority and depressed voice commands.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust city order guards, afraid and despised for their arbitrary raids and their hanging on violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand right there!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing up at teen age, stood tight with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four regular hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white loops.
"They look to me on average," says Mr. Tang.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of Chinese city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The Guangdong province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the greys.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-strength: According to 2009 reports, 50 officers ran a misdesigned Imbiswag and stared at the operator until he packed up and left the room after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police forces. They have been specially selected because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the gross police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, however, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are allowed to enforce urban laws only through fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media show a different picture on a regular basis.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei saw an observer die when he filmed her with his phone as they shot a protest station against a garbage dump.
Last year a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published online. It describes how criminals can be beaten without blood.
This year a Shanghai water melon dealer suffers from a handful of brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chenguguan fears the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over tactics.
The paper called for "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics find the current approach clearly insufficient.
When the district looked for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real jobs or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the position, women between the ages of 18 and 22 were sought with good figures and "harmonic facial features".
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too hard physically.
"The most important thing is her image," said an anonymous district officer at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"If the candidates get the job, it depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "within qualities".
"Women's Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other obligations".
Zheng Lihua, Vice-President of the City Administration of the District, does not wish to make this description binding,
but admitted that in China size standards in job advertisements for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether to be equal to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use mud or buffling here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cakes and a well formed mouth.
She didn't feel like sexist that she was so much valued.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the miners, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to your data, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply checking out traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strips deal with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are pursued.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have already told you so often!" explains Frl. Xu, a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle.
According to officials, the activity is rather monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost the same every day," says Huang Jing, 20, who studies distribution in leisure.
"All the routines."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, as their male colleagues do.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This should protect them from public hostility, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year hundreds of people from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, ran the rumor that Chengguan officials would have killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officers were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown or burned in fire.
Xindu has been spared such violence so far.
But worry is not to be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baongang Square, where women's officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute delay, the officers marched on their vehicles with a cruel face and drove on with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male stripe, stayed back. He turned his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li.
"Most of the time people start the fight."
State Prosecutor Not Accused Senator Ensign
Senator John Ensign was acquitted by state lawyers of the Ministry of Justice, who, after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to provide his spouse with a lobbying activity, were raised against him, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most difficult draft law against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that led to beating lines across the country and his career moved a damper, he was considered a potential presidential candidate for the Republican for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's Office announced, he was "very pleased" about the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the ethics committee of the Senate could impose another discipline.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were suspended and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that ensign has ignored the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first published in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his constituents, had helped him to make lucid orders to buy his silence over a business with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasurer during a campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide work for Hampton. According to the papers and interviews, he took over for them after setting up Hampton's lobby work.
As Hampton was recently in the Ensigns election team, he was not allowed to take up any lobby work for a year for his former employer or the whole Senate.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, was against the so-called ban on rotational lobbying.
According to published India, "everything seems to be about an agreement and the violation against the rotating states," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in government vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Ministry appeared to be very cautious in recording political charges after a number of losses suffered by the media with great interest, including the last year's decision to drop the charge against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Public prosecutors "are obviously scary," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim is to combat corruption in the U.S. parliamentary and governmental circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received a telephone call from a state attorney on Monday and another day on the next day when he was informed that the ministry would not bring complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns' defenders had cooperated with the state prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law".
Mr Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had put forward against the public prosecutors.
"I don't think I'm going to go to the details of the discussion between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much has it been said: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to put in place investigations for a separate complaint by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents violated the Hamptons against the Federal Elections Act.
The electoral commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton's company moved on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "attacking" at the Ministry of the Interior.
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, who had made an arrangement for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had set up a lobby job.
For the first time in the past year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been in fourth place in the ranks of the Republicans.
After he had been gone for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign was no longer the goal of police investigations, his press spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator, said he hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and stop his investigations.
" Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire-Using Pays Attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were stuck in the Krawales in the courtroom.
In a minute, they posted their reports on cruel testimony on Twitter.
At the end of the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape and bed-chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the death sentence issued by the jury falls.
However, Mr Hayes' lawyers have already submitted applications to the Court of Justice for reasons of appeal and for the courts to be employed for years.
One of the most challenging reasons is that it has been through the intensive reporting of the process - including through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "circumstance" and a so widespread, immediate passage of upheaval details, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public turmoil.
This objection could lead the appeals court to deal with the question of whether new technologies will require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe it is a real danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Chief Defender, Mr. Hayes.
The President, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, last week showed the applications by decision short and ally when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled", and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, it has been found that the report on famous-known cases has raised doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic judgment of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the judgement against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath of Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the television series and the movie "On the Flight" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that the court's objections, which Mr Hayes considered a half century later, could follow the argument that new rules had become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes being pursued by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals courts might be fascinated by the idea that limiting an immediate communication from the courtroom could make the proceedings fairer.
The Twitter affair is just one of many who represent Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss it for years and thus delay a sentence.
The defenders also claimed, for example, that Mr. Hayes could have already been prejudged when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jury members by showing them cruel scenes during the jury selection.
Some of the jury members said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughter, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had filled them with contempt.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge has falsely exchanged a jury that has been a critic of the prosecution, and that he would have illegally put pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jury wasn't isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a verdict they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and that the candidates had been discussed during the election campaign for the Governor's office and for the US Senate.
They argued that the new media had continuously re-evaluated the flames of emotions over the case.
"Such a daily andrang of media pipers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers said, "you haven't lived in New Haven before and perhaps even across the country."
Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more balanced than reports that will be replaced more slowly was a technically hostile view that undermines the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes would require adaptation by courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyers are strengthening this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard's conviction was lifted on the basis of the report and made it clear that the new media needed new rules.
"This case," she wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can Courtiness connect the separation?
After a campaign of chimpanzees and negativity, this week there is little courtiness in Washington.
Is it the omen of a true bilateral cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the summits of the Congress did not bring a break in the major issues with which one had to deal during the so-called Lame Duck session at the end of a period of government in which no decisions were taken.
After all you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial point collection.
At the same time, the public meeting of the President's deficit commission on Wednesday was civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist among the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that obscures the ideological gap that continues to divide the members.
This is hardly enough to claim that it has been a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is called upon, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away.
Finally, the November elections in Washington voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"That is inevitable by choice.
Election creates partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the Lame Duck session, Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and nobody supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise is to be expected with regard to the increase in unemployment, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferential tax cuts for the rich are being made, while they refuse support for the unemployed.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the Lame Duck session and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brooking Institution warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the Lame Duck session" does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even unavoidable.
"After the things that have to be done have been done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the courtiness leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is going on from today to 2012 as a pre-fighting, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the opening up of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters whose education was useful.
How concerned the Republican leaders may also be that they are too high to poker, they know that they have to try to keep their promises to reduce government expenditure and to put health reform outside of force.
These guidelines are already being clearly reflected in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Commission on the deficit, which include a tax reform and the levying of certain taxes, the lifting of the pension age and the reduction of government expenditure.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken up one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own estimates, have so much pressured to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it cannot be ignored anymore.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan for official recommendation and they fight very hard to get even closer to this number.
The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the board, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for play or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when the Republicans of Obama challenge the state budget, taxes and health system, then followed by a phase of greater bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proved that, despite the partisanity of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a pocket gas as in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Anyone convicted of losing will have to change the course and seek compromise.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Partisanity and polarization are now larger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 see as a clear example for a much broader 2012 election.
This is how many Americans welcome the court that is being held this week.
However, it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that continue to separate the two.
Persistent US document portraits Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and gives it part of the bribery and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February the American message in Russia was reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are suppressing high security money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin referred to as "Vertical of Authority" - takes part of the money that moves the leader upwards.
The memo sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
It was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that it would have been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption proposals over years, and he has won numerous insults against such charges.
In September he declared to a Russian television broadcaster when he was asked for a document suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has resulted in surveys.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is unusual that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government to crime has led to some calling it "distorted" and to the conclusion that the government is more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krishna" (a term from the world of the criminal / mafia, meaning literally "dach" or protection), which is extended to the police, State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Attorney General as well as to the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is the Colonel's place."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the regular criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB's money is disbursed by the largest companies and that the police are arresting small business people.
A source, that is, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to obtain protection from the MVD and the FSB (and not from organised crime), as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer asked as before."
The memo notes that, while collecting the money is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business closed very quickly - because of some prejudice.
Medvedev has repeatedly spoken about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of violence, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Worldwide, according to Indem, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154 as a new study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "the least corruption" to "the most corrupt").
The discovery of the memo of the US message, which took place after Moscow late at night, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of the Moscow error, it can also be an opportunity for the cream to claim that one can solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and responded in anger to the disclosure that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and lax walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sring Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, which have developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge capitulation against the government, long-term supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that told the story of Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a UN and Cambodian community court sentenced for the first time a former member of Khmer Rouge than it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the shower, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs increased, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society more difficult.
"There is still denial and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It separates families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, 1.7 million people were estimated to have been executed or died of disease, reprocessing or hunger.
When the Vietnamese collapsed and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the regime's remains and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
They spread here until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok brought the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, when a 1993 peace agreement sponsored by the UN led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move over to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at Dangreek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006, in Phnom Penh prison, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their gems no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the devastating poverty of rural Cambodian chess and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though some of Khmer Rouge's elite officers kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agriculturalology of the regime."
"They grow up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he left 1998 to lead a life as a poor traveler.
"Life under Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also called for concern here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The task of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not stated whether it will be prosecuted in addition to these four cases.
This has contributed little to softening the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on the Chaem, 64 years old, who was district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told officials from the documentation centre of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of forced workers were likely to die.
On a hot evening, from work on the fields in Chaem came back to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun casts a long shadow on the dried grass, the Chaem refused to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
Should the court invite them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Kambodscha lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no persecution, war would be here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do in order to move forward, Chhang Youk said from the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer Times means summing up the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that they can understand everything."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know only a little about Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are reaching for influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangreek mountains, one of the most crowded and dirty roads leads to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Paul Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire.
Noum Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pots' last resting place, where she will spend a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees not to further collect armslike uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with white Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had for years tried to convince Belarus to no longer collect highly enriched uranium and seem to have reached a herd last spring.
However, U.S. government officials told Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements had been concluded with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, approximately 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of Obama's most important results "The Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" from April, which Belarus had excluded.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really thrilled by the fact that they wanted a seat at the nuclear security summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to release their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"How to maintain high-rich uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically armed, and less-rich uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"That's our raw material... we won't make dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in meeting an agreement.
The first start to remove the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily irradiated, official says.
It was loaded into a special suit, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian plant for storage and disposal, official says.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officers by plane.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with most of the money flowing into Belarus's research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and agreed to build trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who is working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Performing Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its stockpiles under the joint agreement by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's gross disregard for human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues is welcome, the United States of America and Belarus announces that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
No objection from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across Spanish state territory to Guantanamo, as shown by a telegram from the U.S.A. Ambassador to Madrid.
This reflects the documents contained by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former deputy government chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being properly monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid for human rights practices in a thousand countries, including Spain, was charged, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Chief of Government admitted that the Council report "has been hit by Zapatero in the absence" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed," so as not to be "unprepared to be surprised," Aguirre per cable reported.
Also former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because they are in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, gave the message in January 2007 that he would not block the right initiative to declassify the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," said the Ambassador after a discussion with the Attorney General.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about " apparent coordination between the Spanish State Attorney and the German State Attorneys" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage discreetly between governments," lamented Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by US Ambassadors and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are madly concerned about their independence and do what they consider appropriate," he instructed his employees to "avoid angry rhetorical comments to let the tension slip."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt the fact that the government of Zapatero's actions of the United States, which could have been interpreted, tolerated or deliberately ignored as human rights violations, will strike capital, even if these disclosures could have a negative effect on the US government," he said.
The child killer said she complained on the Internet about the motherhood's "trouble".
The young woman talked about the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terrorism in a Galician way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this name, which she conducts from a small point of view, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one girlfriend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know her life of love, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony of her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial woman.
She stayed for a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousam, a neighboring town.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearicians to take care of herself in the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of her messages it can be concluded that her love relationship was broken and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and angry because I came to work."
"When I told him, he found it good, but now of course he notices what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to do and let go of what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get an address I can send you to."
She complained, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boys with my mother, I'll get him when I'm back."
In May, she said of her return to her village: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'll only stay there until 19 because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her first-born when everything's okay.
"He will be with whom he must be with me, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with someone other than my mother," a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes it, she assumes that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand he's with me and the place he likes a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the girl."
On 17: memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss by César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto tells me he sent me some videos on the e-mail.
On the 30th, "The boy's fine. He's going to a summer class to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there's one: "He's offering me money."
In the Internet, in anim and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer".
"Terror in the Gallega (Overwrit). "
The last man who lived with her, a crushed hunter, explains having a conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners to Menorca to Palma's provincial prison.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the outcome of the case, "and she did not intend to add to the minor damage."
Before, however, she had stood in the bathroom drinking Caesar's body in a suitcase.
Defence and the Public Prosecutor's Office applied for a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and lost PSC 9
With the results of November 28, the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona could play a crucial role
Following the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - whether or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes reached by this party in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the Catalonian elections.
In this way, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the conversion of the PSC's vote and the binding of the PP's election - should continue, the PP analysts predict that the PSC could rise from 8 to 12 congressional members in the parliamentary elections, while CIU also won four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose at least 9 (of 25) MPs.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MP - at the moment it has three - while ICV could keep or win one of its MPs.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the next date will be the May 2011 elections. Also, the People's Party (PP) may be the language of the wave to prepare an end to the socialist predominance, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor seize their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not clear that this party will lose its representation in the municipality of Barcelona in which 5% of the votes were to be obtained.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragona's revolution. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Mayor, Angel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record significant growth.
Currently the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to establish lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida with thousands of travel passports
Apart from the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers arrested by the police station of Barcelona formed the djihadist cells controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Moving for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, which claimed 2008 106 deaths - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior points to these investigations as a major issue, which goes so far as to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" has been "weakened" and "with its ability to act" with the "Operation Kampai" of the counterfeiting apparatus Al Qaidas worldwide.
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "combatants" could freely cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The discovered cell is not the only one on the djihadist network that was active in Europe; therefore, other European police units have been involved in the investigations, with the exception of the Thai investigative bodies, and it is not to be excluded that similar attacks will occur in the EU in the next few days, such as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) a further one was carried out in Thailand, where Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikalaya Kijbumrumrung were arrested.
They had been led by Bangkok from the cells located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - in particular the tourist passports were stolen in accordance with the standards of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents on the name of men aged 25 to 45 had to be issued and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to display visa stamps.
In the course of the investigation, it will be stressed that so far no links could be established between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of travel passports stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent through a money transfer company, which had been "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" who provided an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have issued extensive documentation.
PP requests from Mas a representation of the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally present Arthur Mas's conditions to support his position as the Prime Minister of the Generality, which are not different from those already put forward during the election struggle and to combine with the priority of economic recovery and the abandonment of regionalist independenceists, such as a financial compensation agreement which the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to Arthur Mas for security, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to make her feel indispensable. For the candidate from the CiU's bourgeois-regional party is indicated that at least one of the opposition parties abstained in the vote at his office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to join in the forthcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP. However, the discussions that the mass is currently leading with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the PPC is concerned, it demands that "all speeches concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region, like in the Basque Country, and which the Head of the Party of CiU even wants to submit a referendum, be set aside.
Both political leaders agree that they want to make the regional administration's built-in political apparatus more flexible and to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the entry of Mas deal side by side with the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old care centre confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures".
The owners of the Old House in Olot do not rule out the killing of their nurse over 11 older people
Yesterday, the managers of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference showing the damage that Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse, who killed at least eleven old people he was responsible for during his work - had added to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the court and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the death cases)", but "the right and our liability forced us to accept the process and the civil liability".
The institution must not only suffer a social loss because it did not detect the caretaker's criminal acts in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé has been told that the first crime will go back to August 2009 and that he has since then continued to kill.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but that the formalities had been completed by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The leader of La Caritat outlined this point around and stated that "the remaining measures could never have been the reason for the events."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no indication in the dispute that someone other than the accused has committed a serious offence."
The man who was already baptized as "Die Angel" was killed eleven yesterday and declared that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later killed the second old lady.
In this case, he killed an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The leader of La Caritat explained that access to the medicines by staff is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the tranquilizer cocktail were used by the nurse in six of nine crimes committed in order to relieve the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila lies and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victim or if he burned it from the inside by giving them bleaching, as he had alleged to have done in three women whom he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, one does not give the caretaker’s statement of faith, even with regard to the number of standing murders that could be much more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila made very different statements before the court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change her behaviour after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these cases of justice.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Yesterday, investors reacted sharply to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our response capabilities."
The risks of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the European banks' shares have risen by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and that the euro has hardly added to points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illicit market, which, to the extent that it collapses again, however, is due to the closure of shorter and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to withdraw our liquidity arrangements, which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several more times in the future.
The Federal Bank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, since it was ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional fixed liquidity measures.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to "at least until March" to extend and the quarterly calls with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the programme to continue to buy bonds and to issue a strong signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if it is hard to insist that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, which confirmed that the bank did not take into account the purchase of sovereign debt securities and that the markets would then collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and sustainable.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot to provoke a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government's assets were only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in perception of the markets according to the words Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt gap were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at around 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it did not recognise the problem with the stress test in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must receive parliamentary approval of its new budget on Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel gave a moderate speech at the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. Political unity is asked to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethovens.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, government deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation and labour procurement measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has added 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchange.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year state bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are asking for a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our indebtedness.
For Spain, the request for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The treasure has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are too expensive and access to the markets would be unrestricted.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only does it count as being, but it also counts as being."
All right, we'll do it!
At the request of his children, the President of the Board of Directors of Eulen called on Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, the owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fade.
David Álvarez, founder of the company group, will challenge the meeting of El Enebro, which will be held at the request of five of his seven children on 16th, as he considers them "absolutely worthless". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - the owner of the wine Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their fight for the control of a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem to be willing to testify in his legal dispute to the control of El Enebro's organs.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Meeting of 18 January this year, which has already been registered in the Register of Trade.
El Enebro's meeting, which was convened by the Judge of the Madrid Commercial Court No. 2, for the 16th time, triggered a new strike at the Alvarez family.
The judge's appeal for adjournment of the assembly is the only legal way that ensures the convening of the meeting of society.
The latest strategy by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be designed by David Álvarez as a "depressed means of the applicant - his five children - to be recognized by legal excellence, fraudulent mechanisms and abuse of justice by the Assembly of 18 January", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the Assembly's claim in the background to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who are hiding in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to call on a congregation in the right direction.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, besides other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter that the judge has decided in the hearing on the proceedings for which no date has yet been established.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull came into the world of Formula 1, its history in this read universe has been characterized by the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one gave any new attention and despite his steep rise in esteem during the last season, all of them were at the end of the race in last November to win the Ferraris by Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to put down the abilities of German pilot and world master Sebastian Vettel or the power of the engine of Renault, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into hand, creating a team of winners, became a legend.
In reality, this is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to authors.
This software software called PLM was used to develop assembly chains in factories around the world, energy works and high-precise instruments.
A true reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real-time" can design and implement the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm argues that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the stations, who could have made at least three or four improvements in a season.
In the Red Bulls team today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful EDV systems they perform analyses and all possible changes to the racing cars.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all components of the Red Bull racing car, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements will be modified.
The changes can be transmitted to reality within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator by means of advanced production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend on its competitions in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
Everything that's going on there is top secret.
The team includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer puts into the service of his participation on the race lines, there are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and their popularity is zero.
The head of technology, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, progress in the area of F&E for racing cars was still said to have contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the pilot’s contribution is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett Packard (HP) dedicated his first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner, Ront Reyes, yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first sales network consisting of twenty shops with between 80 and 100 square metres each to be opened by the Multi in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees with the existing 16 sales areas in the multi-brand company, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The Vice-President of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned as an example the refurbished warehouse at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with HP for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of them in Spain.
The first were dedicated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mr Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming new openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next target.
The Vice-President, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of loading opening is always the same. It is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American company group advises on this and takes over the exclusive charging equipment (with interactive products to attack).
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of cargo personnel.
Helena Herrero said it is not a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive sales network is intended to "optimize the customer service and the advice of small and small companies when buying and then even the packaging."
The Barcelona store has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and small businesses as well as for private customers, because large companies have already concluded their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years to 'kluen' a million customers
Banco Sabadell's chief executive member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for banks, but first a new liquidity crisis and prophecy throws the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a break in the interest rates that banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to receive a million private customers in three years - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700,000, if you withdraw the customers who will lose the bank. This is the great challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, say austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has brought all the plans of the banks together.
This year, Sabadell will complete its Optima Guided Plan, which was originally designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended for a financial year.
The customers who leave the savings are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardianola stressed that 2011 would be a "hard" year "with a great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain only "slowly" comes out of the crisis.
Furthermore, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "to create work" - fundamental for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - punishing interest margins - will run out, the risk assumptions that banks and savings have to pay for their emissions in order to maintain liquidity are already being dropped to the price of loans as compensation for exploding profits.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We haven't turned the branch, but the interest differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto issued the arrangement on her branch network to restrict the granting of long-term loans and increase interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the stategy "to increase fees", however "within a framework characterised by competition".
Sabadell's plan is based on organic growth, even though the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It does not, however, ensure that "larger companies are needed" in Spain.
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He emphasises that the need for capital is currently "great" and does not prevent some Spanish financial institutions from falling into red.
It is the opinion that FROB can replace the money market when capital increases occur.
After ensuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he rejects the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put into practice, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing can be achieved through repo transactions and therefore the crisis can be tackled.
ECSC excludes a second fusion wave of savings
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish Sparkers began, several Sparkers did not take part in the first phase. They remained in the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers are completed. Cajasol's inclusion in the Banca Cívica group cannot be seen as a second round, but it was an adjustment."
"The majority is completed. It may be that we have instead of seventeen or fourteen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all operations."
In a breakfast organised by the Association of Managers and Managers of Aragonia (ADEA), Olavarrieta concluded that the concentration process "has been completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely course that was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with a total of 75 500 million is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger than what we have accomplished the Basel agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta stated that "there are a number of unintended opinions about the slowness of the process, the insertation and insanity" because "Banco de España reminds us to complete the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous funding systems in Europe and "maybe" in the whole world and added that those who doubt this "without any further knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we need to "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be completed "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had been very good at the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time has laid down conditions for the European Union as a whole.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of fixed-term enterprises or the cancellation of the 426 Euro support for unemployed people, which do not relate to unemployment, up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, deputy government chief Elena Salgado, with the help of former government president Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the responsible person who has voiced the current crisis.
How are these procedures understood?
It should be noted that the brand position is not an error in its public works.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which coincides with the maintenance of the old traditions of a majority of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, we are starting to speculate in Germany about three possible way out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, had to leave the euro area in the south.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although the current sounds rather like Science Fiction - is supported by a majority of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is a reorganisation of the euro according to German proposals, i.e.: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; penalties for countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the payment adjustment of some countries and the expansion of the costs of potential adaptations to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been marked for some time. That is why there is no reason now.
First of all, both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government has moved to a constitutional reform from the Army in order to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the interoperability between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practice of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country as a mark on Greece's decision to save Greece painfully.
At that time it was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel is emerging with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable a country to be saved and, at the same time, to oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because it led to the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
But its proposal has been adopted, even if it does, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think beyond it.
It tells everyone that, even if unaccompanied measures are to be taken now, the old way of functioning of the euro will no longer exist from that date.
In 2013, the birth of a new currency will be the year of birth in which the countries that are cooperating can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case the private sector will have to take over part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to set a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, consumption measurement, productivity improvement and competitiveness, as well as positive external economic balances.
The other alternatives based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as indicated by Spain in tree times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we'd do a bad job not understanding it.
It is not only about lowering the state deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will get more quiet.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis to create order in his own house has been prepared.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
Among the options under consideration is that we should not exclude the euro area completely blocked with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show an inventive spirit, but not the will to act a sanction.
The alleged exclusion placed by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to the release of a lot of ink about whether or not it was an unsportable act and whether or not both players should be punished by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) and played several crowds so that the judge would show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league game against the Auxerree and thus enter the next game phase without any cards.
Finally, UEFA’s Disciplinary Committee punished the Club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice; it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the Ethos - the unwritten but following rules in this sport.
Part of the ensuing debate on the case goes back to the fact that a team of the Real Madrid Football Club (who presented noble courage and honor in his hymns and on other occasions had punished his players for similar events) played the main role, and to the dramaticization by Maurinho, who added an episode more to his long history than theatrical and provocative technicians.
In any event, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these acts constitute a rule of procedure, and in fact this practice is in keeping with the statutes of sport, but it seems to be acting on its own.
In this respect, the damage caused by the sport spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the abusers taking unfair advantage of the opposing team. This too did not happen.
The paradox of the actions of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under false play or rule, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly completed in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as reprehensible as possible in order to punish it by the judge.
The players waited and accepted the penalty gladly.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the offenders of the intentional mob draw from.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival has not been placed in a more unfavourable position or the benefits for the game played have been increased, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have this player.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, to a certain degree unknown advantage, as the team could sometimes also leave. Furthermore, the players with this approach receive a penalty and go over in the second card cycle, in which they leave with a card because of card flipping less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Finally, such practices are not against the spirit of sport, which also include strategic decisions in order to maximise the benefits of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to impose a penalty (that would actually be a clear case of circumvention), they rather wanted to choose when they were subject to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between the gift of invention and the rule environment is obscured, I believe that this is a clear case of the gift of invention.
I have the impression that the controversy was caused by two factors: because it was about two self-contained keys and because of the type of rule transmitted.
The damage added to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offering positive for customer capture for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year will drop a maze of reservations on 16 and 17 December.
The holidays paid by employees themselves are expanding. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the Christmas season that lead to Barcelona's host and leisure activities of oxygen. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they set off a price offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the companies and associations in question confirm.
In order to make the booking even more complicated, the calendar (silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of a maze of reservations of dinners at two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008 when bad times began, many companies have set up group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to abandon this tradition, many workers pay these from their own pocket.
As is always the case, the lowest prices are required, confirmed by the President of the Barcelona Hospital Board, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the roof association has not yet been able to predict what the holiday will look like this month.
"People think about it 'thirty times before they make a reservation."
"They want to get out, but they pay high attention to the prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, so prices are asked at 25 euros the most.
In a survey in various central restaurants it appears that the evening of December 17 will lead the provider to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that requests for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 guest houses in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led the ownership of the calendar to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, you do not lose optimism after the second quarter of the year, when the revenues are flourishing and good, even if the prospects for the Christmas business are not met for a few days.
Sources from the company group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 Euros or more was added to the six group menus. You have the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details in return, such as Cava.
Even in some companies, green sprouts can be seen, which is why the employees are invited back. This gives the impression that the groups are in the process of recovery.
On the side of the Fecasarm Roofing Association (with connections such as the Barcelona Kneeping, Restaurant and Leisure Association), the Vice-President, Enric Gomà, is confident to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are all quite "living", even though the customers "exploit a maximum".
However, the fun at the celebration has not gone back, no one pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is of great concern in the United States
Islamabad represents nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
The disclosures of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State, revealed by Wikileaks' Internet portal, confirms what enormous concerns the Pakistan nuclear program Washington.
On the edge of the clear and judicious details that provide the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of atomic security is not strengthened, but rather "absorbed", and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the specific nature of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled but are stored in their individual parts to make it difficult to destroy them when possible - Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The following risks are listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear weapons to the area attacked by the Taliban, the alleged proliferation of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen not only by the United States but also by Russia as an outpost and as a reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan has to set up strictly credible personnel to protect nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
New documentation revealed by Julian Assanges Internet portal shows that cooperation between the US and Pakistan in nuclear proliferation is lagging behind and the increased rate in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" states: "Frequently there is no transparency; we do not receive answers to assistance offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, a member of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic catastrophe of Pakistan, nuclear weapons are produced as quickly as any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington, during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clear up" the responsible, that "Pakistan's army has its silent support of terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning about the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can only be clarified.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "infuse and persecute" of Assanges.
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
Besides, she's not new, she's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australia must commit in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Already on 20th, the International Police Office, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but was not notified until yesterday after obtaining the power by the Swedish authorities.
This is how things are. The 188 Interpol countries are asked to identify assanges and find "to capture and deliver him in advance."
Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States consider the Red Warning as a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to stay.
Assange's lawyers felt that they published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the Swedish authorities' questions by videoconference.
They also recall that Assange applied for the exit from Sweden and was granted the appropriate authorisation by the state attorney named Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of security of Stalin.
"It's like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," the letter says.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia appreciates the innocence of her son - Assange stands in an unknown place, yet not silent.
On Monday, he gave the head of Time magazine by Skype from an indefinite location from an interview. During the conversation, he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for arranging North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the United States, it had to retreat," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "laughing and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told the broadcaster CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, with the prevention of new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to give less attention to Assange is contrary to the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to charge their money and to prosecute anyone who supports it or contributes to it."
Tom Flanagan, the consultant of Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to recall his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama should turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Anyone who has been able to secure information in the government is guilty of treason and everything that is not directed is a mild punishment," he told the sender Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the Carod near the ERC with an eyebrow
The Republican Head shall allow the Party to vote in secret on its stay in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the first time an internal riot in the ranks of the 11 MPs after the loss and half of the voter's undirected ERC.
The chairman is aware that his threat of withdrawal is not sufficient to the immediate members of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as its mentor himself and he will not have the same head fractures as other former flows.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra with an eyebrow tries to win the new critics, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the first time yesterday, it was announced that over 200 regional council members from ERC could speak in secret about their stay in the office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the charodists wanted to pass a penalty list to the president, they could do this without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of subordination among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel with half of the votes plus an unconfirmed one, and he added without indicating percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would also not be good.
Carod's neighbors ask the president more than the party to provide its office. An insufficient gesture as Puigcercós controls the top organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the Management Board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be submitted to the Governing Council on 18 May.
Their intention is to provide for Puigcercós. In contrast, this will promise to present to the Congress in autumn 2011, which already holds the party summit a fact.
The chairman of the ERC is the view that "polyphony" is damaging stability and he strives to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors for all times.
In this sense, the article signed by the official councillor Joseph Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovacó considered it a fact that the chairman was supported "in exchange for different objectives".
He counted five of them, two of which are at the forefront.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the board represents at least 90 per cent of the members of the party, which means the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally abandon the principle of assembly as a function.
In this way it advocates a reform of the statutes, which will enable it to hold congresses with elected delegates.
From the end of the plenary model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which has already fought at the last two congresses for this, is how to occupy.
In fact, at the 2008 opening meeting, the party leadership was commissioned to review the principle of assembly at a convention to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This is still the case, as it has not been advisable to deal with this issue because of the internal concern of recent years.
Now, without the critical sector lying on the laurels, the time could have come to take up this matter again and to end it forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, four cases were listed in Mexico in less than 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in Mexico, according to the statistics of MILENIO México, four less than in the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the find of two amputated bodies in the valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, we come to a total of 390 deaths, which are probably related to organised crime.
In the case of San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a place in Toluca, stands out.
The subject had at least three shots caused by firearms, the gun was handed over to his head and his feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle located on the street of Mixtecas in the settlement of Santa Cruz Acatlán of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, farmers found a body with torture marks early in the morning and at least three dead shots in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
In addition to the body, a message was probably found signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight gunmen after he left his house to do his job as a miner.
On the seventh of November, two 30-year-olds were sent to the head of the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement of the town of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with the gun of grace was found on a single path in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a cartridge shell fired with a firearm of the caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewage channel of the settlement Playa Golondrina.
The emergency department was looking for the rest of the body, but she didn't find it.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán were informed of the find of a body they had discovered in the area of Peña Colorado. The hands were tied to the back and the head was tied.
The man had a wound that went through his throat from the shooting of a gun.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported to have been killed in decks and found in the trunk of a vehicle located on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda of the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the village of Valle de los Reyes in Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two dead women were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning they found in Huixquilucan the body of a man who was probably Mario Ríos, according to the message that left his killers next to him.
In the settlement of San Francisco Aquautla of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman with gunshots was found in the neck.
On the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains were discovered with appropriate images.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with tape were discovered and a message was discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Against the body there was probably a message signed by a criminal organization saying, "That happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found attached to hands and feet with torture trails within a taxi located behind the justice centre of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one was caught in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and cut into black plastic bags, and there was a message. The second one was tortured and found in the streets of the settlement of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a dad with a message.
China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of China stated on COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and that it would maintain its supply to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, says Su Wei, the representative of this country on COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and to transform his industry.
He argued that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which sets out the targets for the reduction of gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the authorities of the Federal States had worked with those of the Central State and the municipalities to achieve the energy saving targets, an effective use of energy and emission reduction.
In addition, he carried out, some multi-year plans have already been launched or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those that received money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private.
There is also a project going on at provincial level on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional sparks through energy saving banks, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than they were generally expected.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amount to six tonnes per person, while it is 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
Similarly, it makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the past five years and is expected to take place further by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former PAN president had the right to appeal to the National Committee of the Rules of Procedure and to demand what the right conferred on him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN's chairman had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to demand what was right for him.
In an interview before the complaint, Gabino Cué Monteagudos took place as the governor of the state, he declared that the exclusion of Espino was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to refer in his case to the Commission de Orden del Sódez Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it should not be thought of at the time of 2012 and that an alliance on presidential candidates has never been at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Action National was strengthened by internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN is looking back on 71 years of dialogue, so "doesn't scare us into internal competition; on the contrary "we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly need to select the best president or president, the Action National, for the next three years, so he would transfer the staff "to those whom the Council would determine."
"I am completely unconcerned and open, and I would be proud to hand over the office of chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party's upsurge recorded in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not the time to think about 2012."
"Now it is up to Governor Gabino Cué to support his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would wear flags and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "a lot of hopes and aspirations are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the requirements."
When he was questioned about the criticism of the PRI by President Felipe Calderón for his record course in his four-year government, César Nava called on the supporters of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he confirmed.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government expresses himself as he could in his speech in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there is no oral prohibition and even less censorship.
Obama applies on Twitter for the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," tweeted the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the national mobilization to support the Dream Act - Laws on the Legalisation of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on social Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - Act, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this Act," tweeted Obama.
Its short message contains a cyber link to a broader document that calls on the public to contact with their senators in particular, as the vote of the law immediately prevails.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The message was spread after the 42 republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except for the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced by a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
On the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable could be established for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement about it at any time and then we can plan the outcome of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would apply for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act Act, with which the initiative to legislate undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize about 800,000 young people who had immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while the last five years lived in that country and were enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the prosecutors of the law need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they are referring to the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organisations of the sponsors of this project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the advocates of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer supported it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put the finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Love of the Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked author Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placesres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish literature and used the title of her question on this occasion (at another event the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble", the Argentine writer shouted sweetly against the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela reads a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and then marked the shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what is a "wound" and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she receives no answer, but guidance for the guide of her story.
The infectious scientists are convinced: "Experience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who stole the breath in the middle of her walk, and who explained that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the story is mildly relieved and closes that she "experienced from the wound only that it is really open and not exist". But she is convinced that the desire in the language and their cases is mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a thrilling story that he called 'lob of invention' and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With depictions of magical reality, he tells of a famous witch who touched the clouds brought back distant men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turning turn and reported on America, the great novel that it did not miss at first to its own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the heroes.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers) laughed at the pretense witnesses who appeared in the stories that were presented as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even gave way to shame."
However, he argues that "it is the crazy and the liars who imagine themselves the best", and there are reality and lies that approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story is on, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that the Phil had contributed to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman devoted her contribution to the great wounds of the social violence that her country enjoys - like all Latin America - as a result of the fights against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unintended commitment," she said after pointing out that literature is communication and commitment that builds between the author and the reader as in a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the dedicated writer in the wounds of the writer", said.
He noted that in a fast-life world also the intellectual habits and control of consciousness go out on dogmatisms, and is forgotten, "that behind every confirmation is a small no and behind every denial is a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to finance: and nuancers often mean to put their fingers in the wound and insult those who feel much better when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also to insult the powers that prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and called to rediscover a sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he has experienced up and down in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, there are also two different styles prescribed by their respective trainers, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced up and down in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has remained well, why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentine player has played with the medal for the second champion, he has remained a step behind the winners and amazingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategy reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the toe in hand, with which he suffered a major defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, with 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to re-enter a coup because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went undecided after 210 minutes of play, but at the elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two possibilities to enter his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Devil Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore he does not want to be persecuted again by the accident and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that for him the most important game is himself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, that's for my affection that I give myself, and that's why the title comes to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," said the taxman when asked about the lost finals.
The last final game is still very much in his memory, he assures us to learn a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from is that until the judge does not tip the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared for it with two eleven meters already, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is over, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shooting, does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the Elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense effort to keep the title in the hands that left us something for this final game, and we hope that this time it will not come."
It is in Romanso power to be no longer just the second champion and to spend the glory that the title brings with them.
The US changes the rules for receiving a visa
Persons must present themselves before their consultation at the consulate at the visa application services; costs will be reduced.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedures for the application of a visa are changed in the United States and in the consulate.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their consultation in the consulate with the Visa Application Service Offices (ASC), the initial letters in English.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the graduates, including:
The total costs for the processing of the visa are reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay the deadline for processing the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handled separately.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for time workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa must not have a conversation at the consulate, they must only imagine themselves at the next ASC, where they present their documents and receive their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulate of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the 26 dollar service charge.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, see the following website: http://mexico.usebassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the find of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to present tomorrow with a fund that will have an impact on the search for life beings in all.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will present tomorrow, Thursday, an astrological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts from astrobiology. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
At the invitation of the press conference, NASA assured them that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", triggering speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments that have so far been considered uninhabitable, there can be human-like creatures. It was suggested that these could be transformed into intelligent beings – like humans – if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, this is a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all forms of earthly life, as the lake is heavily arsenic.
In some ways, microbes use arsenic as a means of survival. In view of this ability, the chances are increased that there may be a similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms transform the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it has been shown that "there is, in fact, another form of life, a second form of life that differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce tomorrow, Thursday, the actual scope of its fund at the press conference.
The conference was attended by geobiologists Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of life on March, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question whether his chemical composition of the earth resembles.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern form an opposition block
With the reform of the Organic Law on Congress, the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition bloc was already installed, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as independent. The four questions were: the introduction of the 'Two-Party System' into the chamber.
Before the opening of the 60th legislative session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patron Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'double-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as the parties that controlled the Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau, led by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political position with these reforms.
He argued that in the next few days they would speak with representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so, they would leave their political will and if they did not, they would be wrong again by both parties to put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this end I come (the opposition coalition), which is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even look back to taking the opinion of the others into account."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patron and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be accepted, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that will rule an eternal two-party system at Congress."
"For the beginning, this group begins with five Members and they speak with other colleagues and colleagues to increase them," said the member of the Convergencia.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, acting on PAN and PRI, claimed that the Congress had now turned into a 'boot' for two.
"Before it was just a party, now they're dividing it into two."
Mr Montalvo asked the honourable Members to respect and assign their seats to the negotiating meetings.
"It must not be left out because of the top five decisions which are likely to be nine Members. The five that are currently seen as divided into different groups have decided to unite to take our place on the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and expanded by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the disputed owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check over a little more than 200,000 pesos for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1,200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued at an amount of 200,144,56 peso with number 9258447 last November 16 with the use of "accounting for open accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent more money from the municipality to this supplier. She is being watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells it at high prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that you still owe her and hence the number of checks that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't bought with her, it just pays the debts, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "found" in the last quarter of the year "again": 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last from 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as prescribed by law when a company is questioned by the ASE to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be reclaimed.
After the newspaper Noroeste had published on 25 July the examination of checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was announced that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had already paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
Shops with Jumapam also took place where they took checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Gloria Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the collapse of a foreign tourist in the collapse of Gloria Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán requested special attention from the authorities, the areas in which they are in a bad condition and which are taking a bad picture to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Zone Dorada, recalled that on different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that the tourists have found into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and roads would have had a negative effect as tourists came to shine and saw the disorder, from which they would turn their backs to the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means one day to close up a company and they don't think about how much money they lose. Otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist crash would have drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the continuing maintenance of the city.
"The community has to take responsibility and avoid doing something like this again. How should it do this? Well, by taking preventive care to improve everything in the future," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city. Because not only because it is a foreign transport area, it must be maintained, we also have a right to a clean living area. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that are also neglected and incomplete," he said, "e.g. el Escundo y el Venadito by Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and the tourist attractions are constantly on fire," he added.
"These measures have not been given sufficient attention and these kinds of events simply make it clear to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoção Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be properly used and made a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places to be brought together with the city to Vordermann. The city should be a priority to make clean, orderly and attractive for foreign transport.
" Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that first had to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive for foreign transport and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise for this purpose.
IP calls for results from Congress
Mr Davalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the Members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
The business sector of Mazatlán calls for a worthy Parliament, free of disagreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is exhausted and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was dedicated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alliance, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel obliged to the society and the various social groups that are responsible for parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same pattern of partnership and paternism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Enterprise Coordinating Council, proposed that the new Members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right to act free of agreement between the parties, because it is customary for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, so that they turn into carnival competitions of the ruling and the leader of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the bridges necessary to support the current government.
"We take care of them to do a trustworthy job and to act primarily in behalf of society and its groups, because they were the residents of Sinaloa, who expressed their trust in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 peoples is to drive and work together for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the foreign transport sector, he called on the new Members to allocate the necessary place in the State budget to assist the Ministry of Foreign Transport.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the two-way funds. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been reintroduced in previous legislative periods, must be brought to the latest stage.
Holy King Seeked
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family were looking forward.
For parents, it will be difficult for them to meet these wishes the next Thursday, because the budget does not consist more and less of 12 people and a goat.
Yet Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toy and the clothes they look like.
The family lives a modest house in the settlement Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth because the father has no hard work.
"Sometimes hard times have been said because my husband doesn't have a job. But we're selling Mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I'm going with the holes to sell on the street," said Cayeta Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For some time now, ten-year-old José Alfredo wants a 'monster car' and for that eight-month-old brother Jesus proposes Cayeta's clothing in the size of one-year-old.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I would love this monster', but I replied to him, 'Let us wait, boy', for it was very expensive', recalled Cayetana sadly.
For older children in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple of size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King Is sought' by contributing a toy or cash in the reception room of the Noroest newspaper.
14 drug addicts arrested
On Wednesday, the 10 domestic investigations in the administrative region of Austria were carried out in the framework of the destruction of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and various charges are brought.
The home surveys were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the main drug production should have been used.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschisch, cash and equipment that have served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were considered to be the main substance of the drug ring from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons should have been released in Sherbrooke for hours before their arrest.
They could, among other things, be charged with the production of cannabis, whose possession for sale, the plot and the service of crimes.
These household investigations had taken place as a result of a long-term investigation that took place over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said M. Ruel.
About the 70 police officers of the regional investigation unit, Austria, the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Office had participated in this police operation.
The secret migration could be prosecuted without any problem
The draft legislation of the Conservatives, which the Government says is to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret migrants, will be stifled as far as possible after the three opposition parties announced Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I will stand up with emphasis on this charter."
"I hold with a party that has put you on foot," explained Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session in front of the Assembly Members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person who is identified as a carrier by illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Constitution as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Québec Bloc, also indicated that he could not support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
Criticism about the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned aside critics who claim that their party did not stand firm enough against the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that measures are being taken against blind passengers, and that is precisely what we are trying to implement by means of another draft of legislation, C-35," Chow said.
Therefore, we do not support the draft legislation of the Conservatives because he is looking for guilt among refugees and keeps children trapped for at least one year," Chow said.
Immigrant Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians tell the MPs implicitly that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal proceedings involving Canada and treating the country as a pedestrian."
"You expect Canada to take tough measures," said Minister Kennedys.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its draft law which could have led the country to elections that would have rejected the government.
A conservative, however, spoke against the QMI agency, the government would call for a vote, so that every opposition member would immediately declare itself against its voters.
The new unit does not match
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and corruption by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the establishment of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Research on this subject last January.
Since 1870 the metropolis has a standing unit against corruption.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has more than surprised one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the least at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite Robert Dutils' presence.
Also, it was not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Québec Party, qualified this announcement in point of public security as "a rabbit enchanted from the hat" and "a solution that was correctly applied to a table".
Minister Dutil had, in turn, turned to those who feared that the political power would have too much influence on the future unity of the instigator.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he was pleased to confirm.
"You're aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to be a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this bag, he proposes to Quebec that financial auditing be given a special mandate to enable it to conduct investigations into corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of inspection," he said.
He also expressed the view that Quebec's control of the inspection could have the same power as the Commissioners, which would allow it to oblige people to make a statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the schools of the government Charest.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal law accordingly in order to be better adjusted to this type of crime.
This request comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law in this form of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain innovations related to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which involved the groups of motorcyclists, 131 people were arrested, although the penal law had not been renewed.
Ottawa has therefore enforced the law against gangsterdom.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has been raging since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauritius, it came to an earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening, another earthly event took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administration region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday, heavy rains fell from 40 to 70 millilitres on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 additional millimetres of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday night.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain was dropped here.
As the snow melt which has already been collected in certain sub-areas is still to be taken into account for these rainfalls, it is feared that several watercourses will be violated.
On Wednesday morning, the Quebec Security Service issued a warning on the high-water alarm regarding the Oueau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudier region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian mountains and in the Chene in Lotbinière will be the object of high water monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the severe defeats have attracted the violation of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was missed due to the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the breach of certain lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains alerted and monitors the situation very closely, so said security advisor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Landeshochwasser Centre issued a warning of the strong rise in several rivers, especially from Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouereau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loop.
Dupont partially assigned
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont, before the Canadian Board of Supervisors for Radio Standards (CCNR) for his controversial statements on social care and Haitians, as well as for his extensive speech on radio, has suffered a partial setback.
The CCNR represents the opinion, Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have had the right to their own opinion, but certain statements would have "inaccurate information about social care and unwarranted negative representations of Haitians as well as such unhindered speech which is not appropriate for the broadcasts broadcasted over the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide violated the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first was made available as a result of a complaint from the "Front common des persones assististes sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were not accurate.
The moderators should provide more solid than misleading information.
Regarding the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the view that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message communicated was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Board of Supervisors takes into account that the impact of the mission "Dupont le midi" would have cut off a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was presented with no table against his person.
The last issue was the statements referring to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Réné Dufort had provided a media-efficient argument that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had explained that it was not in favour of Haiti's aid, as one did not know for sure whether the necessary ones would really receive the money.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments have not been abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already abolished my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My act has been a misdemeanor for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board advocates the dissemination of an unbiased expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted "in addition to his obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, inter alia, should have been communicated once during the main terminal period within a period of three days, are limited.
A King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has made a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact with King-Fu), kickboxes and Thai boxes, is now looking for new challenges to the Tatami and boxing rings of the world.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with martial arts such as King-Fu and Kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to develop under the profession.
Personally, I am looking for the fight of all kinds, because for those who do not like the fight of the ground, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, he had issued bad news to his rivals as a security officer and to the UPS employees, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have achieved the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China."
"It was invited to the fighters of each category who had placed themselves in the last world championship among the first four."
"I got baby 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"2005 I got behind in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I became third in 2009 in Toronto," he added.
"It is noteworthy that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I'll be the first one this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sana" are disciplines from China, in which foot-and-mouth strokes and foot-steps are permissible as well as ground throws.
The twins usually play on a platform that is rarer in a boxing ring.
The most famous boxing fighter that has emerged from this kind of combat sport is the Vietnamese-born Cung Le, who is probably known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event left in his career, he would surely call here his presence at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This contest is the highest and most respected in China," said the sympathetic pounder.
"It's a bit like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest Thai Stadium)."
"That was a great experience."
He had won his first battle in the semifinal of his category (80kg) before he lost in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro," he analyzed.
"There are four opponents per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-final meet each other at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the lead to crown a single champion, the King of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Quebec has agreed with project planning companies 450 million dollars on contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
A consortium consisting of companies BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely the project management, to a total of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called "Energie Gérance", was formed in 2004 as an escort to the decision of Hydro-Quebec, the private sector to respond to this important hydroelectric project amounting to $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" awarded the contract without a public tender.
For the Québec Party, taking back company consortia poses a serious ethical problem that highlights the risk of distortion of competition and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and discourages competition."
"This means that instead of playing cards, they are now secretly running in open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ MP, yesterday at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be used in this way.
In the afternoon, resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded by saying very much in Abrede that this contract would have been a card game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, by strengthening that the PQ has been "unreasonably" and that it "misses her hard".
She said, "It's the least," that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common worldwide practice.
It is usually a temporary alliance which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope.
The construction process is in progress and is scheduled to be set up by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without a competition; there had already been negotiations.
Furthermore, the model of the Consortium in Quebec itself is no longer an exception for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devor" noted last week, the model applied in the field of engineering and consulting is the subject of government inquiries.
A short overflight of the Quebec Company Register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any connection, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Energie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Bay of James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special account for this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has reduced the nose over the fact that the project management contract has been approved by agreement.
"If you make an invitation to tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will rise rapidly."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this March and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that the price is not crucial, but the expertise of the people," Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the consortium "Energie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over 50,000 dollars received by the Québec Party.
The contracts were approved by either the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to the review, the Le Devor newspaper has awarded more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, were granted between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had taken 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16 Texult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking part in "Energie gérance".
All these treaties have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard reported that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) of the "Parti liberal du Québec" were known.
Minister Normandeau had made allegations that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that they "funded" before stating that it was rather their leaders.
Barometer Response Conscious Consumption - The "green" label is not confidential
Greener but unharmed sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little about the marked brands or eco-labels that should control its choice.
Unfortunately, although it is in a media-efficient universe, where information for a more responsible consumer only seems so cloudy: the barometer responsible consumer has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacies that makes itself known as the brake of his commitment, as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of the so-called 'socially compatible' products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to be trying to sell them to pay little credit.
Two thirds of Quebec's population admit that in fact they have little faith in the environmental commitment of companies as well as in green corporate advertising, the measuring instrument issued by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke betrays.
Another finding is that half of consumers have doubts about the reliability of the official certificates added to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the political discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
The information on responsible consumption seems to be important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently being revitalised by only about one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, empty and doubtful nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer at the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are disappointed with the stated performance of green products and services they are trying to afford.
According to another Communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from traders in their city district and benefited from the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the environmental-consumer index had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal protection.
However, the social and environmental awareness seems to hold in front of his car, so the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport in 2010 or preferring the transport centre to demonstrate its ecological interest.
Access to access and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which provides for clinical performances.
State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been called upon by Société Angus and the company Parallelèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus and the company Parallelèle, who had hoped to receive a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris film complex belonging to Daniel Langlois on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, obviously did not receive what they requested.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, however, under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a loan less than the initially expected amount that could bring about a viable solution to favourable living conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources taken from the state-run kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the request has been re-adjusted to the following total.
A proposal, together with an action plan, was already sent by the president of Société de development des entrepreneurs culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who leads the eXcentris Act.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallels and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to these.
At any rate, the premiums of the State contribution seem to have been really pushed aside.
We recall that the Quebec Ownership Community of cinemas and cinema complexes had refused a direct state investment to support the takeover of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance for real estate projects there that he had not even allowed other cinemas to come.
However, several other market participants in the segment claimed substantial economic assistance.
Director Daniel Langlois had presented the author’s cinema in the rooms of his cinema complex for over ten years under great difficulties after the self-funded construction of the cinema, which could justify the exemption from the state fund.
The lack of cinemas that show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus and the company Parallele with Christian Yaccarini at the top are running a privately funded campaign, from which they hope a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas next February, with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux" again.
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not call the newspaper "Le Devor" and one ignores what he and his group hold from the suggestions that have been made to them.
Raised the secret of complex shuffled Canada
The new American diplomats, which were spread by WikiLeaks, were secreting what the United Nations considered to be the least valuable complex of Canadians against Americans; however, with the same blow, they reveal the superiority of the latter against Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters do not have the Canadian-American relations in mind at the election, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the Conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more picturing details than the only substantive content to be bottled up.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal electoral campaign was in full swing, reports on the extent to which the United Nations no longer participates in the efforts discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, an American ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"One of the Canadians' almost indwelling minority complexs may cause the Canadian political leaders much more to talk about internal issues of everyday conflict than to move the United States to black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, as he concludes, is therefore "the verbal Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this "silver-silver silence" less, since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he said, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind when entering the urn as a key factor."
The second expression of this feeling of importance is read in the communication sent by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa on 22 January 2009 to President Barack Obama to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence over the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada will be declared its first deficit after more than a decade, resulting from a lifelong program of between 30 and 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
He had not mentioned anything that the government had to postpone Parliament's sitting before Christmas to prevent Parliament from falling apart from the coalition and thus the continued existence of opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed live programme.
Another message written by Ambassador Wilkins from January 2008 understands Washington from the increasingly negative picture that the broadcasters are spreading dramatic series from the United States over CBC.
The messenger is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle plays on Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or also performances for the purpose of perceptions carried out by the CIA's muscle defenses.
Again, another communication detailes how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleague Bernard Kuchner, at her first bilateral meeting, whether Europe was ready to arrest certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with a yes, but on the basis of an individual 'case-to-case' decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described "he handed out a paper to the Secretary of State at Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the act."
Finally, we note that the mothers are warming up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper's very close advisor, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "transmitted".
He referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday, in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW) corresponding to almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan adopts its position in the footsteps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations of industrial countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW released to the earth would be avoided if the white glowing bees, which so far represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or even better, by LEDs.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the world’s fleet.
Last year in Copenhagen, large emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global FCW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 g of this balance sheet had to be deducted to stabilise the rise in climate by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent it from being out of control.
In the white glowing bees, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
The compact light sources reduce energy consumption by 75%, and the new LED light sources reduce this energy demand twice again.
The compact light source contains between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has placed on the market this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white glowing bear, which conveys an adjournment of the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new sparks give only very little heat, they can also work with a regular resistance.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have shown that compact light sources have reserves because they contain mercury and therefore need to be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for producers.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, however, is not the compact light source, according to the report, but rather the coal plants that emit much more mercury in order to generate the electricity generated by the white glowing berry.
In the United States alone, these coal plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects exciting announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "unearned" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Côte d'Ivoire immediately after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to receive its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," said a UN chief press spokesman.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure from certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had allowed the deadline set at midnight three days after the Sunday election, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI on television confirmed that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from around the world have been made, and the CEI can finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the distinguished Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation of "fraud" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouves (UN) during the coup that failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Alpine Coast presidential campaign, confirmed that the UN-practiced manoeuvre to intimidate voters in the north of the country had scared the President's supporters to go to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contractors are now more of the view that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically close associate with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who denies any connection to the former rebels, has considered the delay in announcing the election results as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even though he has not gone so far to call for victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost; and bringing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of a country's union and reconciliation process, which was split into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the policymakers of the Côte d'Ivoire that they could be held responsible for any outbreaks.
Laurent Gbagbo had enjoyed the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), thus showing the preliminary seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is set at 2,631 million.
The data for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In particular, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not or whether they were not seeking work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has worsened with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points per annum) and 25% among the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed according to the IAA.
For their part, the elderly have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% involving the departments in overseas.
Only the 25-49 years olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a dispute over its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a company and brother of the President of the Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), a investigation procedure was initiated and he was sent to Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence during an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of undermining social assets, spoiling of general goods, horticulture, corruption co-operation, illegal bribery and possession of weapons, as his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is willing to fight and has the intention of expressing himself on all the questions that will be put to him by the state prosecutor instead of spreading hiergespins."
"It's easy to submit a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agency France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (the Socialist Party) in the department, had put the judge’s attention to having a memorial to his justification before his hearing through his lawyers.
A relative of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, she had never done anything other than keep her deposit that he had to run.
As regards the business area of competence or the destination of the associated fund, he would never have known, says Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Balling Area, was also charged on Wednesday for subjugation and complicity, but then under the pressure to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My mandate was able to provide explanations of the facts that had been submitted to him."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and released from prison on Tuesday night, including two of them under legal supervision, as Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorized interference and passive denial".
Two state officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, one under the title "Reduction and destruction of general goods by an officer of the public service", the other because of "competence in the destruction of public money".
Alexandre Guérini's life companion, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and undermining social assets".
Among the persons who were confronted with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently arrested because of a similar case of public fraud involving Corsica.
The hunters suspect his society to have contributed to the laundering of money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public procurement, in particular in the disposal district, will be carried out in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
Closely identified sources suggest that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the supplement and the operation of a depot in La Ciotat, which is also waste from the region of Aubagne, as well as from certain cities in the urban area of Marseille (MPM).
Business Clotilde Travel: the Elysée Palace overrides its central function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was arrested in Iran for "spiring", the French public in the spirit, shifted the diplomacy into alerting and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attention of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some of the reasons for this crisis.
They describe how Elysée had told the Americans its strategy, which went so far as to give these advice to deal with their own crisis of "welcomes" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the release of young French people did not have the benefit of the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and of the American justice due to trade in material in support of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Travel, in a bright light.
In fact, he had not done anything in this regard.
A diplomat telegram published in Paris on 12 August 2009 bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée's strategic advisor, was accompanied by Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They urged the Americans to do everything in their power to bring back their own people who would be violently detained in Iran.
"Power of noise," they said, "articulated loud and clear and without interruption" the words "basic human rights", "innocent", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into focus, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this as much as you can, especially if you ask the Iranians not to do that."
Because "Shut up won't solve anything", through the discussion attempts on inexhaustible ways, the Iranians are "masters in shiftovers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "current, Iranian tactic": "welcome for political repression".
He announces the release of Clotilde Travel from prison (which should occur on 16 August, the day she flees to the French Embassy) "requires payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he lets it be said that the Elysée anticipating further hostages, a phenomenon that will "harden itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Travel has been released from prison 12 days ago, but remains in Iran.
Information has been released: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery to Iran is demanded by the United States due to the illegal trade in sensitive electronics, has been released from prison following a judge's decision in Paris.
The American message, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the nuclear programme material.
Did France buy a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranians from those of the French?
On the occasion of a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "totally surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to stand against it.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French Secret Service.
The Elysée consultant elects a telephone number, re-supplys, informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "now located in the buildings run by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the preservation of Clotilde Travel in Iran, Elysée does not respect its efforts to make sure that, by means of adjudication and by the media-organised "future attempts", Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influcient middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 describes "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is so much "thank you" based against Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy asks.
"Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague knowledge of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document thus deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fail this fiction.
He analyzes the intensive communication efforts "to confirm Sarkozy's opening policy towards Syria".
A 2008 policy was launched, which was perceived "by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"The Syrian role building up" attempts Paris "to lead Syria in the face of what promise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also "to sow enmity between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier entrusted her with: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians have done anything at all."
"But we thank each other in spite of everything."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Travel returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Aschenbroidel", which will forbid young people to play after midnight online games by blocking their access to so-called government officials.
A bill to encourage online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under 16 years of age after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, represented by cultural and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and thus have difficulties with learning at school and also with living a normal life."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this bill's deputy minister of the French Press Agency Agency France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6am.
For a year, manufacturers would have been preparing for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also takes into account the fact that the producers ask that the time limit for access to these games be extended to those young people whose parents ask for it, added to the responsibility.
It will also provide those who wish to provide free programs that allow you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report events related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in online game competitions worldwide.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the Head Country
In light of suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints on Thursday the World Championships 2018 and 2022, a top political choice in which the range of influence and lobbying threaten to undermine the technical criteria in the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands).
The 2022 edition will then turn out to be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Cataran, Australia) for itself after the 2010 premiere, or continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or in Fernos (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir von Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch government chief, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship.
So the machines behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It was difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
Following the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of the two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also well have ruined the chances for their own country, the path of football, which could only be the only time the world championship was allowed to austere, that is, 1966.
On Monday, the BBC gave the food floor again by issuing a documentary report that took charge of three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
There is enough reason to make FIFA angry and to expose the English officials who, first of all, had engaged in intensive lobbying with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The chief of government hopes for a reintroduction of the chess tournament by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the 2012 Olympics organisation for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to reassess the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because Duo España-Portugal does not miss drums with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, the Olympics 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about Solvency Spain and Portugal are increasing the chances of Russia, which has become an important outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stations, hotels, transport).
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to call for the unwarranted adjudication of the views of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by committee members.
"You throw it with shit, you try to compromise it," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seemed to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, based on FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages for Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new candidates appear to be early for two countries that co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA's name is the WM 2026's approval for China, which would have the Asian chance of 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are more at risk, for certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the lack of television rights (due to the shift in time) of FIFA's sensitive nerve.
Second term of office: openness
De Gaulle had really supported it.
Mitterand had made him think he was short.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than this.
A mandate in Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is the side of the mystery that holds the Presidency function, not good face.
So you have to do it as if there's no doubt about it.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chiracs submitted that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it itself.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy made a serious effort to make his decision " sometime in the fall of 2011".
The fact that he would have the prospect of "two mandates" beckoned in Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians on the Tuesday evening had therefore spread a little fever.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Long missing.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year term of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election on occasion of such meetings in a humourful tone.
"You've been with me for at least seven and a half years," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't believe that I don't think about the phase after."
His words of yesterday do not make him a candidate any more than the day before; but not less.
Should they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy is driving to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which reminds many members of the PS earlier than assumed to be combatants.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, voters of the rights would prefer a candidacy by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46%) against 44%, according to a survey of the BVA-L'Express.
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the Prime Minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always believe in winning," corrects Alain Juppé, who has resigned from the public.
Euro: the ECB is forced to preserve its procurement of public documents
The last meeting of the ECB's central bank last year should provide an opportunity to show how to emerge from the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of non-conventional monetary policy measures to be concluded by the end of the year.
The European public debt crisis is bound by the fact that the central bank in Frankfurt cannot, without a doubt, make the present situation more difficult on the European loan markets so as not to cause them to deteriorate.
Political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role of the ECB in favour of solving Europe's state budget debt.
She did not dare to say whether she felt that the central bank could do more, for example by linking her programme to the purchase of public bonds.
"I retain my thoughts for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, did not show much interest in his plans, but rather welcomed the fact that the programme of the purchases of public securities on the secondary market would "be extended" and that at the meeting on Thursday we would "see how the decisions go".
Only certainty: The ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the purchases of bonds by the treasury from the ECB were doubled to about EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to some traders, yesterday they were supposed to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state paper.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price among the traders (see page 29).
The local authorities are no longer expecting any significant change in the price.
If the lending transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be made available to the unlimited reserves of funds in a free way, over a period of one week to three months.
The local authorities are already considering that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
" Otherwise she would take the risk of creating new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Volksvirt of the Commercial Bank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," says Norbert Brems, Volksvirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that will revive the market", adds Norbert Brems.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks in the euro area sovereign debt markets, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter the market at any price to the sellers of the missing investors and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm over the incomes paid to the weakest states," a key bond holder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates were to be used for high flight, the states would be even more prevented from reducing or stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government covers Italy
After a week of concern for Italy, yesterday the situation was somewhat relaxed with the decline in hornyness to 10 years.
A return to the truce.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, Regional President Giulio Tremonti had described the situation as "undigital" and had seen him with an "unpredictable" weekend, but he immediately demented it.
On Tuesday, however, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached their record of 210 basic points, and the prices of the contracts covering the risk of competition would have increased to 263 points, resulting in a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with the German interest rates is at 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself as "heavy concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of inflammation from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
The text says that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, rapid tax revenue that would put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although the Senate's budget for the review is estimated to be 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, according to the EU Commission, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
Therefore, the call for a new budget collection, which could be used up to €7 billion after the holidays.
"If necessary, new savings measures must be taken," says economic analyst Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as less stabilization progress is required than from other countries, despite Italy's high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.d. R.)," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD's head of staff.
The question of political insecurity remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a suspicion request from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the previous elections could be organised at the end of March.
There is therefore a little favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the expansion of anti-crisis measures.
Christine Lagarde pointed out yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe you have proved it on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans keep clearly together, are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency."
Although quite relative - yesterday's withdrawal from European government debt interest rates was water on the banks of governments and the ECB.
From the beginning of normalization, however, this cannot be the case.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt record, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which is particularly heavy on banking systems," said the opinion of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, "the political time passes much slower than the markets".
The European countries, which are aware of both this scourge and the danger it poses, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in the future, with their counterparts of the G20 are going well.
This is also true of Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan sets out the fate of the unconventional measures to strengthen the backbone of the euro area countries in the cross-border markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, their Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in Fernost about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of his visit is not an expressive fundraising, he will certainly prepare this for the terrain.
The first expenditure of the EU Stability Fund is foreseen for the following month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of the agency Reuters had entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, first of all, are working towards structural reforms, especially in the labour market organization.
Reforms to be added to the savings measures, however, will have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid cover a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other are at any price to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have drawn up their own budgetary corrections and have decided on essential structural reforms that will bring them back to their confidence.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of public bonds markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way to Paris on November 24th, had come up with the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not be slow to get back into its own pocket.
The majority of Barclays Capital, with regard to the European public debt market as a whole, decides that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This means that the European financial stabilization mechanism currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
A council which has every chance of being examined carefully in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are bad.
Snow and ice cream: 24 departments in Orange
The snow episodes are still hampering traffic difficulties, especially in the UK secondary transport networks and threatening to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the alarm stage Orange due to the threat of snow and ice risk.
The regions Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the 20 departments already in the alarm stage Orange; 18 since midnight and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes reach the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it cuts easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm are expected, depending also on 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are concerned.
Snowfalls are significant enough to cause traffic disturbances and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France says ahead.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Britain is very difficult, according to the traffic policymen who refused to use their own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, and the use of some TER buses was deleted all day.
In Picardie, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the Wednesday.
The prefecture "requires drivers to be most careful on the streets and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) invited airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights from the Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of Orly's initial flights due to expected heavy snow accidents.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airlines.
Gatwick Airports in South London and Edinburgh, Scotland Airport are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy in the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris is called to mind, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the construction of the GSP, the state has called for a capital grant of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would thus allow to give to the markets part of the financial sum twice.
Today it has finally come to first calculations.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was reviewed this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax for the closure and higher taxation of offices in the Ile-de France.
First, the adoption of Article 15 of the draft law "is in favour of the public-law firm Société du Grand Paris".
This is mentioned here: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
Secondly, it is a reorganisation of the existing company tax: "to modernise it to increase the product it produces and to respond to this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
It's a puzzle.
This sum is not specified in the text.
From the 4 billion you're far away.
"It is carried out that the tax resources will be charged to the 4 billion euros of the capital grant imposed by the State and the Société du Grand Paris will be carried out progressively for the project," the explanatory statement is to be taken into account.
The SGP does not even find this system offensive.
"From the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the design over three years and then create only from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and withdrawn from time to time."
The SGP is expected to start 2013 to score the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four billion promises are still to be sought, is a risk of triggering a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Prodigious hacker and emsy spy
The WikiLeaks business has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sanctimoniousness that governs the relationship between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm that every secret service-created act (an x-like nation) consists exclusively of newspaper cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what one has been reading over the past months as well as in every x-like journal (other than those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly cartoonized profile of Gaddafis offered Cabaret artists for a long time ago material for their sketches.
The rule that the secret files may consist only of well-known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rose Crossers) exactly repeats what has been written in previous works.
This is not just because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (although he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So are the secret files.
The informant is a fool, and a fool (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be anything else, for example editor at Liberation), who only considers what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which had sent the American message in Rome to the State Department, was the same as those who had already published the week before.
Why, then, was such a removal of the disclosures of these files made?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of research films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of sheer holiness that one does this to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the task of piety and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-like hacker can seize the secrets of the most powerful country in the world brings the major blow against the prestige of the state desert.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "scarfichter" in distress.
But we dedicate ourselves to the deep nature of what has happened.
Previously, at Orwell's time, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his underwear.
Orwell's prophecy could have been quite right since then, where you can control any movement through the phone, any transaction done, the hotel visited, the chosen motorway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you look into what is happening today that even the secret encryptions of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control stop being unilateral and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the richer of the citizen - can reveal the secrets of the power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be disclosed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconis or Markels is basically a secret free from secret, because it gives the public sphere a prize; but in the style of WikiLeaks it is offensive that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, meant to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks has neither done Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this limitation that has been added to such a powerful power?
It is clear that the states will no longer place any reserved information online in the future - this would be the same as an exit attached to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is missing with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state has moved on to an aircraft and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relations be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds after science fiction and romantic, but I see the need to introduce myself to the government agents in a secret way, moving around in uncontrollable marches, carrying their messages anywhere but in mere memory, and hiding in the shoebox the few written information they have received.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically the spying attempt of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing today like a cancer, that is, backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized the communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephonic) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had allowed the film researchers to explore a film band for the band by blowing back and forth all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs today have nothing other than jumping from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroports.
With the high-speed trains, you can travel to Milan within three hours from Rome, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including the take-off.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology return to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In ancient times, the press tried to understand what had been embroiled for secrets between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks of its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the implementation of the quickly solved financing commitments (also called "Fast Start" or early financing) implemented by developing countries.
And already the great French beauties have been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised €7.2 billion over three years, France €1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast-start financing: a detailed report of its Member States, a press conference, major events, a brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and is appreciated for its real value: developing countries and civil society like to see it if all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces release in 2010 of 2.2 billion euros, which brings it in the right way to meet its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use has been made, without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission has proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for those for the year 2009: international funding will be maintained and will provide for 150 million over three years in the context of "Fast Start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France believed that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no guidelines for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even be reduced) - France proposes to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the unlocking of donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and each one chooses his own calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent with 1 donated €.
Obviously this is only difficult to bear: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to the emission inhibition can be justified based on the most efficient technology), it is prudent to present the euro taken as an equivalent for a securitised euro... In addition, only the costs of the loan for the capital donor country should be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following considerations: it "respects" its obligation of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and spending 8.5% euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that employs loans to a large extent.
Germany requires 46% while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including) comply with their obligations 100% with donations.
In other words, if the majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfil its obligations, France will only give 10 cents and understand a comparable use.
Beautiful hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double twist: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial use.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in line with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Bercy who made the award) could have a double negative effect; once inside the EU (why do the other Member States continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of early funding is just a small question of relatively short time compared to the overall discussion of climate.
But it could be too much in the huge machinery of the UNICEF.
We hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this early year's funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its type of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, namely in the spirit of respect for its obligations and the balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward the debate on the subject of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed topic): one does not get away with the question of "recognition" or the way in which its loans are booked.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
So hope is based on the new Minister of Environment Kosciusko-Moriset, who will meet in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast-start and its vision of "comprehensibility" and the use of loans would naturally raise from the international base of confidence that is needed for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticide taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes over day 81 different chemicals, so a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (formerly movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations) published.
The association, which explains that its results "due to the low number of samples analysed do not give a statistically significant value, but rather illustrate the problems dealt with", had usually bought between July and September, within four years, from an approximately ten-year-old to the meals consumed plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been studied as well as wetlands from laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is low: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possible or likely carcinogenic and five as safe cariogen classified, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptive factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if in the near total cases the legal limits for each chemical, individual substance used are not exceeded, however, this survey is very well taken into account that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disrupting factor is alarmed," notes the association.
Already at breakfast alone contains butter and tea with milk already more than ten of the possible carcinogenic residues and three safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungiicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna fish from the cane, even the baguette and the rubber of pesticides and other chemicals were bitten.
In the conduction water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
During the dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined, chemical residues were the "richest", and even the plastic lighter used to warm the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pest cocktails" for consumers is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) proposed, for its part, "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 residues of various pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
