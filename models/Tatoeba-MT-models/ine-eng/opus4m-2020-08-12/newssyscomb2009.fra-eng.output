Triomph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria have led to a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current large coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffers particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, prepares a triumphal return on the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remained, with 29.8% of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, lost 5.5% of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent lost nearly nine percent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties, particularly for the popular party, which launched the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, voters make them appear to have let the government collapse.
As a result of the first reactions, speculations about the possible resignation of the leader of the party and current vice-president Wilhelm Molterer were made.
Observers believe that this could take place on Monday at the special board of directors of the party.
Such an evolution would have facilitated the way forward towards the outcome of the election that remains most likely, namely the renewal of the Great Coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the books (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the populist party agreed with the populists (at that time, the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 the BZÖ separated from them) on a common government, which even raised sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Comer, who has already stated that he was ready to work with any party and planned to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament is the Greens, but they have slightly lost and, amongst the Austrian political parties, have returned from the third to fifth position.
Of course, no other party crossed the four percent limit and did not access Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India risk cooling
If there was no solution to the problem of Czech researchers accused of illegal cafards in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that there would be some cooling of the Czech-Indigenous relations.
The Minister will declare it today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, followed by a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, in the course of talks, that executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling, since the case was placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"Your problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could request bail and await trial in freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner expressed itself in the same way during the talks.
"The advice to appeal to a higher court, as a result of which it might be graced," says the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicted people, the Indian Minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We want above all to keep with India the best relations, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers to be a great disgrace," he said.
The Minister ignored whether he had obtained India's promise to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said only.
A Czech adjudicates the battle for the bottom of the sea
It approaches a walled electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he was not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Her boss, division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and full time to another.
Hard work and enthusiasm are characteristic of the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms for the unknown moment, which may contain the key to the development of a anti-cancer drug.
A Wider Background Than the Hard Land
The coastal States have begun to aspire with zeal to the new sub-sea territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they are in fact using their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is especially the area of what is called the continental shelf, which is often several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
The latter may, under the Convention, claim exclusively all resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, it is considered as a continental shelf the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousand marines, which represent such an exclusive economy," Mikulka explains.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the outer borders of the continental shelf should be supported by broad scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous cost-effective prospecting and control.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific assistance.
So far, the Commission has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its sub-sea holdings, has recently experienced a global decline.
New Zealand, too, has gained from the territory - the extent of the seabed, which the Commission assigned to it last week, amounts to 1.6 million square kilometres, which is the extent of the country multiplied by six.
The two countries have invested millions of dollars in prospect.
The benefits they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they propose, be invaluable.
In turn, other countries will progressively submit their requests.
They may do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, proclaimed by the convention "common patrimony of humanity".
There, no State no longer enjoys an exclusive position.
The right to extract in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nonetheless, we are not mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, adding that "its areas are clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is also now part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of the countries of L'est within the framework of the "Interoceanmetal" joint organization.
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from some other States, it obtained the status of what is called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The investor's area slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moved, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it from a range with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a rich deposit in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Ryan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a achievement.
She remembers a small apple of earth, or, with a little imagination, the mythical Shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on hand for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were never put into action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are revealed.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal military specialists and GSG 9 staff members from the Federal Police and Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from Technische Hilfwerk, were on the scene of release.
As the Department's spokesperson communicated it on Monday night, the German forces were finally not required, the hostages who released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Government of Egypt would have accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it on-the-spot as a support force.
"It has not been fortunate enough," said a spokesperson from the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transhipped into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostages has remained vague so far, as well as details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have, in the meantime, arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the hostages released were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Billd", the five vacationers and special forces should have taken off on board an Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The House of Representatives of the United States rejects the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed the $700 billion heavy financial markets rescue plan.
The Dow Jones was in the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the United States House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by the President of the United States George W. Bush and political men at the head of the two parties, the program that had to play the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the players had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called on Members to vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the investor's concern that the state rescue plan could cover.
He left shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now designing serious new turbulences on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and approval of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
With regard to reservations for the next few months, according to a study, the number of cases has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite low cyclical prospects, the thirst for German travel remains unsatisfied according to this study.
With regard to winter reservations, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent over the same period of the previous year, as entrusted to Berlin on Monday by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to a survey by the GfK Research Institute, increasing number of reservations already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have increased by about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the DRV.
The sources of these results are GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low cost of the dollar, travel to the United States would be particularly requested, said the DRV.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our opposite, would be destinations specifically sought by the Germans.
The trips organized in particular are very much requested, explained DrV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy prices and food products, the costs would be here "more easily calculated for the customer than for an organized trip individually".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts of early bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been so much kept that an increase in sales figures will be re-registered compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
The hits of Ballermann or Pres-Ski on a continuous basis, from beer in pickets to liters and celebrities in Tyrolian costumes to design.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV animator and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is an opportunity.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes at the beer festival, and the photographers are already throwing themselves on us and filling their memory card - very flattering, and this is my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The Tyrolian cheap costume seems to be reaching its goal.
As a tourist to the beer festival and normally living north of the Weisswurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume has so far been limited.
But once on Therse Square, everything is half worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolian costume or leather pants; no one has the smell or shame - it's completely normal.
Only my Tyrolian costume board collects a few odd eyelashes at the stand of chocolate bananas.
A barbarian makes me notice that I would have misattached my board: "to the left means free, in the middle of the virgin, to the right married, to the back of the widow."
Discreetly, I triple my back loop to the left.
"It's better," she tells me, and she laughs.
Others do not give themselves so bad for these subtle techniques of flirting and wear simple features, on which is written "Too drink to get dressed!" and exposes us to their bare back train without being invited there.
The young man at the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, who comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer festival.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an "oooo" along.
He tells me all this after he's relieved of the cup he had drunk before.
Right next to this fire mouth that everybody thinks is a bubble.
So Bob is one of those "wild hunters" sadly famous.
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, succorists' bells run over the place of the feast and must take care of poor drinkers.
Rather, the nurses intervene in the middle - always four times, they pull their tent-covered civic.
This works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we get back full.
Those who rest in the circle of the burrows under the bark are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't go down any more," he yells at me one of the succorists in answer to my question and then disappears in the mud.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died at the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon, in town, on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she died there.
As a result of the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspected dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Even before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, European powers were eager to enter its back country.
On the east side of Bosphore, 20 steps may be, from Asia, one of the finest remnants of its noble imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is located at the bottom of the platforms, with observation towers at each of its corners, such as some German provincial mayors.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the ballot box, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which is a move to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a late in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and has the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab rebels.
The relative isolation of its area around the area, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the forces of the empire moved beyond Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train carrying ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it's a sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, choking in the ruins of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, underline the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
Isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a Turkish capital-led wagon, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour trip, on a stormy rail with a cadence that reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stones and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and many pastries in which middle-handlers in costume-cravate-men and women meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right-wing politician from any other party in Europe.
Suit, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
" The purpose of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly" he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"But, here at some point, "I asked if" shouldn't Turkey choose?"
"Turkey" he said "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then stressed an aspect that almost all those with whom I was able to speak said with my heart: the Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is an advantage for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to be drawing a Europe that is metaphorically travelling on rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I reconsidered these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in Turkey's hands.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the time when Turkey was called "the disease of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: The musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (born 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Taking advantage of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was to include at least 21 years of age, but before Proteus was able to sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years of age refused to leave the choir.
The term "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any kind of music that was presented to him, be it madrigal or messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this was due to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how many Tod repeated we "let the music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything's in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even though it was never dictatorial or apparent.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be appointed knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the 1960s to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever let me down, and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had so rare this combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated the drivers who, according to him, "focused only on some people".
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your neurology of William Woodruff (born September 25, 1946) states that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSC, MA and a PhD".
That's what came from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at Nottingham University, and at the same time finished a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to dissimulate this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "the Flamenco and life " because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they convey and to the fact that they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second hit for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already has a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
In addition, a few refined machines are added, which increase the comfort of driving and save more fuel.
There's been a revolution.
So this is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it must be pointed out that this new Honda Jazz is six years after the first generation's market.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model within a shorter period of time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercial car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Exactly in Japan, almost a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with about one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase his sales in Europe.
Thus, whereas in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it was thinking of selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has traded 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish branch expected to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to pay much for the downturn in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers hope to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, that is 4,000 cars in less than in 2007, that is a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2 % in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the company hopes to commercialize nearly 200,000 cars a year around the world.
Depending on the markets and estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of Insight will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is planned during the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters plus), its width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters plus), and the distance between its axis is 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change by 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space is also increasing.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a reserve of fuel in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of additional capacity compared to the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L case is 379 litres.
The other innovation – in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof – is the improvement of access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an angle of opening of 80 degrees, relative to the rear doors of the first Jazz which would open with an angle of 67 degrees.
Engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 litres and 1.4 litres of fuel.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases the engine system.
The first 1.2 litre engine develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 rpm and 114 pairs Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, in particular by bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. made this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Marks Management, BR23C is the key to Nissan's security locker.
This robot will allow vehicles in the brand to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that looks much like the Nissan security shield.
But the most important are the eyes composed of the bee, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
He detects the obstacles that are at a distance of two metres and in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"When he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and will immediately change direction by pounding its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference compared to any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot could avoid obstacles.
" Each second, this device shall only process information and act according to these data.
There is no need to retain the information or intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we are not talking about memory giga-bytes, not even megabytes."
This is the first because of the development of new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into the series cars within a decade of Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ions.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding road obstacles.
They're afraid to be hypothesized.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not lacking in engineering.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to avoid Americans embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's to say 'the Hotel of Bad Credits'... or stories.
The lupus aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Master of the Hotel makes us think again and again if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
Of course, this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's more a game reserved for teenagers.
What if the game ends?
Since a bedroom appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to his table tour of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a strong decline in its scholarship course.
One week after the disclosure of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, an amount of $3 billion.
The retained price is less than 19 per cent than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28 per cent above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 at 5:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," explained John Mack, the director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which must allow him to diversify his activities but make it available under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had just announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizino, the executive director of MUFG, "Our pensions that participation would be entirely composed of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover us."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley 7% below its accounting value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of approximately 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if they change more than 50 per cent over the conversion price, i.e. at approximately $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a spokesperson from the group refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should display a Tier One solvency ratio of approximately 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has stated that he has "clearly" relieved his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tested for the group, which has seen its scholarship course collapse by half, while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt has flown.
This cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the bankruptcys of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refused the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, was the third to vote in favour of a new Constitution.
The mission is carried out as 64% of the voters voted "yes" at the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the more than one vote.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the end of the voting office and a non-governmental organization's account had announced a broad victory of "yes", which ranged from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed in a devastating way", he had ensured, welcoming the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the Governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in peace according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, was based on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution enshrines the State's power over the economy by reserveing the State's "development planning" of a country that lives mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies that send its migrants.
As elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will issue a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the rowers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back this Monday after noon to the safe and healthy capital of Egypt.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at 3 p.m. 30 on board a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, which was accommodated at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential area of Cairo, to undergo examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the rapists," said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 at a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the borders of Egypt, the Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been shelled from one cache to another by 35 unknown predators.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, headed on board two helicopters, had launched the attack on the night before dawn.
"A firefighting exchange has occurred, and half the predators have been killed, the others running away," said the manager, who demanded the anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commanders.
The head of the Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where it is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The guard, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on patrol from which the rowers were on board, killing in six, including the Chadian chief, and stopping two.
The army had claimed that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which had immediately been denouncing.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and this electoral campaign is under way.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up to report the amounts of poverty granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
What politician would you like to remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spend three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 companies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned about exploring history, preserving with three under the monsoons of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
It is they, often, who are the guardians of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states support the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in a state of emergency following the impact of the credit crisis crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it.The three countries support this financial and insurance institution, which also has interest in Hungary, up to EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition manager.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been amplifying for more than a year is for the Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will redeem nearly half (up to 49 per cent) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank will no doubt sell part of its holdings, including, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year by the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis' actions started a vertigoous fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it go to bankruptcy.
On Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, reaching its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, the shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's leaders, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the non-Atlantic uncertainty, in connection with the adoption of the US bailout plan of $700 billion, of being the source of the fall of Fortis.
On Monday, the papers have already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank, as the new Director General.
The financial agency was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Earlier, the Belgian government had announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic has been felt in the bank's clientele circle and no agency has been seized.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A kidney in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information about their purchases of medicines.
Information protection experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information on prescription of medicines, in all cases, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be between independent hands, otherwise it will be entrusted to a kidney" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on the insurance premium and the capital provided in the event of damage to the health status of the client present, and if they consider that the risk is too high, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they only signed insurance contracts with them after learning about the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it is easily provided to the pharmacies, the data on the purchases of medicines by the person in the last eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high fat rate in the blood, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in motion. At the same time, some determine a risk factor, so there is no greater thing to do to the insurer than the paperbox. However, minor problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program are the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat bubbles, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers to be aggravating risk factor, while the others do not.
Companies have developed in data research and analysis, and they must request the patient's authorisation before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
In the past, they were forced by the authorities, even though they had not been punished for their past failings.
Since recently, some companies have also dealt with the results of laboratory analyses, and linked them to the data on drug consumption. In this way, they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use becomes increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of authorities for companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is not enough and that is why he developed further before his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the individual's exclusive agreement.
It is another question to know whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus, and ultimately, chickens depend on the well-being of the kidney.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union and India increase their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a summit in France-India where there will be a particular issue of cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognized India as a major emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet agreed on their support for New Delhi's candidacy as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
They did not wait too long on this issue, yesterday, at the 9th summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Chief of Diplomacy Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply by two trades, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods has risen from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an ambitious goal.
In this regard, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil aviation, and in this way, air trade can also take shape in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and a United Nations conference on this issue has been called into question.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, particularly that it would like to reduce its toxic emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as on the need for a global market to pass at the next year's climate conference, and on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international work meeting to address the financial crisis.
The chief of state of India is now in the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth €20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the press agency's information, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
High presence of Italian publishers at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important is to meet internationally in the exchange of rights.
The International Book Fair of Frankfurt awaits this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square metres of the Hall with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as a guest of honor.
This will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the Italian Pavilion opening ceremony: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, in tablone 5.0 of the Bookmesse: an opportunity to present figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign authors' books gradually decreases compared to the total Italian production, and in particular to that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's sword, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying on the Nevada Desert, was found.
Debris were found on a 3,000-metre plateau, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Within the plane, however, no human remains.
The Sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, overcame the doubts that remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one that Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff thus stated that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding areas.
In February , the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead .
The U.S. Bureau for Transport Safety (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the sword was spotted, a team of local investigators identified the device: it was Bellanca 8kcab, who disappeared on 3 September 2007, when Fosset decolla from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a pull.
Fossett's research was interrupted one month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had made the world tour by plane and without a ladder.
Of all these records, the one that had stolen 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A 4x4 outside the municipality of an original and well-defined design, on marked lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the last born of the off-road "compacts" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content, the communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus the advertising battle that will accompany the start of the new car will result in an unpublished mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A Maxi exhibition project, articulated in three different phases, will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the auto in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special lenses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that looking at the image, the auto version of the display.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Remove8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, to then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see well.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Utras Italy" which has followed the Italian national team for years, and which has never created big problems so far.
He had never met with the opposite typhoids.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The proponents come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (unrealisedly) of Campania and Poules were added.
They had three-coloured flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all taken away to not be identified.
They are inspired by English typhoidism.
In Bulgaria, they found a true Nazi typhoid, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian typhoids, 144 tickets for the part: all nominations, and therefore easy to control.
And the Viminal had checked them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stage.
Four Italian typhoids who had a history of stage crime did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, the typhoids arrested or identified in the riots may purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo banning the Italian but also European stages.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand.
Good luck.
But now is the time for fear-emulsion: that is, others are at risk of adding to the hundred and fifty-first.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who does so," says the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially to match the national Wednesday team in Lecce"
In the Poules there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday, Casms, who can even rely on a section of Asia, that is, secret services, which are just dealing with stage problems.
"Duce-Duce hearts, and the arm stretched during Mameli's hymen? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here is Domenico Mazzilli's opinion (expressed in a very unpleasant way) as the director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a prefect in Trieste, where he lived a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli said, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the Observatory's No.1 - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see well what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about syllables against Mameli's anthem: they're not crimes either, but if you allow me, they're not cops..."
