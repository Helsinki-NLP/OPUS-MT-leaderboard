Members of the Assembly (AM, for their English stamps) of Gales are concerned about "looking muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP, for their English stamps).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament in Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this may be ridiculous.
A member of the Assembly of the Labour Party stated that his group was concerned about "remaining with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means caca.
A member of the Assembly of the Gales Party commented that the whole group was "discontent" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party stated that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that MWP's speech jump to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "The final decision, of course, on any descriptive element of the name of Members of the Assembly will be the subject of the members themselves."
The law of 2017 of the Government of Wales gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Wales Parliament (or WMP), but MWP had obtained most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly seem to be suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the draft law on change in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disablement of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians come to the polls to vote a referendum on the country's name change
Voters will vote Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for membership to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The campaigns of San Martín keep silence because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the older people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in each corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is not one thing or the other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now socialist people in another way," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors regularly go."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders wait and that "before or after, they will return to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments full of people who will not help the sanctuaries that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore they will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martín a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation was formed in the 1930 ’ s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the building.
A black congregation took the hostages of St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th street merchants, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted the hiring or promotion of black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged, and while Father Johnson's joys were making plans for his reconstruction, they also carried the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor".
In July, the expert who played the carriage called: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was the first carriage of the world used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who went to play Riverside Church carriage, a larger one, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the Bishop Diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some happinesses complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiburon here to a 13-year-old who was drowning in search of langostas in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child on Saturday as he was drowning in search of langostas in California on the day the langostas season was opened, according to the authorities.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed the channel KSWB-TV of San Diego that he had been drowning with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited because he had caught a loner, but then he realized that "he was shouting that they had bit him
malcolm. hunter@gmx. co. uk
"Hammel noticed when he came to the boy's side.
"I yelled everyone out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Children Council Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The succorist, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press wheel that had seen a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, Casablanca, to Swami Beach, Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the steps of their fashion and beauty facilities.
In order to significantly boost the UK's beauty market, valued at 2,800 billion pounds and with growth increasing compared to the fall in fashion and household management, the largest beauty corridors will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country and, if they are successful, the same will be done in more shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use space in stalls that were used for televisions, microwaves and household management.
Sainsbury's stated that he would double his beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweetman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
Also, in the perfumery The Fragrance Shop will try its concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments, the first newly opened in Croydon, South London, last week. The second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the change to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people that they are visiting them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, has stated that shops will increasingly look like supermarkets while the supermarket chain is trying to fight against Aldi and Lidl discount facilities by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points in hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted the sales of food and made these purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to renew their beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the revenues of pharmaceutical sales points into their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical facilities from Sainsbury to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds is indicated to participate in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's commented: "We have transformed the appearance and environment of our beauty corridors so that they can enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy."
Peter Jones is "rage" after Holly Willoughby breaks an 11 million pound deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, was "urgent" after the TV shower Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million pounds deal with his life-style business line to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and True supplements.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter announced that he was leaving the Instagram business.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by abandoning his lucrative life-style business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "urgent" when the television gold girl admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not allow time to dedicate to True, her fashion brand and supplements, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to duplicate Willoughby's fortune of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, announced that he had left the Instagram business, Jones left Great Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Truly was, by contrast, Holly's main priority.
It was going to be its long-term future, which would keep it in the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all those involved completely paralyzed.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, products ready for sale."
Experts believe that this morning's presentation, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of the important investment in products that go from kitchens and candles to clothes, and possibly even delay their launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago they have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV channel.
A source near Jones said that last night "it wasn't business matters."
A hard conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unprecedented" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his silly voice of "newsman."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country did not see an "appropriate response" from the United States to the first steps for the disarmament of North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out that the United States continued to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his mitin.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
They would have killed millions of people.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have generated positive results: the end of the tests with missiles, help to free hostages and bring the remains of US soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but so instead of 10,000 people out there trying to enter this full stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing out to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had had to move, there was no national emergency, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which makes things a little complicated," says Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Emergency Agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palau to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Given that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly little prepared when nature eases its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, has contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, traveling from one island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was located in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the key to the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has converted the improvement of Indonesia's spent infrastructure into the central axis of his electoral campaign, and has spent quite a lot of money on roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr. Joko's administration, which is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must deal with the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while bands of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, equals the marker to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of the Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri to something over 27 meters from the Chelsea gate when the marker was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before he threw it at the second pole.
The action sent him over the area and directed to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed over Kepa Arizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to play with the ball and the players like Shaq always play very well, so I tried to give myself all the time," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and giving him a touch. I didn't think too much of it, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea was going to win 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
Blues midpoint made a taco pass to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning a race near the middle field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic passed the ball quickly and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice pass to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and ended up throwing the balloon into the network of the second post with a left foot strap that Alison Becker, from Liverpool, couldn't stop.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool plays against Naples in the group phase of the Champions League. The meeting will be held at St. Paolo Stadium, Naples, Italy.
For its part, Chelsea faces Videoton at UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of Indonesia's tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency at first Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the debris of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and that dropped waves of up to six meters, according to the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press wheel.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with gunshots at Grayson Mews, at John Street, which took the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder.
The police have urged the people in the area who have seen or heard something to approach the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the initial stages, but would encourage anyone who was close to Jonh Street, in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend to any person, especially the taxi drivers, who could have caught something on the Dashcam that would contact us, since they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who believe to know women came to the scene of the crime to know where they had found it this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victims ' family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but the police tell him no one can come in or get out of the building.
He was confused when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now informed that they will be allowed back in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated like a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
I don't want to stop repeating "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon controlling the floor block.
Any person is asked to have information that sends an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously in number 0800 555 111, registration 247 of September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the last memorable success for "rewrite history"
Their ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "crazy" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a goal.
The iconoclasy of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
It may be sacrificed to Cromwell wrong by the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the history of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more late in the 19th century than at present, a parliamentary defender in the face of external pressure, in this case, is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a very precise description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the middle-century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a face of that division.
Your achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and commemorating."
A killer pig attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a Southwest China market, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered with blood near a shop in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, as South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder prepares to inject pigs into a pig in Xining, the province of Qinghai, China.
It seems that he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pouch was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig of almost 250 kg had attacked the farmer until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and ravaged," said the cousin, addressed by his name, "Wu," to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence on the spot.
It seems that the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although they're rare, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the injured man severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig about 295 kilos drove a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal.
After that, in 2012, some pigs started with a oregano farmer, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What to do is to have proper respect for them," he said.
The remains of the Pink Hurricane will leave strong widespread rains in the southwest of the United States.
As expected, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it moves on the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains all over the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind cracks of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane from Sunday to five in the morning (East Time) and was located almost 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are beginning to be generated, moving towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains in the north, towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain strikes with the low pressure it is approaching, there will be strong widespread precipitation in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, floods of garbage and possible deforestation in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rains, sudden floods may occur with rapidly worsening conditions.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn cannons into riverbeds and storms will cause torn winds and clouds of dust locally.
The low pressures approaching will leave heavy rains on specific parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave up to almost two inches of water, which could cause small spills of garbage and make the roads rebaladish.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparrons will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and the first hour of Monday, before the rain is generalized at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes in the U.S. may be observed due to Arctic cooling and tropical heat.
Sometimes this involves drastic temperature changes in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. centre on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the centre and east of the U.S. is expected a warm beginning of October, with generalized temperatures that will be around 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the north-east.
Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above average for the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's appearance
More than 20 million people followed the devastating testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, placed Thursday in six television channels.
Meanwhile, politics continued to be deadlocked and the media interrupted their usual programming to retransmit the latest news Friday: an agreement designed by Senator of Arizona, Jeff Blake, for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her in a state of drunkenness and that he had tried to take her off at an institute party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen saw it on Friday.
The company recorded the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a hearing similar to that of an American football game of the Oscars or prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fueled the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a day-long appearance, Nielsen noted.
ABC occupied the second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the appearance, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement informing him that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras caught up with him when some demonstrators tried to climb an elevator to attend a meeting with the Judicial Commission.
While receiving these complaints, broadcast live by the CNN, it was shown to be beaten.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued: "You have power when there are many women who do not have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a communication and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would tell more in his presence to the Commission.
Cable and broadcasting television channels broadcast everything live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate for vote.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI was investigating charges against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politicizing" Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plan to leave the European Union to "make politics" with the future of Britain and undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on his attack on the alleged Chequers plan for Brexit, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the tariffs of the other was "totally absurd".
Wayde Murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Diteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police point out that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses on the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A security of USD 350 000 has been established, according to the defence.
The Baton Rouge District Education Judge published a preliminary report on Friday, indicating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the nail that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the unit of fugitives of the State Police of Louisiana, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Aleva, LSU's sports director, thanked the police forces in the area for their "diligence and search for justice".
Yeah, I was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points in a game of the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU Balloon Coach, said his team is "damaged" and "in shock" by the death of Wayde.
"These are the things people always care about," Wade commented.
An ashtray volcano in Mexico City
Ceenza from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after the crater showed up and recorded 183 gas emissions and ashes within 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
In the social networks, the images showed fine ash layers covering the vehicle umbrellas in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Jochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters faced the riots while thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations coincided with the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized referendum on secession.
A group of separatists who had been cut off by the anti-disturbs threw eggs and paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in subsequent hours, and the police used bullets to contain the fight.
For several hours, independent groups, with messages such as "no forget or forgiveness", faced unionist protesters at the cry of "Viva España".
Fourteen people were cared for by mild injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
The tensions remain high in this region one year after the vote of 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the participation was low, as the persons opposed to the secession had greatly boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote at electoral tables throughout the region, where violent confrontations occurred.
The independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although narrow, in the regional elections of last December, the pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, whether in self-imposed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been initiated by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for embalming a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, have been arrested after repeatedly planting a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was caused to access and the building itself.
At some point, you might have shot the car with a bullet.
A Menga attack gives victory 1-0 to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by winning the second victory for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as coach of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's men took a position, with the Hibernian in second position.
This season, Gerrard's men have not yet won any victory out of the house and next Sunday they face the Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points of advantage.
Earlier, the Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday at the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingston is expanding its race of victories in the division to six parties. Holt, the incumbent trainer, has not yet tasted the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lets you pass opportunities in front of a powerful visitor
Holt's team had to have gone a step ahead a long time before marking, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson overcame the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow pulled the shot away after he went inside to finish Craig Halkett's head office in front of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems to visitors with ball games.
That's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an entry, with a combined game by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the balloon and marked it from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated possession, but they could not pass the host and porter's defense, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
This game continues until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, a Ranger porter, rejected Scott Pittman's shot of a kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another Livingston game.
In the area of Livingston they entered long passages constantly, but they were always discarded. Two requests for penalti were rejected, one after a Halkett entry on alternate Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
Livingston's Phenomenal (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont de BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to surpass the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
Your game style and your template have barely experienced changes since your rise, but this is largely due to Holt because of the way you have strengthened the team since your arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they were short.
They missed materializing the games, since they only managed to get into the opposite field once, which is a call for attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to launch a huge new mosque.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers were immediately present to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of them Kurdish, who condemned Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to receive it in the country, were also heard.
These manifestations reflect the division that this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocratic by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident took place near the crossing of Bestwokd Street and Evelyn Street, a road competing for Deptford, southeast of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was cared for by the paramedics, but he died there.
The accident occurs after another cyclist dies after being hit by a vehicle that ran into Children Street, almost two kilometres from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six agents injured after a disturbance
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation in a high-security prison for men, according to the Directorate of the Prison Centre.
The disturbances began in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue.
Experts from an elite team (called "Tornado") are responsible for controlling the altercations, involving eight internal members and affecting a flag.
The agents were assisted by minor facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service commented: "Expert prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing Long Lartin prison incident.
Six staff members have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and let us make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars."
The Long Lartin prison welcomes more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October of last year, anti-disturbing agents were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiards.
The Rosa Hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (arid areas could be benefited)
It is uncommon for tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week that comes when the last collections of the Rosa Hurricane cross the southwest of the desert, with the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, South and East Nevada and Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had preserved their state of tropical storm or depression on a 321 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the Hurricane National Centre provide between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rains, which can reach the 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Scarpe, Arizona.
It is likely that it will fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other southwestern areas of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Grand Cuenca.
In places where there is no risk of sudden floods, the rains of Rosa can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential rains will be beneficial because of the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the United States Dryer Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering, at least extreme dryness, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First of all, the Rosa Hurricane route will hit the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum of 136 kilometres an hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north to 19 kilometres an hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to rise in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"It is expected that torrential rains will range from 7 to 15 centimeters from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters", as reported on weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Afterwards, she will move by Arizona to the south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-west of the U.S. desert," says Hurricane National Centre.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and floods of garbage in the desert, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after he met another 16-year-old with a white gun wound in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area in Avon, according to the Somerset Police.
The agents have made a call to anyone who could have recorded what happened with the cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the massacre and anger" of the Democratic Party
"To vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the repulsive and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a rally held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the mosque and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the "US saw Kavanaugh's skill, quality and courage".
"To vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most successful lawyers of our day, a lawyer with an amazing history of public service," he told his followers from West Virginia.
The President made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy by speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"It takes five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't introduce myself, but it's a career," he said.
"That's why I'm going from place to place fighting for big candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on board a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held no later than Friday, reported a high-level leadership of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in a earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, the figure is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that struck the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying it all at once.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When it was warned yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB, for its Indonesian seals) in a press wheel in Yakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, soaked everything that was on the ground," Nugroho commented. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He added that some people had come up to the trees to escape from the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, bridges broken down and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT, for its seals in Indonesia) reported in a statement that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the city's geography, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be greater along the 300 km of the coast north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Dongala, Nugroho commented.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," said the Red Cross in a communication, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms not to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the officials claimed that the waves had already reached the coast when the warning was issued.
In a recording taken by an amateur and shared on social networks, you hear a man who was on the last floor of a building warning people who were on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall hits the coast, leading in front of buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great blow that cut the communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with aid from Yakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic products.
The airport of the city has reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims by Indonesia's tsunami is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although the staff of the World Vision of Dongala have arrived healthy and except for the city of Palu, where the employees are sheltered under a few lounges installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Dosseba said.
"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed," he commented.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as relief groups launched disaster relief tools, some people complained that it was not allowed to move to Palu with extensive experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, only funding, supplies and provision of foreign personnel can be made if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"There is still a catastrophe at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As soon as the Government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start to provide international assistance, but it has not yet happened."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing were hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring light to the devastating stories of natural disasters.
Saturday he took a little kid out of a canteen.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the trash for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, an instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had formed two of the missing paragliding paragliding for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"For my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he commented.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the release of the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who participated in the festival that was held on the beach.
However, his messages only showed a gray check mark, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves carry 26 750 USD during a reload of an automatic cash in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves caught an employee from Brink who recharged an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee, carrying $26,750, according to a news report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an automatic casserole located in the leisure center and was prepared to reload it with more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse of money for the recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about his identity must contact the Newport Police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rape Kanye West will begin to be called Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West".
It's been a long time since West, 41 years old, was picked up by Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
She replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the program creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," said West at the beginning of this year while talking about the album's title with the Big Boy radio speaker.
"It's you, it's us, it's us.
It turned out to be Kanye, which means 'the only', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of the many famous rappers that has changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in capitals or smallers, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, an elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would "never use the army to oppress the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired a peaceful demonstration at the square, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements on the left were being flanked throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed himself to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of I.A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A.'s investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments then arise the announcements concerning I.A. from several parts of the United States Government, even when, in general, the United States lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 innovation in I A. by 2030.
"Duplicateing I.A.'s research budget would be a good start, since all the other countries are far behind the United States. We have a look at the next progress in the field of I.A." says Lee.
The double funding means the double possibility that the next major achievement in I.A. is achieved in the United States, as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editorial Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an I.A. system that won the best American player in Othello. Later, he was executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized the previous technological competitions of the U.S. government, such as DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be, which would enable the next generation of visionaries to be identified.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to obtain government subsidies, Lee commented.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired senior university staff to work in I.A.
Lee commented that some changes in migration policy could also help the United States to intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China finances people from academic institutions as well as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations finance US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee commented.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract members of the industrial and academic fields. The White House announced the formation of a select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the National Foundation for Science, it currently invests more than USD 100 million a year in research by I.A.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation that sought to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held Sunday on whether their name would change to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim from its territory and has vetted its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, most in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether the participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper raised the following question: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from Yugoslavia's disintegration, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported in the afternoon.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% of the last elections to Parliament held in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters filed their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko filed their vote in the Macedonia referendum on a change of name of the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumika (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of the campaigns planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our very high head, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to enter Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that accession to NATO would contribute to the investment that Macedonia needs, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute, it was ensured that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters were going to participate in the referendum, implying a lower participation than required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation should be of 50 per cent more than one vote.
If it failed, it would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, slips all over Brighton's defense to mark a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling reiterated Brighton's defense in victory 2-0 that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the minute 65.
The Argentine midpoint received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He walked between three Brighton defenses before going into the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He slipped into a defense before exceeding several more on the edge of Brighton's area.
He took a walk to the left, where Sterling was.
The English front used its first touch in the area to return the balloon to Aguero, who hit it with his right foot to avoid porter Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the network.
"Aguero has some problems on his foot," said Pep Guardiola, city coach, to journalists.
"Let's talk about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the contents of the Premier League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
In that game, Aguero received the balloon very much within Brighton's territory.
He made a beautiful balloon pass to the left for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some hits before heading to Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Sky blues threw the balloon into the net just before leaving the limits.
The city faces Hoffenheim in a group party of the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine-Neckar Arena of Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals removed from the content by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the ever-competitive Scherzer expects to walk the mountain on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these triumphed before the Angels Dodgers in the Western League Division, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position thanks to the victory 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, we can at least walk the tire with the assurance that the Denver public will be animated and that the other team will probably play at the highest level than I have faced this year.
Why wouldn't you want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but it seems they tend to let Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The history of Washington's right is 18 victories and 7 victories, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Tromp to a Mitin in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, in speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November everything we've done is at stake.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't introduce myself, but it's a career, so I'm going from one place to another fighting for big candidates," he said.
And he went on: "We have this terrible radical group of democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to recover power through all the necessary means, see the mixture, the evil.
They don't care who's hurt or who's got to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to you."
The Democrats, he said, are aboard a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"We've seen it these last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats were "frightened, evil, horrible and false."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission by appointing Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who received the sneezing of the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Filter you the document?
Mmm, mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is already covering a wide range of opinions.
It's intolerant to people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was just surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Members of the Parliament of the Labour Party who are told he is not welcome, and only because of what we think.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received a treatment that seems to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe, and it turned out ironic that it was matters in which Jeremy was in disagreement with previous leaders.
As indicated in the announcement of the Nottingham East Laborist Party meeting on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the evening meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy is already more than forgotten, if it really applied at some time.
It is increasingly clear that discretionary opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party's leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues who previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect radical change of opinion and to adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a diabetes of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, reporting the policies of the centre, telling me that it should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexual or racist insults every day, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labor Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each motion "censorship" or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrower.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much and that it would be "good".
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Laborist Party 32 years ago as a student of secondary school, motivated by the neglect of thatcher's government that left the classroom of my full school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those most in need, whether as a councillor or as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to know my political positions or the areas in which I did not agree with the current leaders.
All I would say to those who promoted Friday's motion is that I do not understand these desires to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party when the country is headed by a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, be it from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: An Invited Ayr rises up
Two trials at the end of the party may have decided to some extent the final result, but, no doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining party of the Tennant's Premiership day.
Now they are heading the table and it is the only intuitive team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to make better use of the opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be happy.
"We have been tested in all parties and we continue to be invited, so I have to rejoice," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented: "The Air deserves recognition, took advantage of the opportunities better than us".
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Air ahead; but a yellow card to the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, a Warriors loan for the party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent, and Jason Baggot got an unconverted trial.
Climate broadened the advantage of Air with a penalty. Earlier, just in the middle of time, it marked and converted a test into solitary, which left the marker in 17-5 in favor of Air for rest.
However, Melrose well started the second part and the test by Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, whom they had to get into bed, and when the game was resumed, Air moved ahead with an attempt by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Air, allowed Melrose to take advantage again of having another man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the premises recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for placarding Climo without the balloon, from the penalti line, MacPherson made a test when he was at the back of the maul that was going ahead.
Climate converted him, as he had been doing almost since the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the balloon sent by David Armstrong from a crutches and sent Gregor Henry to the bottom to take the fifth test of the premises.
Still Game's protagonist wants to guide his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move to the restaurant sector after discovering that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is Director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "floating restoration market".
"The sea belongs to us": a Bolivia without coaster has hope that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Marines watch a ship headquarters in La Paz.
In the public buildings there are sea blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by law,
It's a duty to get it back."
In all Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the desire to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a resolution of the International Court of Justice for one October, after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the case of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague tribunal will speak in favour of Bolivia ' s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be obliged to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign sea exit.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who delivers a controversial battle for the reelection next year, also has much to say about Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the resolution of the International Court of Justice is only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have been disrupted in the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
He also suggested that the belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any good Chilean residual will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to keep conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision-making was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use the maritime theme as a political mule.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," she added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we must leave behind the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, says that his nation will never be the first to complete nuclear disarmament if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday to the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments arrive when Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks on a paralysed nuclear field more than three months after this summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and the U.S. opposition to a declaration ending with the Korean War to submit to the north is a "chimera".
Washington is afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament movement.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the delegates.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely protect yourself from the sun, don't look any more.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of large-sized fancy hats for their spring 2019 collection in the gateway, revealing the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wing decorated with feathers that involved the heads of the models.
Other large-sized supplements were sandals with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pine, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter more of them than of the high sewing.
One creation recalled a complete dive team, which included snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted iceberg.
If you like big-size fashion, you're lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
The big hats come on strong footing from "La Bomba", with a hat of straw with a wing over 60 centimeters used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark after this little practical hat that flooded the social networks presented another great creation in the passageway: a beach bag as large as the bathroom model that carried it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia spots and with a white skin axis, was the main piece of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring-summer season 2019 in the Paris Fashion Week.
As noted by the famous Stylist Luke Armitage to FEMAIL: "The next summer, I hope to see huge beach hats and bags on the commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale supplements."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for the citizens of the world
The independent education centres of Scotland have a course of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the examinations that are reinforced by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS, for their English stamps), are trying to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent colleges aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted study plan, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired assignment in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the highest level in the classification tables, being the highest approval rates in independent colleges.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data collected from 74 SCIS centres showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages because they consider them to be a fundamental competition that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, it is considered that, as an assignment, languages are at the same level as CTIM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent colleges and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that, for reasons given by entrepreneurs about the difficulties encountered in covering jobs, 17% were attributed to the lack of linguistic skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
The potential labour opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these competences are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last forever.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from foreign countries will enable that person to automatically advance to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. Also, it was established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If you know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each college will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, independent colleges can always choose from several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this field.
The independent education centres in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this point, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication".
Independent colleges will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Independent Colleges Council
LeBron starts with the Lakers on Sundays in San Diego
The wait for fans who expect to see LeBron James begin their first match with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the opening game of the pre-season that will be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton commented on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell published a tweet that was likely James to play a few minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked by his plans for the six-party pre-term programme of the Lakers.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-time parties to prepare me," he said.
Time of middle Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump launches a series of campaign myths tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation of his candidate to cover the pending vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's myth in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
The Trump myth in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can view it online via a live stream on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump is commenting on the appearances of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who have been harassed by allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have left behind an early vote of confirmation by the Senate during, as many, a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main objective of this series of myths is to help Republicans facing the November elections to take the lead.
Thus, President Trump's campaign pointed out that the next week's five meetings intend to "encourage volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority that remain in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congression control is so crucial to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we enter the campaign," a campaign spokesman from Trump told Reuters that he did not want to give his name.
Programed at the Wesbanco Arena Stadium in Wheeling this evening could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in the Pittsburgh media", as West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate to the Senate of West Virginia, who is being rejected in the polls.
"To Morrisey it's not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows that it dares to fight to keep the hope alive for the individual Sunday parties.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like this.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
"We had six points of advantage and now we have four, so I guess that can be considered a small impulse," Jordan Spieth commented at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel that they have something of wind in favor of and reasons for the rest to be animated, among other reasons by the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and achieved three points of four each.
Spieth has been fatal from tea to green and preach with the example.
The guitar screams of celebration rose as their round moved forward, introducing a vital putt to beat the fourth party when he and Thomas went down two after two days.
The putt he gave them on the 15th was received with a similar shout, from those who reported that he believed the U.S. team had not yet left.
"What needs to be done is to redouble efforts and concentrate on the party," Spieth commented.
That's what these players have done.
18 days to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe has four and four and nothing can get out of them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the last nine days of Friday morning.
That raisin and how its energy flows with the boisterous public make it clear that these are the players to be won on Sunday, and that there will not be other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun is set on Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different days.
Still, it is still premature to speak about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson sent Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, after forming a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine days buried Spanish and Swedish in a hole they couldn't get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no kind of help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them close because they appreciate the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in a moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and brings a great advantage to the last day, but this foursomes session has also shown that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe progresses by 10-6 the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe goes with a good advantage the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 on the United States.
The motivated duo composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in search, moving four points in the Le Golf National classification.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that made many mistakes during the morning's fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the fursomes, winning two matches, but was unable to cut off distances.
US Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual Sunday parties to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the "Molliwood" adage after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, his magnificent union served to defeat a disillusioned Woods and American novel Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, who had not highlighted too much in the two Saturdays, had occasional moments of brightness, but now lost 19 of its 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the fourballs in the morning, became Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three, respectively, with a result of 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwest Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
Three times the winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, getting two points on Saturday.
They achieved an exciting victory 2-1 in front of the Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two initial days.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, that a team recovers from a four-point difference in the individual games has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the trophy owner, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although it has been the best seconds for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack Sunday is beyond its potential.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" that they are first disarmed unilaterally if they do not have confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions had deepened his mistrust in the United States and that there was no possibility of his country giving up nuclear weapons unilaterally under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had adopted " important measures of good will" over the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security, and, in those circumstances, there's no way we're going to disarm ourselves first unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-phase denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, since he did not reject even more unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to mitigate international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, including by objecting to a declaration of war's end," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the US leader to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the interested party in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in a similar stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to lead North Korean missiles to US soil after the "malicious president" Trump, in a suicide mission, was called Kim "man rocket".
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage in advancing towards disarmament, but said that there was still much to do and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set time for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, no matter."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without failure until we realize the final and fully verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed uniform sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for the Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompey spoke with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
It was from Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea reported that its "claims were those of a mobster".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a missile location and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "relevant measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the "relevant measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing Washington relations.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
Thanks to a new course this year at Harvard University, all university students sleep more in an effort to fight the growing masquerade culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the university number one in the world often have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of their class in the United States.
His motivation to launch the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached and asked me why she had just learned about this now, in her last year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of the dream, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of university health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students only slept during the week.
The course of an hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep loss on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, an icon of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that the students' behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that you have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know the effects on tobacco smoking health," added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride for "extinguishing the night in the evening" still exists and added that modern technology and the increased pressure that students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough time and a good-quality dream should be "the secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year in Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it throughout the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study programme before becoming part of the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students think about putting an alarm to go to bed and to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the screens of electric appliances and LEDs, which can alter the circadian rhythms, so they would end up having problems sleeping.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal is to bury Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression out of the house, when Dolly Menga's attack ravaged Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's people wanted to win their first victory out of the house from the 4-1th of February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team at eight points of the Hearts, the leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack took place a few minutes before the middle of the time and the poorly inspired alignment of the Rangers was at no time.
Now, the Rangers go down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third, behind the Hibernian because of the difference of goals.
The Rangers may encounter more problems, as the Calum Spence line judge had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly launched an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard changed to eight of the winners who won the game against Air, entering the semifinals of the Cup of the Scottish League.
For his part, Holt took out the 11 players from Livingston who started a point at Hearts last week and would have rejoiced at the way his organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the balloon when he had it.
They should have marked the two minutes from the start, when Menga took a walk into the space for Scott Pittman who went through the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the middle camper sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep gap for Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in the defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out for the long stick.
The Rangers recovered control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt that he had been punished in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but Arbitrator Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian request.
The Rangers got two doorshots in the first half, but the former porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely seen in trouble to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the target marked in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all predictions, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers didn't know how to deal with a deep play at Jacobs' stand-alone ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed Manga to mark the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, since the pilot passed it to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block it.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the kind of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett throwing a long walk after another.
Holt's men could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a corner of his head that he didn't enter.
The Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the match after a meeting with Jacobs, but, again, Thompson looked elsewhere.
Almac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as Geiger counter.
Count Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Las campaigns de Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in seemingly incompatible roles of Vaquero scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting on the earphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and changes them in the laboratory.
So you can "see" a common protein to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine test is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of different types of cancer", such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking patients' immune cells and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was boarded in a diary for Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was stabbed in the study of Saturday Night Live after an erratic performance in which he praised the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he would be presented to the elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he began deporting against the Democrats and repeating his support for Trump.
"I often talk to someone white and ask myself how I like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have gone from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL launched Matt Damon's sketch program in which Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee regarding the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, comic book Chris Rock went on recording the West Bronze into social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that it had been wrong among the builders to wear that hat.
"They got in with me.
They told me not to go out with the hat.
They got in with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see what sleep I am?" And he added that he was going to "put on his superman coat, because that meant no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
His comments were heard by the public at least two times and the members of SNL seemed ashamed, according to Variety. One person said to the magazine: "The study remained completely silent".
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-con, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West disillusioned many when he went out on stage to sing I Love it dress like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GRAYS TO RESIST TO MUCHEDUMBRE".
Karen Hunter, presenter of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I decide NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes, or by supporting their art) who I think is hugging and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed, saying it was now "the person previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, which changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Murder attempt charge for stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday at the Belfast Court of First Instance.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of Thrones Game, attacks toxic malehood
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Nieve in the violent series of medieval fantasy of the HBO, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the male hero's stereotype, saying that these screen roles often transmitted to young boys who had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview given to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in the Tronos Game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that it seemed "very important" to him to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems quite important to me at this moment, where have we made mistakes with masculinity?" he commented.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television can be part of the responsibility for increasing male toxicity due to its so male characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they need to be this particular form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in any precule or sequel of the Thrones Game when the series ended next summer, claiming that it is "hard of battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will stage True West, Sam Shepard's theatre work that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever taken out of the Thrones Game.
"I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she gave me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Nieve, in the fantastic award-winning series with Emmy awards.
The couple got married in June 2018 in a family farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports more than 14 per cent of new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which implies a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of persons contracted in this way has been reduced in its overall practice, the Chinese health authorities declared at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by around 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality occurred in China in 1997, but the collective LGTB suffered much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of men who maintain sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to lack of adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff is filtering data from senators of the Republican Party and believes that it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters criticised the allegations that a member of his staff had published the personal data of three United States senators of the Republican Party on the Wikipedia page on legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that these charges were driven by commentators and websites of "extreme right".
"False, lie and more evil lies," Waters commented on a Twitter post.
The information reported included addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Chapter published the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration was carried out at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Chapter.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was for nothing responsible for the filtering of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
The Waters statement raised immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"Destroy this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it is not the templar necessary to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get mad.
You mustn't rebel.
You must not question the accused's motives.
It must remain calm and serene."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Water's reaction to the critics of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of being too angry during Thursday's appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to un-bank Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned "the relevant authorities and entities responsible for enforcing the law of these fraudulent charges".
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Criticism by Johnny English: Again in action. Rowan Atkinson's spy parody is short
Now it has become a tradition to search for guides to Brexit in any new film with a British approach. This seems to be what it is to do with this new delivery of the parody frankity of action and comedy Johnny English, who started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satisfaction about the clearly disbanded fact that we are the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes and his unexpressive face, has renewed his license to put the duck for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than nothing, it is a comical creation intended for non-English speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, it's the ridiculous secret agent that, despite his strange claims to tear down glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a piece of that kind that played a single note on the subject of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Moreover, in its origin it was based on the mysterious traveling and international man represented by Atkinson years ago in the already forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard, sowing chaos after him.
In this last delivery, there is one or two good moments.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor while the helicopters were crashing against the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but humor remains rather short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that "series" franchises like 007 and impossible Mission add comic ingredients without problems.
Humour seems more directed towards children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as ingenious and correct as Atkinson's silent jokes in Mr. Bean's role.
Now, the repeated argument today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has been infiltrated into the supersecret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all its agents in active presence in the presence of the agent in service, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pumping and corroborated character that is seeing how its political popularity sinks: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for work.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as all spies are in danger, you will have to resort to someone who is withdrawn.
This has to be the Johnny English torpedoes, which now teaches in a bad college, although it gives extra-official classes about how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as this is a spy academy like that of the Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his former compinche Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice paper for which Vicki Pepperdine is not used enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous traps of a multi-million-dollar charismatic technology world that claims he can solve the computer problems of Britain: sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hatred of absurd situations: they dress up from comrades, they catch fire at an elegant French restaurant, they expose chaos hiding in the luxury yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes a pure anarchy when trying to use a helmet of virtual reality to get familiar with the inside of the house of Volta.
Definitely, they were thoroughly used in that last sequence, but, however funny and concise, the whole continues to convey a feeling of a little childish.
A pretty regular product.
Like the other films by Johnny English, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do real justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but covers five
Jeremy Corbyn's Laborist Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but would charge five.
The party is supposed to want the owners of the companies to target the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same wage.
According to the sources, the idea of "encouraging" in the plans and the party's economic agenda of tilting the country to the interests of the workers is indicated.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take part in the changing economy.
As a high-ranking Labour Party commented on The Sunday Times: An announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"You will not get from one day to another, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter that the party expects to incorporate to rebalance the economy for the worker, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this kind of idea, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, for the time being, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A spokesman for the workers said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
Hacienda's shadow minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference that was held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "exploited" from companies providing public services.
The Minister's plans in the shade also include the idea that current water companies' shareholders do not recover their full participation, as a labor government could apply deductions that correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include employees in company management boards and to create inclusive ownership funds where 10 per cent of private-sector business shares should be allocated to employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation around Kavanaugh and if I could make them change their mind
The investigation by the FBI on charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for confirmation as a judge of the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the results that are concluded could affect any republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be held on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham talk about whether the FBI could bring out information that would change their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than her colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I was in favour of the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, and the claim came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, resolute, secretive."
Graham's vote, however, seems unbearable.
"I already have a decision taken around Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she appoints have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it been able to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star cartel is gathered for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances like that of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to realize the real objective of the event: to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness-raising group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
If you wish to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay a VIP entry), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteers, send e-mails to a world leader, make a telephone call or anything else that serves to realize their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizens achieved at 12 years of age to reach their goal?
The idea of rewarding with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to take action or not more than a form of so-called "clitivism", which is called the attitude that we adopt when we believe we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favour of a large number of different goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have been able to have global leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2250 million people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments are "The Power of Nutrition", an association of UK-based investors and contractors combined with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with their full potential". To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
"Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and partners of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small hit in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after conducting more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard path and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights movements have already achieved before and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the events we will have at the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Army to block Russian energy exports - Secretariat of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington could use its Army to prevent Russian energy from plundering markets, including the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, as published in Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates in legitimate government bodies, is no more than a pretext for expansion in new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the most supplier in southern Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Armed Forces, has the capacity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke was addressed to people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared Washington's approaches in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they were, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels," he warned at the same time that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its natural gas to Europe and to highlight its role as Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a Moscow Rhine.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is worth $11 billion and is expected to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 11 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project only responds to economic reasons and is a more unfair display of competition.
"I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the Secretary of Energy of the United States, last September in Moscow.
The U.S. position, however, has been found with the rejection of Germany, who has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization leading the industry in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a great problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyze the possibility of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would study the possibility of joining the presidential career after the elections to half the term.
During an appearance in the Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
"It is time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally to have women among the leaders," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting myself as a candidate for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Town Hall and stated that he was "carrying the country along the wrong path".
"I'm really worried about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke with no applause about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Friday tweet, Warren said "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
A survey was published on Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that it should be presented for the 2020 elections.
58 per cent of Massachusetts's "possible" voters said the senator should not appear, according to the survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
However, 32% of the respondents supported their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the potential candidate for 2020 of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide on it in January, as the Associated Press agency reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin in a myth of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enrolled in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The situation that has been going through my son, through everything that has happened since he came back, is well known by the other families who suffer from the effects of TEPT and other injuries that our soldiers are returning with," he told the public that he met in a mitin in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering whether there really exists that respect for what their soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, who interfered with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of achieving a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Colombia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" letter in Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum-seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant has not been disclosed in the case "Grace v. Sessions" presented in August by the US Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy.
He said that his "and his children, who are members of a violent gang", abused her, but US officials refused his asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as nations facing widespread domestic and gang violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision taken by the Migration Appeals Board (BIA, for its English stamps) by which undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday saying that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
"According to federal legislation, all applications for asylum must fail under the particular facts and circumstances of the request and, on the other hand, this exception violates that principle," says the friend curiae.
Lawyers also indicated in writing that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the economy of the United States by claiming that they often become entrepreneurs more often and "supply a necessary working hand".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or a particular political opinion may apply for asylum," said Sessions when this Directive was announced last June 11.
Asylum has never been created as a means of eradicating all the problems, not even all the serious problems, to which people around the world face daily.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths increases in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to comfort her baby with fever in an evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And the water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their homes destroyed to search out the few property they have left behind in an effort to recover as much as possible.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged due to magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had his back and a broken shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continuous replicas, also very strong.
I couldn't help crying when I told us the violent earthquake he lived on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to make ourselves safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the ruined wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of doing "bullying" with "propagandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China's Daily payment supplement at the Des Moines Register, Iowa's most-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the United States Congress of 6 November, something China has consistently denied.
The accusation that Trump made about Beijing's attempt to influence US elections marked what US officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in imports by both parties.
The Chinese countervailing tariffs applied to the beginning of the trade war were thought to come back to state exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad in an opinion article at the Des Moines Register Sunday, China is "intensifying even more that pressure with advertisements in our free press."
"To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is worth the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press when trying to publish a payment ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the kiosk of the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few shocking voices and no real reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have on the worrying trajectory that is taking the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant journals has failed to publish" his article, although he did not specify what journal it was.
Analysts point out that Republicans are distanced from women before the half-legislatorial vote with the debacle of Kavanaugh
As many renowned Republicans are closing ranks in favour of the candidate to the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court in the face of the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there may be a backlog, especially by women, in the next half-legislatorial elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have expressed their desire to proceed with the vote.
"In this kind of matter it is not possible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to stand in favour of the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm down the dissatisfied voters on this issue.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered at the Senate doors were saying "November is coming!" (November will soon arrive!) when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats comes from all prognosis," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say that the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the indecisive women of the neighborhoods of the outside and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who do not usually vote even though they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he contained all the details of his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that there could be a resurgence if Republicans continued to confirm.
"This matter has become a big joke for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is no longer just a question of the committee's vote or the final vote, even if they sit in the bench at Kavanaugh; it is also the way Republicans have handled all this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, US Priorities Director (a group that helps in the election of Democrats).
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although they are a few more who stand aside from the latter.
A new YouGov survey indicates that 41% of respondents definitively or probably create Ford’s testimony, while 35% claim to believe Kavanaugh definitively or probablely.
In addition, 38% said he thought that Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of the other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her by being drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed, for his part, that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed her genitals at a party when she studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is about to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the legend of technology. A company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open-source Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "on-line personal data storage" or a POD.
You can include lists, pending to-dos lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
Something that is, however, exclusive in the storage of personal data online is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's general director John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills needed for Solid to reach the whole world.
Currently, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that purchased IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a volunteer programming community.
From this week on, technological developers from around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a radical change where all their business models are completely modified from day to day.
"We're not going to ask for permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Clergy Who Won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a Cross Victoria during World War I as a fighter has been honored in their hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and I never knew that he had been granted the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, their two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone and a show in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made his grandfather deserve decoration.
According to London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "passing through a thick fog and under the intense fire of ametherometers and cannons".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the "most bravery", made the line advance before he reached a cannon with one hand and dropped to three of the stands.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann killed him by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions he carried out by his grandfather were "so great that I will never be able to reach his height, but they were very lecturing."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the show, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was all a privilege for him to be part of the show" and added that "the value of an authentic hero is patented when it is shown so many support".
MMA followers were awake all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay awake all night to see all the Bellator 206 so they won't finally let you see the main event.
The San José cartel had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the United Kingdom it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, the United Kingdom television viewers remained attuned when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised when they had to wake up until the first hour of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as "a heavy joke".
"There is a government regulation that regulates the content issued from 6 a.m. and this was inadequate, so they had to change the programming of children," said Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communication vice president of Bellator, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Peppa la verdita", yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he was going to change the program to include British spectators in the next editions.
"When I think about the option of retransmission, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's 6:00 in the morning on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our hour, which would already be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming changed, a lot of messages were received and not everyone was kind, exactly.
We're trying to fix it, because at first we think it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise you next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are what we have usually done. We try to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumph.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn't realize until he came to the high school that "they weren't all like me."
In the first program of Desert Island Radio Discs 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to convey "hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him begin to remain important in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months because of illness.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalist, commented that he felt "less" to the rest during his childhood, because "he was not socially accepted that you liked children and girls".
He said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has really given me the power and strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he was not disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games this year held in Australia to claim that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to convey that "hope" to others.
The three times champion of the world declared that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner last year, who has been 20 years, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you've lived so long since you were so young" (he was at his first 14-year-old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same tall and low as you.
The couple had a son in June who they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is, of course, Robbie."
His son is called his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and actually one of the last things he asked is if they had the steps for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I wasn't able to tell you that I wasn't going to be in the first row," he said.
"I had his hand between my hands when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that very moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible," he commented.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that time I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of me in Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also what inspired him to choose his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still wearing chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low shape, stayed in the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th party of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad hit.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years for a 12th time record, was fired by Captain Furik for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as many times it has done for the United States, the five times the major tournament champion had to conform to cheering in some moments and, in others, to try to perfect his game in the field and thus be able to correct what troubles him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, not even at the highest moment of their career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough is constantly punishing with wrong hits.
And if the field is no longer sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the brilliant British Open Champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debuter Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below when starting the 12 individual parties, started in an impressive way, the Mickelson party might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his companion, nor could he say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role he had today, gave me a palm in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is in the Famous Hall and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's brand of more games played by the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cups trajectory that had never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 losings and 7 equal ones, although Furik said his presence brought much more tangible values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to joke about others; it's great to have it on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players have loved to have it as support this week, too; it was fun.
It brings much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 Valderrama party, where a band captained by Seven Ballesters maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but in the end only succeeded in ending the others by treading the heels on a minimum margin, winning 1411⁄2-131.2.
"You don't stop remembering that we made a big tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brooklyn and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but very little," said Bjorn, retired, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone that this team is not over.
You have to give it all morning.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, more or less, than the best players in the world."
Proud of what their players have done in a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to advance.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, try all your skills as a golfer.
That's the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best out of the same morning.
Now, leave your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do it better individually than they did as a couple, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
The same Furyk has been at both extremes in the last days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team he won in Brooklyn and then ended up losing when Europe took over the "Milagro de Medinah".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When we all move forward in one direction, all the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
We assigned Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I was with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole trip," Bjorn said about their individual selections.
The new German warship, seconded again
The new Fragate of the German Navy should have been tasked in 2014 to replace the old Cold War ships, but will not be done at least the year that comes due to faulty systems and the progressive increase in costs, the local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new Fragates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine, a statement by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery delayed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four boats of the Baden-Württemberg class that requested the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frogs.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-bullet missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar signals, infrared and very low acoustics.
Among other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project their power at the sea) to be obsolete when they start to serve, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate occupied headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It's been the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media quoted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, since the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the staff in the former Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship had an excessive burden, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the 7000-tonnes Rhineland-Palatinate is twice as heavy as other similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also posed a problem.
It is believed that it has reached €31 billion ($3600 million), instead of the initial €22 billion.
The problems attributed to the new fractures are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of the naval power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Army is "remaining without ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that the problem had worsened over time, because the old boats had been given low, but they had not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frogs could join the Navy.
The National Trust spys on the secret life of turtles
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to find out how the Murcielagos use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything is expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano reefs, as well as the daubenton coastal reefs and long ear browns of the Inverewe gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
The NHS template and volunteers will also carry out mobile research with portable detectors.
The experts will analyze the sounds gathered in the recordings to discover the frequency of the mulciellague calls and what species do they do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, expects the results to reveal what habitat areas are most important to the mosquitoes and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be maintained for turtles and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, there has been a considerable reduction in the number of mollusc populations in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical cables may also pose a risk to them, as well as insecticides and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cats.
Murciellas are not really blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the theme of the Murcielagas very seriously.
He has ten trained experts in the field, who are dedicated to carrying out regular surveys, nest inspections and, at times, rescues.
The organization has opened even the first and only reserve dedicated to Scottish shellfish in the state of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scottish shellfish.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a fantastic area for turtles," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the proper habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about the turtles, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of checking whether there were shellfish before carrying out maintenance tasks within the property, as an involuntary breeding colony could be destroyed and 400 females and females could be killed, which would result in the destruction of the entire local population.
Murcielagos are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them, as well as to destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about turtles and many other species about which we do not know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers are persecuting the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has cataloged allegations of rape as "fake news", and says that people "want to get to know" on the coast of their name.
His lawyers had received instructions to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
In front of Portugal and Juventus, he is accused of violating a US woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having paid $375 000 to hide the incident, as Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With a video from Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news, Ronaldo, 33 years old, hit the report like "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false," says the winner of the Golden Ball five times looking at the camera.
"They only want publicity on the coast of my name.
It's always the same story.
They want to make themselves famous by just mentioning me, but that's how I can't avoid it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a claim to Der Spiegel for the charges that appear in what they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player will try to obtain compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious crimes of his personal rights in recent years".
It seems that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly violated it annually, according to documents registered in the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo was surrounded after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had been defrauded by that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consented to.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she had "terror in reprisals" and was concerned about "to be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is trying to cancel the agreement, as it continues to be traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to Juve, a big Italian football for a contract of €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret all its life" if it lost its position as world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK reported to the BBC that, if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, production would temporarily be stopped at its Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of delays in customs in the case of an unagreed Brexit could lead to loss of work.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Auris and Avensis models from Toyota, produced about 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain breaks up with the EU at the end of March, there will be production fairs in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have shown their fears about the EU's exit without an agreement, especially with regard to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns referred to by car manufacturers revolve around the problems that could arise in the assembly chains in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted production mode (‘just in time’ or at the last moment), where the pieces arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to manufacture cars for charge.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement, there could be a break at the border which, according to the sector, could cause delays and dissatisfaction.
For Toyota it would be impossible to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than one inventory day on its Derbyshire plant, the company said and, if so, the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the Theresa May Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "precisely calibrated to avoid such controls in border crossings".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we need to take advantage of the opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today 4.
"The evidence of Toyota, among other things many manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a set of tremendously successful supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union on the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "As my experience shows, once these jobs are lost, they never recover."
A spokesperson for the government said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan to limit our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy General Rod Rosenstein could "send another week", as he continued the debate on the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump and Russia's aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation before Trump decides to fire the deputy general or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fed Washington's knives for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone that he himself carried to try to untie the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, among news where he said he was about to give up.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (at that time in the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to postpone a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday in Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been defined, it could be this week or it could be another one, considering everything that's going on with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will inform the press, as usual."
Some journalists would refute that statement: Sanders has not carried out any press rounds in the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of press wheels was not due to a diversion to TV journalists who were acting with bigotry, although he said, "I won't disagree with the fact that they're fanfarronian."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President conducts more questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, while quoting without proof: "We have contrasted these numbers."
The press wheels will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of directly asking the President of the United States, I think it's much better than doing them to me.
We've tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press wheel when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press wheels with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week in New York, the president showed why it was so, where he made an angry appearance and, at times, bizarrely, in front of the journalists who were gathered there.
The State Health Secretary writes to the EU workers of the NHS Scotland about their fear of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU template working in Scotland's HHS to express the country's gratitude and its desire to follow them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter only six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit in which it was chosen to take the decisions expected this fall have been followed.
However, the UK Government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which it would not agree.
I know this must be very confusing for you.
And that is why I would like to reiterate now how much the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality, is worth.
Professionals from all over the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count with you."
Christion Abercrombie is operating urgently after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, a player of the Tennessee State Tigers, was surgically emergency after suffering a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, told Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, informed reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the band and went off right there," Reed said.
Both the trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before putting it on a bed and taking it to a deep examination.
A member of the Tennessee State template told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in its first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five pickles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the entire season.

The increase in the tax on the transfer of land will be imposed on those persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to the "no roof"
The additional money collected with the increase in the land transfer tax to foreign buyers of properties in the United Kingdom will be used for aid to the "no roof", Theresa May announced today.
The measure is meant as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and host voters who have higher incomes.
The increase in land tax will be recorded for people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and that money will be used to encourage government policy to combat the problem of medicity in the streets.
The charge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase at levels introduced two years ago on second-hand dwellings and the buy-to-let system, could amount to up to 3 %.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's new construction properties are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which causes price increases and makes it difficult for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's most densely populated areas (especially in capital) have become "phantom cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping very high prices in the properties by buying greedily land without intending to use it and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the contributions that apply to affordable housing to solve the "disgusting problem of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn had announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of the evictions without cause.
It also proposes to grant the local authorities more power to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said I would devote my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of each new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, are able to buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland coach says his "primordial goal" is to become Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is delusional in view of the possibility of revitalizing the club in the northeast, which currently holds the third position in the League One (the third league division of England), at three points in the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren again to the Scottish Premier last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," Ross told Sportssound on BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child and it's something he's always done that he wants to come back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I succeed in running a club."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's leader are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any fear when he passed names so established in such a big club, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"At this point, the success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club correspond, without a doubt, to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only think that I've achieved my goal here when I can get back to the club where I should be."
Ross has only been practicing as a coach for three years, after being an assistant in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the technical body of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren pass from being on the edge of the descent to win the championship in the next season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably an authentic crossroads," he recalled, referring to when the Alloa was commissioned.
"I always thought the direction was what was best for me, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I could win my life very well with it and enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of this work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I've always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the age of my adult life in which I feel better, no doubt."

According to one survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon
The heat wave of the summer has boosted profits in British pubs that struggle to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Pubs and bars groups saw how their sales increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while the profits of restaurants dropped by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA's consulting office, which was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England continues in the world have still made it possible to maintain the pattern of the previous month of June, in which the pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although the restaurants have dropped even more.
The fall of 1.8% in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly food also suffered from heat, although not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the managed bars and pubs, the sales of beverages rose to 6.6% during the month, while the food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM's host and leisure analysts, said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors with regard to sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the fall of 4.8% in sales compared to last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the ongoing cost pressures.
The long and warm summer could not have come at a worse time for gastronomic operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand installations.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which supervises sales in the UK’s restaurants, bars and pubs sector, the performance data of 47 operating groups are collected and analysed, with a combined billing of more than £9 billion and is the market reference value.
One in five children has secret accounts on social networks behind their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years of age) have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents and teachers, as a survey reveals
The survey, conducted at 20,000 high school students, revealed growth on Instagram's false pages.
News has exacerbated the fear that sexual content will be published
About 20% of students claimed to have a "principal" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years of age) create accounts on social networks that hide adults.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in Instagram's false accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has exacerbated the fear that sexual content will be published.
A 20 per cent of the students said they had a healthy "principal" account that showed their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who was found by chance with the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violarize" me.
The research conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent colleges found that 40% of children aged 11-18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Eilid Doyle has been elected to be part of the Scottish Sports Federation Directive as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most talented athlete in the track and field of Scotland and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim that sport will benefit from its great international experience in the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland will benefit greatly from counting on it in its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I like to be the spokesman for athletes and I hope I can contribute things and help develop sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the four gold he won and is now a usual expert on BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would do it.
It's been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I'm doing agility exercises right now.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the bagels where it is compared to mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A company has divided public opinion over the Internet with an ad comparing it to mothers who breast-feed cows they order.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "first silent extracts of the world", the technology company for consumer Elvie published an ad inspired in a video with something ironic music where mothers are shown to have the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four real women dance in a haystack full of dancing, along with some cows, with letters like, "Yes, I order myself alone, but I don't have a tail" and "Because if you haven't noticed it, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The choir continues to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, order my women."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77 000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say that they can focus on the "horrors" of the milk sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth in order to produce milk, except that they remove their babies from their days after they stop," wrote one person.
The Elvie milk extractor is discreetly adapted to a lactator (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Troumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a mother's milk extractor that they will stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "Let's go an ad more horseed."
Other people, however, defended the ad, as a woman who admitted that the song was "disturbing".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd probably have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt completely like a cow.
The ad is a little overrated, but I'm not giving it back.
It's a product genius," a woman told us.
Another person commented: "It's a funny announcement addressed to mothers who use a baby bomb (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither commends nor condemns the milk sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women showed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the subjects.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who are milked with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, it has no cables or tubes, and is quietly attached within the breast restraint, which makes its users able to move, subject their babies and even walk out the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD, comments: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, we intended to draw attention to the use of infant bombs and their challenges, while demonstrating in a entertaining and close manner the incredible sense of freedom that the new bomb offers.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded through the passageway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minor immigrants discreetly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of minor detainees has experienced a significant increase, despite the fact that monthly fluctuation at the border has practically been maintained at the usual levels, partly due to the rhetorical toughness and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicated by the possibility of parading these children.
Traditionally, most of the peasants, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that the fact of proposing to host a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior member of the Office of Immigration and Customs, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought out unaccompanied minors.
The Agency confirmed after 70 per cent of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of the sponsors or their relatives are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a maximum period of one month from the time of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the workers of the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by video conference, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered fit for the amparo shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers of the reception centres and reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain under surveillance, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent abductions or attempted flight.
According to defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of abuse are ignored in these children.
Moreover, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria requests the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the country ' s war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and that the topic "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the topic of refugees, Moualem stated that adequate conditions were given for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made the refugees decide to stay away from the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a detention area in the last major rebel base of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had "clear spaces" and has expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the combatants of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will "be eradicated".
Mixture staff, a special UN envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win the reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will probably expect, a destitution or a scandal prematurely terminate their presidency.
This would certainly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
There are currently no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the peak attendance rates have doubled to CNN 1.05 million and have almost tripled to MSNBC 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC has exceeded the cable channel indexes with 3.5 million viewers for the main night news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we haven't understood yet," comments Neal Baer, author-producer of "Designed Survivor", a dramatic series of the ABC on a cabinet secretary that becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", he has another theory.
Remembers a taxi trip he made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why? He asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos are always up in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe Case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families can meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that can only allow the most privileged spectators.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you have six hours of experience seeing a panel of experts discussing the use of the sources of "deep background" that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's stellar leather hunter ("an unbalanced pride suit", in The Washington Post's words) and the implications of the slender descriptions of Stormy Daniels of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's part of what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", when he talks about the alternate division of Trump's show and his daily shifts of the plot (whether going into a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to lose an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a sunny day of 27 degrees on the northern coast of Kaui, but he was refugees inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get rid of the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when in those days we did all those crazy programs and people told us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss says.
"I thought it was all a joke, but it finally turned out they were right."

The external money flows into the most adjusted half-term elections of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the cash flow is coming to the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional district with two candidates seeking reelection for the same stage.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose structure is recently redesigned, has Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that is largely devastated with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The career for the new 17 has triggered a funding content for the campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for Congressional District 18 of Pennsylvania.
That scene had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, although after being thrown back
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a pleasant meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the management team of the Trump Organisation.
Officials of the Department of State decided to return to the heads of the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decisions to stop recognition of Taiwan", said Heather Naurut, the spokesman of the department, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to punish El Salvador, which had already received some US$ 140 million in 2017 for, among other things, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts to financial assistance and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid immigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials of the administration made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, which would put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence intends to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, as diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three US envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
The Study of History
The next planned step could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump ' s justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public register.
It is believed that Mueller is also carrying out research into the possibility that Trump's campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to present himself again to the voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and I therefore do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the Consensus.
In 1938, German officials were ready to give a coup d'état against Hitler. It was only necessary that the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of butchery that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these inflexible points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been seen in a good way since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his incapacity for office.
Rosenstein says the explanation of The Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his office is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections a Congress that will report to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will find ourselves in a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I don't think we're going to fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath at the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans de los Rangers, optimist in front of the meeting against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive pampering in Spain against the Villareal in the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to be classified in Group G of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented the media camper Graham Dorrans from reaching their first appearance of the season until the 2nd to 2nd against the Villareal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point, because the Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the party believing that we could get something and get out with a point.
We may have achieved victory at the end, but in general the empathy may have been a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the rest we went out for everyone and were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult party because they have already achieved a good result in the previous party, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now a general environment is noticeable that everything will work out well.
The team is fine, the boys are enjoying a lot and we're having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
Fear of retirement savings is making some women lose their sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about this with their relatives.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this.
"People want a family to take care of them, but they're not taking steps to have this conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determining factor of the cost.
It incorporates into the conversion to its financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay for that expenditure.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with value in cash to help you cover your expenses or ensure yourself with your own savings, provided that you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of legal battles.
Take care to obtain a medical care power to designate a trusted person who supervises medical care and ensures that professionals meet their own wishes in case they cannot be communicated.
It can also prepare a notary power for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his or her behalf and make sure that his or her bills are paid if he or she is incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it will always be up to you.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors need to be treated with?" Martin asked.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's got to be all planned."
Shooting a man several times with a cab in Ilfracombe
They shot a man several times with a car while he was walking home after going out at night.
The victim, a man about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
Their injuries are not fatal, and the police have made a call to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
With blocked communications, assistance officers have not been able to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a regent that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regiment, which is an administrative region hierarchically inferior to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they focus mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Dongala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Zone, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Indonesia caused a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were killed in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
There were hundreds of casualties on the island of Nias, opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6,8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic recalling the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time it caused no tsunamis, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.

The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to that police report, when a well-known officer tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he removed the phone.
Palin has been sentenced to preventive prison in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained with an unsecured guarantee of $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he was declared " definitively innocent" when his statement was requested, he informed the chain.
Palin faces three minor offences of Class A, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a lesser crime than Class B, with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska vet court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, interference in the complaint of a domestic violence crime and possession of an embryonic weapon in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had said she gave him a fist in her face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her child's violent behavior with the post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, located north-east of Yakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social networks and that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the capital punishment for Sayfillo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack last October on a bicycle car on the West Side motorway of Lower Manhattan, ravaging pedestrians and cyclists who were on their way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intended" caused serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intention to apply for a death penalty, presented in the South District of New York.
The two charges involve a possible death penalty, according to the court record.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury filed a charge to Saipov for 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with the help of organized crime, which are often used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and devious".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is specified in the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the South District of New York processed a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to watch ISIS videos on his phone for his attack.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be erected in his hospital room, the police said.
The charge of 22 counts has been declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a declaration of guilt with a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously requested prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
MEP Tory says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
UKIP's former leader said politicians had to "feel the warmth" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in the Birmingham concentration that the United Kingdom "would have left" if Farage had been Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May in reconciling his divided ranks has highlighted even more when a group of Tories for the sake of permanence have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitment plan signed in Chequers in the midst of the attacks of the Brexit supporters, their opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force the Eurosceptic and Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
MEP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left," he said.
This Member of Parliament by Wellingborough added: "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions that the public had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and that we want to remain in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkins was also in the concentration, where he said to reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favour and is not popular between our party and our activists, who actually go out on the streets and vote first.
Forget the Cheques and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: The prime ministers keep their duties when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the concentrates that it would be necessary to "sensitize heat" to politicians if they saw that they were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them out with theirs."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory over Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the supporters of the stay traveled the streets of Birmingham before half an hour in the city center.
Some activists used Tories Against Brexit's banners after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives for the security problems they had with party implementation during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus, for the borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of presenting himself to the presidency
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "consider all the possibilities of presenting himself for the presidency" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been widely speculated about the possibility that Warren is facing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took over the post.
An assistant asked him if he had planned to present himself for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington to settle our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the highest level".
Arrested by the LSU Sims player firearm murder
Baton Rouge (Luisiana) police announced this Saturday that a suspect was arrested for shooting Wayde Sims, LSU's basketball player last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old Diteon Simpson's arrest at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who is seen in the video.
Yes, 20 years of age, he was shot near the Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head that finally caused his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday for 247 sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been on the scene of the crime, in possession of a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and detained in the police department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Yes, an original player from Baton Rouge 1.98 meters high, played in 32 games last season, having ten of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after team orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the time that Valtteri Bottas was classified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was made clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position on the first two turns and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter boxes and let Hamilton run in the group queue, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out hard later and set himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved after an action with almost stuck wheels that made the Ferrari pilot badly want to leave the free interior at risk of resisting after a double movement to defend himself on the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, started from the last row of the grill and was placed in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race as he got close to his tires to achieve a quick finish and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he went into boxes in round 44, but couldn't increase his pace in the eight remaining rounds by restoring Raikkonen's fourth position.
It's been a hard day because Valteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when I let it happen.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That has been a really bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein on a Saturday for his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the nomination for the Supreme Court.
Speaking in a myth in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ford to the Senate Judicial Committee, but rather commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, disgusting and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and the filters, and then they say, "But if I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't filtered it," he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied the coming filtration of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and therefore did."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who, during the middle of Saturday night, commented: "I will tell you one thing: that has been a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense against the appointment of the Supreme Court, which had been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to recover power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the abhorrence, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control," the president said, according to Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the victory on Friday at the Elite League in front of the Belfast Giants when winning the game back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial two-goal advantage thanks to the attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local empath before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal arrived in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to assistance from Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford provided assistance for Beauvilier to double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very animated initial period, Sullivan again put the local team to play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to equal the match at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants would take advantage of before the first rest when he scored his second night's goal at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a hunger at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the leader for the first time in the party when the end of the second party arrived and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as the end approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home before Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane of the earthquake
A Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people was able to safely disembark.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to hit the area and many are trapped among the trash in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport control tower.
He remained firm to ensure that Batik Air, which was on the track at that time, could safely disembark.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirat said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian channel ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach several thousand people. The national disaster relief agency states that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and could not be contacted with many people," comments Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
The water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Aerial accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the air accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a male passenger could not be seen from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that they had moved seven people to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers continued on Saturday at the hospital and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The air carrier and the United States Army said the plane landed in the lagoon before the track.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the landing track.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane got very low.
"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes notes that he and other passengers managed to advance through a water that reached their belt to the emergency exits of the plane that began to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and yelled, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Army said that the sailors who carried out approximately one mill improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the aviation security network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents of air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor completed the presentation of his arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning alive to a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used his mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old accused, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up the road on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lieting, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they only met a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"The eraser of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held by the jury that very day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill your music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that the hip hop left behind its roots of political messages and to deal with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hip hop conscious to be popular again.
Interpreters such as The Refugees and Common have seen a recent resurrection in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New Yorker asks a couple to fire her after a "racist" text
A New Yorker is going to claim a couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received a mother's text message incorrectly complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with an "extortion" case.
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two children, expressed her dismay at discovering that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she was sent to Maurice twice.
After learning about his leg measurement, a "convenient" Plasco-Faxman fired Maurice saying that his former child, who was an African American, had done a bad job and that he was waiting for a Filipino instead, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for one day's work and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now requesting compensation from the couple for dismissal in order to receive compensation of $350 a day for the position of six months of domestic work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't do that," he told The Post on Friday and added that "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they were racist saying that the end of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the demand as an "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months before and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to get someone like that?
That's not that it's a very decent thing," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still in progress, the public opinion court has been seized of reporting to the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put in the place of someone who read it for the first time before her publication.
Thank you very much for knowing now what we know about Paddington's great success."
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before he was inspired into a toy to write the book for children, trusted that his work would be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "agridulce" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to assume," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something important: you're proud of him, even though he wasn't really worthy of you.
I think he saw the success of Paddington that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Upon landing, her daughter was urgently transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nothing regularly called to say that the situation was really bad, which was not expected to succeed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep the pumping of their heart were slowly exhausted and left their system.
She had died before time and everything was turning off.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't study or cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay firm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane next to the other passengers, outside of the terrible experience she was experiencing.
"No one knew," he said.
"I looked at my head and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her."
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis's son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up anywhere."
However, he quit his job before he died, since he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he died.
Ms. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that I can have an impact."
Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people you can go to and with who you can talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't be silent, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after her mother died.
"You didn't say you'd feel depressed or anything like that," he tells us.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed her change of attitude.
Christmas day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he did not even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: "Let a void in the whole family.
He's left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on a thread when the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we could really get something like what I was asking (a limited research in time, limited scope), we could perhaps bring some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "during the peak" in the midst of a partialist paralysis.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI's investigation to be carried out?
Their negativity is entirely due to chronology.
Only five weeks are missing for the mid-term elections, on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their efforts to achieve the election of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The figures of North Korean deserters "caen" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-one came into power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said that last year there were 1,127 deserts, compared with 2,706 of 2011.
Park said that the tightest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs charged by traffickers have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this.
The vast majority of North deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seúl says that they have illegally crossed the border of more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers the deserters to be illegal immigrants instead of refugees and is often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed in general to work on a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without US confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will in no way be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says it's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority of the House of Representatives, said that the appointment to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "historic" and that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday in the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin (Texas).
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said it was hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was moved to deny the allegations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost shouting and attracted as he spoke about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats , qualifying the charges against them of "great and clearly coordinated defamation" organised by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that this could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed its bias against the Democrats.
"I think he's devaluing himself with those statements with and how he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi made his objections when asked if he would object to Kavanaugh in case he was confirmed in office and that the Democrats had obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won't be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, you won't even be in the court where you are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Circuit Appeals Tribunal.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible sentences against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to feel all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to push it.
It's a justified diatribu, it's months and years of rage coming over, and she can't let him go without crying.
"We wept when we got angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?"
She kept saying, "I was very much helped by a woman who was executive in some company and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but who had developed a technique that when she was angry and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to: "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
Well, no, I'm angry."
And then I went on with what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first works, in an office dominated by men, was once I found myself crying with an unexpressable anger. A older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cogoon and dragged me to a staircase.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've saved you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was picked up on an extramarriage adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business, he had to withdraw from the presidential career, to Schroeder, deeply frustrated, he found that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would present herself for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," he said 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone referred to us as Blancaneives and the seven Enanites."
As the campaign was already very advanced, it remained behind in the fundraising process, so it was promised that it would not enter the race again unless it had raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he delivered his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration for a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the capture of voters instead of delegates, and anger towards sexism), which he caught up with.
"The logic would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis," Schroeder said, recalling the press' reaction.
"You might have thought that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you gonna put on my rock?
"Weeping"?"
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first survivors of the trade war between the United States and China were insurmountable, and although much remains to be done to end the battle, a break-up between countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning early in the year by putting tariffs on the main Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $20 billion (15 billion pounds) in products, with half of the products entering the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has taken equivalent rebates, recently applying five to ten per cent tariffs to US products at a value of $6 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will soon come to an end.
To achieve Washington's return would mean surrendering to the demands, but to submit publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing played its cards well, the pressures of the United States trade war could help China positively in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make it possible to start a drop in the economy in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than what spectators have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asian topics for the Strategic Office Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been in existence for more than seven years.
In a speech earlier to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the country ' s conditions were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods are already in place.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are another six million people who still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe deals with the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 when defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States now has six consecutive European soil victories since it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, threw his point of exit to the water in the 16 pair 3 hole, thus admitting his defeat before Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari highlighted in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the start of the current format of the tournament in 1979.
US Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 before the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 in front of the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became a European with the most winnings of the tournament of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am fully grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy I could have recovered the cup.
It is a success of the entire team and I am very glad that I have been able to help," said an excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
It is now time for his compatriot John Rahm, who has already defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods for 2 and 1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, as I grew up seeing this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches in France and now he has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, remaining only behind Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team had to fight throughout the weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we lost him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will proceed.
I want these 12 boys a lot and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's up to us to bend our head.
They've overpowered us."
