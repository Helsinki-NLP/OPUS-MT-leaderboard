The social map of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of public passenger transport facilities.
As of 24 September, the arrangements for facilitating a citizen ' s journey are changing using a social map of the people of the Ivanov region.
According to the press service of the Government of Russia on the Ivanov area, the changes provide for the maintenance of public passenger transport allowance and provide a social map reconciliation scheme in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the FZ on the National Payment System.
The social map of the people of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application change.
Thus, the filling limit is now set, not in travel as before, but in cash, by keeping winter and summer periods of not more than 400 rubles during the summer period, not more than 800 rubles per month.
Now the owners of the social card on the receipts issued in transport will have to track, not the number of remaining travels, but the balance of the money.
The cost of a comfortable journey for citizens will be 1/2 the fare of the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the area budget.
The timetable for filling the social map with money remains the old one, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
A new social map tour will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep a detailed account of the spending of money on a social card with a copy accuracy.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning the assessed but unencumbered funds.
Let us also add that the timetable for the calculation with the carriers is becoming transparent, as half the cost of the journey is now being paid by the citizen and exactly the same amount is being repaid to the carrier.
There will be no commissions on the cash map.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Road Management and Transport of the Ivanov Region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million visits were made to the region using a social map, in 2015 almost 25 million visits were made.
In the area budget, more than 470 million rubles are provided for the benefit of citizens using a social card.
As at 1 September, more than 312 million rubles had been recovered for these purposes.
During the call to 911, a teacher admitted to murder a friend
During a call in 911, the teacher of Shannon Lamb’s sister - in - law told the police that he had shot his friend and that there was a need for staff to come home.
Lamb stressed that there was a "sand" in the house, which was alive, but probably upset, and said that contact with family members could be found on her phone.
In the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note that was carefully written on her hand on the white sheet of linen: "I'm very sorry, I want to go back, I love Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the representatives of the bodies signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who conducted two online courses at the University of Delta, Cleveland, Mississippi, managed to travel 300 miles to a university campus, where, according to the police, he shot all of Ethan Schmidt's respected professor of history at the doorstep of his office.
The Chief of Police of Delta University, Linn Baford, reported that the university staff learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call in 911 shortly after that.
By the end of the day of the victims, there will be one more: Lamb has finished with him as soon as the police surround him.
The next day, after the shooting at the school had forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities were still trying to put in one picture the motive behind Lamba.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to create a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students told me that they were looking forward to his training.
The police in Gothia, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal proceedings.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his written book, in which he expressed his appreciation for the “wonderful people” with which he crossed his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
A student who spoke well of Lambe, Brandon Bevers, reported that he also seemed alarmed and nervous as if something was wrong with him.
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of the year 2014-15 about how he had coped with stress.
Earlier, Lamb asked Delta State University to give him sick leave, said he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university rules of admission meant that the doctor ' s degree, over which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic appointment as a teacher.
The president of William Laforge University told him he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "evidently, Mr Lamb had something in mind."
These are questions Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked Lamb after he escaped the campus when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot 38 calibers in the backyard, one mile south of his parents ’ home in Greenville, Mississippi, reported the coroner of the Washington Bethel Johnson district.
His engine was still on the road.
Immediately it was not clear why Lamb had come to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb started working at a university of 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received the degree of a doctor of teaching science in the spring of that year.
A former friend of Lamb described him as a smart, charismatic, and cheerful man.
Carla Hayston told me she was 15 years old, and Lambo was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends had been studying in senior classes, and he was a classic senior guy who had been trying to teach her to play guitar for several years.
In those years, he enjoyed the success of women.
All the girls kept quiet when he was around," says Hayston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Brandon's suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss have been meeting for some time by the time of the events.
While calling 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Goth in a brick house whose side goes out to the canal.
According to the police, the dog's okay.
The ex-husband Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's quite overwhelmed," said O'Stin about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both played at a summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter wrote music and poems.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and co-ordinator of entertainment programmes in the dark lighting bar The Julep Room in Gothia, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of 5 September, when Lamb ended up playing the guitar and the losing tune for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious about it.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We've been having fun and we've been looking for each other.
I mean, they were both very sharp.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, held seminars for the first class and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married, and he had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas, Emporia, and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
On Tuesday evening, some 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, attended the commemoration ceremony at Delta State University in Cleveland.
The women of Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony at which the University Choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The occupations will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," Laforge said.
Crisis's over.
It's a healing day.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped to prepare the authors Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a statement by the police that the Call of Lamba had arrived at 911 after the murder of Schmidt, and that even though Lamba had spoken about Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information about their marriage had not been confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us announces that it will not hire as many staff for the holiday season as it did last year, while the Toys R Us radiator assures children that it will allow staff and temporary staff to work longer hours.
The company reported that it was planning to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and on opt-outs across the country, less than 45,000 of whom had been hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs would be part-time.
The company reported that interviews with applicants would begin this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although the shopping season is getting closer a few months before the holidays, companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have sufficient staff in stores and for the sale, unloading and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is kidding about the wake-up with Princess Diana.
The "Back to the Future" premiere proved to be a great event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in a movie theater waiting for members of the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and it set me up here -- next to me will be Princess Diana," he told in a trailer about a document film entitled "Back in Time."
The movie begins, and here I come to the head, that I am literally at the distance of the extended arm and in one false zest from meeting with Princess Welsky.
"Back in Time" - a documentary on "Back in the Future" - includes an interview with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemex and executive producer Steven Spillberg.
The "Back to the Future" premiere took place 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spillberg, "this is, without a doubt, the greatest movie about travels in the time that has ever been taken."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some movies in October.
UN chapter states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Pan Ki-moon said in response to Russia ' s military support to Syria that the almost five-year conflict “does not exist” and that the increase in arms would only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions.
The UN chapter again called upon all participants, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning a meeting with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the Council's disagreements, as well as between the Syrians and the local authorities, had made the situation unresolved.
Mr. Ki-moon called on five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had demonstrated in addressing the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is not kidding.
Some tried to hang the provocative tag on him.
Others have turned away from him by acting like a joke.
And some need scandals.
But no matter what some Republicans are trying to challenge the high status of Donald Trump in the polls, they have failed (to date).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in binary figures, and some began to ask seriously what it meant for the real estate magnet to get a nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has the chance to appoint the Republican Party.
The experts point out that in 2011 Rick Perry gained his winning popularity with German Cain, none of which won a state in the nomination process.
And there are a lot of reasons why he would be fighting in general elections.
But external groups, such as the Jeb Bush Political Activities Super Committee, and the Economic Conservative Group, the Growth Club, recognize the unweaking power of Trump and begin to deliver their dollars in order to discredit him.
Here are some of the survey figures that say the real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
Sympathy ratings for Trump were 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump announced his application in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive attitude toward this magnet in the area of real estate.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
In early August, that was 52 per cent.
Six of the 10 Republicans are now in favour of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators are getting tops in the early stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of the Republicans there had a positive impact on Trampu.
Two thirds of those voting for the GOP would establish Trump as a candidate.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they had either been "hermited" or "satisfied" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "depressed," if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say that they would treat "with lightning" against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next at the level of the storm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say that they will be "unsatisfied" or "depressed" if the Jeb Bush Foundation is a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider the Tampa temperament to be a problem.
While the Trompa media are critical of its greed and insults, 52 per cent of voters from all over the country think that the magnet has the right temperature to be president, as ABC News/Washington's poll on Monday showed.
The same figure is shown in the country ' s first closed assembly in the state of Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans believe that he has the same person as the main commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who can be effective at the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperament does not fit the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republican voters are used to that.
When they wear their hats, the Republican voters think that Trump is serious.
On the question of which was the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
It's not like four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters did not have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four out of 10 Republicans had chosen Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent had supported possible candidate Mitt Romni.
However, this shows that the majority of GOP voters consider the Trump campaign to be convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to split around another candidate, Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some scholars suggest that such a distribution is likely to benefit Trump, while not supporting Trump is equally distributed among more than ten other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical competition “one by one” between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always supported by the majority.
He's going to beat Carly Fiorino to 13 points, Marco Rubio to 14 points, Walker to 15 points, Jeb Bush to 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kesich and Chris Christy to 33 points.
He's got nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's going around him?
Ben Carson has targeted a businessman at 19 points in a hypothetical competition “one at a time”.
To hear more than half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday showed that only half of the voters supporting the Trump said they were confident in their voices.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with his roommate, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their mind will probably pick Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violent” in his opening campaign two months ago, immigration became the most relevant topic in the 2016 talks.
Some are concerned that the Trompa branch will prevent key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and interfere with rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post survey held Monday, six out of 10 Republicans said they were in agreement with Trump on immigration.
Therefore, until immigration attracts universal attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the Government is taking on new developments.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support for approximately half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their external status.
Six of the 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll on Monday said they wanted a political outsider rather than a man with experience in the Government.
And they're also offended at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 per cent being "unsatisfied", and 21 per cent being "in anger".
The Government will decide on the fate of the pension indexes in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodec said that the Government is now looking for options for implementation of the Pension Index Act in 2016 to a real level of inflation, according to the GG.
She noted that the decision should be reached by 8 October, until the draft budget was submitted to the Government for the following year.
In addition, the kamin is discussing the extension of the decision to freeze the Russian cumulative pension.
The hungerer noted that the amount of pension funds was 350 billion rubles.
The total pension index for the following year is approximately the same.
According to the vice-premier, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions to the unemployed.
The hungerer believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to the socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that he will be paid by society.
The media had previously reported that two options for balancing the budget were being considered in the cabin.
Why are they often upset and reddened?
A doctor named Tatian Leviasov answers:
Our eras are broad, protecting the eyeball from the many small particles that are sitting on them.
Forgetting the regular cleansing of the centuries, we often contribute to the development of bluff.
Output is simple:
Don't rub your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special wet napkin for centuries;
At least 1-2 times a day, clean the end of the century from those stored in them for a day of harmful substances.
Cleaning procedures are not too complete with warm compressions with healing grass openings (salphea, romaches) that ignite the dense secret of salty iron and then with the massage of the ends of the centuries, which should be carried out by circular movement of thumbs;
Do not use alcohol.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to the thickening of the secret of the whole iron.
Phenyan claims that the Korean nuclears have created an atomic warhead.
The authorities of North Korea reported that the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yonben nuclear complex, is operating “full-power”.
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraphing Agency of the country.
It is noted that at any time, the DRC is ready to respond to “the United States aggression and nuclear threat”, as well as that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “by quantity and quality”.
The latest test of nuclear weapons was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, plans for the resumption of the reactor have not been reported since.
Phenyan claims that he was able to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the CNDR has repeatedly conducted mid- and low-range tests, says Polit.ru.
Girinovski needed to remove the mention of the brothers ' peoples from the Russian gymnasium.
LDPR leader Vladimir Girinovski believes that a mention of the alliance of the Brotherhood should be removed from the national gymnasium.
He said that during the meeting of the House, the Russian News Service reported.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"Very long gymnastics, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand," said Girinovski.
The Member considers that all four quarters should be removed containing the following line:
In the summer of 2014, Girinovsky stated that the current gymnasium should be changed to "God, King of Food", and the Russian tricolor to replace the imperial flag, polyt.ru writes.
Assad called upon all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
President Bashar Assad of Syria called upon all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe is to cope with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of this problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
It's our opinion on this problem.
"This is the point of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue to engage in dialogue in order to achieve consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible until people are killed until the bloodshed continues and people feel completely secure.
"So we can reach a consensus, but we can't do anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
Remember, some 500 thousand migrants, including Syrian immigrants, arrived in the countries of the European Union this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the largest since World War II.
It is not excluded that among migrants arriving in Europe, there may be thousands of combatants of the extremist "Islamic State".
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The inhabitants of the German city had a holiday for refugees.
In the last month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently strengthened border control to keep them in touch.
According to the authorities, about 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call significant numbers.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
Correspondent B.B.J. Hill was in Darmstadt, the town where migrants were received very warm.
Jeremy Corbin debuted at the session of the Prime Minister
Following Mr. Corbin's election, his debut at the Prime Minister's session was expected with great impatience
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will be the first to address the Prime Minister's issues for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues that had been raised in the second half of the day; his statement would likely be closely monitored by the press and Members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He spoke with the call "less theatre and more facts" on a weekly demonstration talk.
He also stated that he could miss certain meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr. Corbin as leader; it will take place after their appointment of a dark cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader ' s decision to remain silent during the national gymnastics service on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, was criticized by a number of Conservative Members of Parliament and was the subject of several excellent articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the State gym drew attention
The press secretary, Mr. Corbina, said that he had “stand in respect of silence” and acknowledged “the heroism of the Royal Soviet Union in the Battle of Britain”.
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the Dark Cabinet, reported Newsnight to BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the laborists to sing the national gym "independent" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly ten of the shadow ministers refused to play with Mr. Corbin ' s team, calling for disagreements on economic, defence and international policies, while at least one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant said that the political differences were also "collapsed" in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbin's appointment to a position in the European Union and the Government's restriction of compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin said at the Trade Union Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of restrictions in general.
Several hours later, Mr. Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that there was “full clarity” in the party because it was opposed only to Government plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party that David Cameron will meet in the "Course Box" in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labourers, who had promised a different approach to politics, said that he had " attracted collective resources" to raise the ideas of Mr. Cameron and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the county of Eilington North said that the Prime Minister ' s issues were being over-confronted, and that he would also refrain from effluent responses and exchange of quantities, instead of promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing youth.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economics in the shadow cabinet, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak when possible, he said that he had addressed the Speaker of the House of Commons to John Barcow to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to leave the political style of the "Armaro" Balagan, often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but recognized that he had failed a few years later.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's views have become a key indicator of the leadership's ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other Members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reform.
"Photon in Yobourg" Homeless young people who have been studied in photographers
Johannesburg Business Center is a difficult place for homeless people.

Pound Sterling is growing as Britain's salary increases
The pound grew in the background of salary growth in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising with the offer to purchase SABMiller.
From May to June, British earnings, with the exception of bonuses, grew by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth has been highest since 2009 and has been met as a transfer to the earliest time of forecasts for possible increases in quotations.
The pound of sterling rose by more than 1 per cent against the dollar and amounted to $1,5505, and to 0.84 per cent against the euro by €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index grew to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general terms, SABMiller shares increased by 20 per cent, thanks to a bid from AB InBev ' s competitor.
The transaction would bring together two world largest beer companies, collecting brands such as Budwiesr, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares grew by 0.9 per cent in the background of encouraging news from the competing luxury Richemont product group.
The latest sales data for Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, again started to grow.
Glencore shares grew by 5 per cent after the mining giant stated that he was able to get $2.5 billion by placement of shares, as part of the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper and packaging group shares were the leader of the fall in the index - 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the rating of the group to “sell”.
JD Sports shares grew after the company supplier of sports clothing reported 83 per cent increase in tax revenues of up to £46.6 million over a half-year period.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can interfere with expansion
Executive Director JD Sports Peter Kaugill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “high purchasing capacity in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing capacity will exceed the cost of labour, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports expansion plans, he added, which could mean reducing the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi pressing in South Australia and Western Australia.
The leading supplier of low-cost food launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA Rituals in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming influence of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two optical stores and the first of 120 shops in South and West Australia in the beginning of the following year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and promote IGA branding through mainstream media and social media marketing and Adelaide Show activities.
The campaign is accompanied by IGA Ritellers and Suppliers, such as the manufacturer of frozen Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers tasting in IGA stores, and store owners who sell to permanent customers tickets to the South Australian Football League matches.
It is expected that Metcash will reveal more details of its protection strategy on 29 September -- the day when this wholesale supplier of food, alcoholic beverages and economic goods will conduct its annual investor strategy day.
Much has been done, since stores under the IGA brand in South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as regular routers, so the market is more favourable to IGA riders than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in the US and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will account for 5 per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after opening its first stores, taking sales from all existing games, but mainly from independent Reuters.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA cyclists can lose $36 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year with sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets respectively.
The loss of income and sales of food at the high level of permanent costs of Metcash could cost companies around 13 million dollars before payment of interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because Morgan Survey's recent study found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food sales are expected to fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, reducing its market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed at the business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash “may well disappear over a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The market share of the IGA decreased from 18 to 14 per cent in 2010 and Metcash's income from the food business, which was supplied by the company to approximately 1200 IGA retellers, fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 due to the operating dividend and due to the pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up spending more than $150 million a year on the basis of price comparisons in Coles and Woolworths for a thousand positions a week and helping IGA riders to re-establish trading venues, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider range of food products.
Director General Metcash Ien Morris says that price balancing and refurbishment of trading areas is gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will increase net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hill
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism of his conduct.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has suffered in a recent scandal around his friend Nik Kiryos and deserves more respect than criticism, says President Dennis Australia Steve Hill.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duet and often known as Special Ks, was not at the center of attention because of Kirios' post-happiness with Stan Wavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison said, "The Vavrinka had to put on Kirios's shoulders, and I had to put on this guy's legs."
C, the last time they saw the Kokkinakis cracking missiles after his sister-in-law saved Richar Guske from the possible defeat of the US Open, Hill was loyal to protecting Kokkinakis.
The youth is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be second after Bernard Tomich in a single-level semifinal in Kubka Davis against the United Kingdom.
"I'm very worried about one thing, that's what Tanasi got into the conflict," said Hilly.
He really broke the rocket when he had his foot on the US Open, but he wasn't the first game that broke the rocket when hope broke, and I know Tanasi well enough to make sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at challenging situations in the U.S., with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves trust.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he's been treated a little dishonest.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's a lot of work, he's a great team member, he's never had any problems with other players, he's being respected outside the court, he's getting intense training, he's a great guy, he's a very dedicated and developed young man, and I think he should be valued for dignity.
Hill also supported the decision to forgive Kirios for an important match starting on Friday, assuming the “common agreement” is the right outcome for all, but assuming that the Canberra boy will return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not on the quarrels around [Cyrios]," said Hilly.
And I think that Nick came into effect very quickly, that people like Federator and Murray are proving, he's growing up in the audience, he's made a number of serious mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the center for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
After announcing the emergency situation, Hungary, on Tuesday, crossed the border with Serbia on the southern border and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally in order to hold on to the influx of migrants.
There have been riots at the border, hundreds of migrants have been mined in the border area, and the Serbian authorities have reacted severely.
Having stopped for an indefinite time on the road between the two countries' checkpoints, people fleeing from armed violence at home broke up the tents and were based on that location.
However, dissatisfaction grew.
When they were surrounded by a police helicopter, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police for a special assignment.
Some of the protests refused food and water.
Serbia's Minister for Foreign Affairs has declared the "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when they are increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the solution to the problem, not a related damage.
Negotiations with Brussels and other countries need to be held in the near future," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The strikes at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the next day after the 28-nation bloc was unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to shoulder common responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that a further 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary, would be reached in the future (in the following month or by the end of the year).
The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, called for an emergency summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis surrounding the continent next week.
Hungary, however, does not expect immediate action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The announcement on Tuesday ' s emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to cover the roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Ciarto, said that his country was also planning to collect a collection from the sidelines of the border with Romania to cover the flows of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the collection on the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were involved in the urgent work of completing the collapse of the barrier between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main " narrow place" and the border crossing of the European Union for internally displaced persons, many of whom are victims of war in Syria and countries in the Middle East.
However, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most of the people who come to the country are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life, not refugees, victims of war who have the right to protection, and that view is strongly at odds with other EU countries, namely Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight now consider it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) roll-over from a branch built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, as well as include longer prison terms for those accused of trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government is declaring an emergency," said a representative of the government of Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
The formal parliament must still authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the reporters of the Associated Press, who are on the border, have been observing the presence of military personnel with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Derde Bacondi, the National Security Adviser to Orban, reported the arrest of 45 persons who tried to cross the border at the border and 15 others inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, were currently under police custody, and were charged with administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are fixing the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings on the border with Serbia, pushing for the blocking of one of the crossings of the railway wagon, covered by the wheel.
The riots broke out on the main passage across the border near the city of Ryoska, Hungary, as the Hungarians placed a service space for people inside a metal container, and crowds of people pushed each other to break in.
About 20 people were able to enter, and thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road from Serbia to Hungary and announced their refusal of food and water until they were missed in Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been reduced by two in a national survey
Former Secretary-General Hillary Clinton continues to hold the two-way advantage in the democratic race for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is after her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support among the primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent), and Sanders is the second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Byden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters' support.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the first elections, the majority of Democratic voters said that they were too early to say that they had decided with the candidate they would support.
The Clinton parties are more confident in their choice than in supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost some support for demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton has a great advantage among women and the poor, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points away from her.
The preference given to Clinton by voters-democrats up to 50 years of age has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among the senior voters.
Last month, Clinton attacked Sanders for a two-fold number of Liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Nearly half of the country's primary Democratic voters are saying that they would be enthusiastic to support Clinton if she were to become a candidate for this party.
The fourth would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps it's not surprising that the current Clinton supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm for her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support her.
While 48 per cent of the primary voters say they would be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton, fewer voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that she is now a woman president (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate for this position (10 per cent).
The Clinton side also speaks of an association that connects it with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called a consensus on issues and opportunities for election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential electoral participation, 57 per cent of the primary voters would like him to join the race, although the third believes he should not.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the candidates from the party, the primary democratic voters are in most cases called Baiden.
Among the more than half of Clinton's supporters, they say they'd choose Baiden the second, that's more than Sanders'.
If Byiden decides not to give his nomination from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Byden among the race participants to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of Democratic voters saw a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning in the general election; however, this figure had declined by 78 per cent last month.
According to this indicator, Baiden with a high standstill in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in response to the question that is most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than opportunities to be elected.
Similarly, in the past month, none of the candidates from the Democrats or potential candidates is acceptable to these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown a good result of some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Byyden of all three is leading in honesty, and the strong side of Clinton in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary Democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on it.
The primary democratic voters also generally consider the same ideological views as Clinton, Sanders and Baiden.
According to all these measures, about four Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions relating to the personal mailbox of the e-mail and the server at Hillary Clinton continue to be addressed by her Secretary-General, the majority of the primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this did not have a negative impact on their general view of her.
But it's a very different story for the American public in general.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public’s views on this matter were shared in March shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over e-mail had no effect on their general opinion about Clinton, although 36 per cent said that their opinion had deteriorated.
Most of these are Republicans, more than six out of 10 who claim to have had a bad opinion of Clinton.
Even though Clinton considered voters from her party to be fair and credible, it continued to be a problem for her among the registered voters in general: only 32 per cent considered her fair and credible, eight points below last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good grades of leadership.
Of the six protested candidates Byden, Carson and Bush show a better result in honesty.
Most people see a more honest person in Sanders than they do, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for sampling from 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
As a result of a national survey, Ben Carson has approached Donald Trampu.
Ben Carson approached Donald Tramp in a recent CBS/New York Times survey.
The two candidates picked up half of the voters in the new poll, leaving all the others in search of resistance under their feet.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trump, whose support rate has increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson flew from 6% to 23% for the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson benefited from support in all demographic groups by pushing Trump into a group of voters-Republicans with higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorina and Governor Ogyo Jon Kasich, withdrew with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support dropped from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi, and Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, take the third place with 6 per cent.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this recent survey is plus minus 6 per cent, which was conducted in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed Carson's growth in surveys, showing support for 19 per cent of Republicans, with 32 per cent support for Trump.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Trump was significantly outnumbered by Carson.
As Carson ' s support increased last week, Trump made several critical cases for the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning the faith of Trump.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the closure of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of the first student of the Baruch College
About two years after the death of a college student during the ceremony of the Pocono Brotherhood in Pennsylvania, the charge of murder was filed against five people.
"The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood from New York College, Baruch, brutally attacked Chan Michael Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and did not bring him to the hospital in time, which resulted in his death," they reported to the police.
Officials say that a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound backrest pushed several times while he was trying to reach his goals by walking down the surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the P. Delta Dogs didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they were waiting for an hour before he was taken to the hospital.
However, they have found time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask for advice, as told by the police chief Chris Wagner at the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially by putting the well-being of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
They couldn't save him, and he ended up the next morning.
According to the discovery report, Deng has received several stupid head, buttocks and thigh injuries.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of rituals devoted to the brotherhood, as at least one student dies every year, starting in 1970”, said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members should be responsible, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe's affidavits turned to the charge of murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against a new and criminal treaty.
"We want to involve not only individual participants, but, if there is an organization that has authorized all of this officially or informally, so do we," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch’s college banned the brotherhood, and the nationwide brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in interest rates, and the bull market will meet, the bond's profits will rise, and the economy will drop to a recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to be before the attack, and how long it's going to continue.
Especially for the economy, there is little to explain about time.
The recession occurred only 11 months after the first rate increase and for 86 months.
The strength of the Federal Reserve to raise rates often, although not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the U.S. Central Bank's administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when they start raising rates but on how much adaptation will take.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
At the end of the day, however, market participants may find that the whole of the land around the rise in rates is overestimated.
“The first increase in federal reserve rates with a global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal at the end of the money age,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economy specialist in Capital Economics, in his commentary on customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to a more normal but still low level will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Consider how some areas of the economy could react, depending on historical trends:
As has already seen in the market in the last month or around, the expectation of rising rates may lead to some instability.
In increasing the rate, however, the effects are usually not so dramatic.
"It is unlikely that stock revenues will slow down for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's rate increases.
If, in particular, the market for the last approximately 35 years is more rapidly changing - about 14 per cent - towards an increase in rates, it remains sufficiently stable for 250 days thereafter (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to a normal state of average income of 14.4 per cent for the last six cycles, according to Bob Doll, the chief sales strategy specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to become more pronounced immediately at the rate increase, and stock revenues are beginning to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but increased rates often contribute to it.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point for the entire period of existence of an increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, only twice the nominal annual GDP since 1950 was below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it was long, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such an unstable economic background may be risky and raises the question “will this time be a second”, Deutsche reported.
Market participants are preparing to increase the Federal Reserve System rates all year round, with their views at the meeting of the Federal Committee of the Open Market, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy and economists believe that FOMC could have approved an increase in rates at the meeting, future trade is only a 25 per cent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all the cycles of rising rates to this day have been in the supercycle of increasing financial pressure on GDP, covering peaks precipitating recession very soon after the start of recovery,” the report says.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle to date is the longest that the Federal Reserve System has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record is 35 months long, it is only 74 months long and is not yet over.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is expected to increase rates, and this scenario is in some ways similar to the one that is being implemented for shares.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds will be faster than on shares when the Federal system changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, income seems to change the vector immediately after the first rate increase/decreasing in the cycle.
At the end of the increase in interest rates, the bond's income falls immediately," Deutsche said.
Experts on Charles Schwab ' s strategy believe that increasing interest rates will lead to a close-up of long-term and short-term bonds by making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds are often better in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of a fluctuation of income," says a study by Katie Jones, a fixed income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market is built on a more rigid monetary policy perspective”, she wrote.
The interest rates on short-term loans rose, income curves were more flat, credit advances increased, volatility increased, all market characteristics were strengthened by the Federal system.
In general, companies that run their main business in the United States will win from rising interest rates and local production will become more attractive.
International debt companies will be in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt is more expensive in financial terms.
"History shows that "quality" actions demonstrate greater market efficiency within three months of the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachs in the customer report.
Companies with a stable financial situation passed companies with a unstable state as a result of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 on average at 5 percentage points.
High-income companies, as well as low-volatility shares, also showed better efficiency than low-quality shares, on average, at 4 (percentage) and 3 (percentage) respectively.
The debt will be a major issue.
Companies with a high rate of debt with a floating rate lose most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchanges, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Investors could also see profit through higher income, even though experts were depending on how fast this would take place.
BBC Radio 3 - Copy Classic FM - Member of Parliament from Conservatives Andrew Bingham
A member of the Parliament of Conservatives Andrew Bingham criticised the station for "reducing standards"
Proves that it is becoming less and less competitive than a commercial competitor
He's also focused on BBC Music Awards, saying the prize is just messy with Brits.
Damien Collins, a member of the Parliament, who has broken down on The Voice with the same criticism, has not been original
"BBC Radio 3 is becoming a Classic FM," said the leader of parliament, urging the radio company to prove that it does something that commercial companies don't do.
A member of the parliament from conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leadership that the public radio station seems to be "stupid" and that it is becoming increasingly different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 doesn't seem to like using the word "simplification," but it seems to be becoming a Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits.
So if you're trying to do something else, here's two examples that first came to my mind, in which you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the accusation that BBC Radio 3 was moving far ahead with its commercial rival in the case of live music and the education of the audience.
What I'm going to learn from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere.
And his loyalty to live performances and the creation of music will not really compare with anyone else.
"So it's really very important, I think the interest of Radio 3 in the search for new music and the promotion of new products," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Manager Alan Davey claimed that radio stations had to work a lot more to attract audiences than in the past because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who was attacked by five commercial competitors during the hearings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of the parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music show of talents that BBC has purchased from the Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of £22 million.
See why the programme is often discussed because of the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Feit and Boy George participate as judges, was done in a typical BBC style.
He added that he wanted the Corporation to “find a hit in his own home stable” the next time she started a fun project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent the new The Voice seasons from being ordered in future or from using the money of those who pay the licence fee to other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales growth has slowed most in August, and this could be the Black Friday.
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase in online sales by seven per cent
Last month, the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could have contributed to the cost reduction
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there have now been signs of online sales alignment, after the latest data showed only a semi-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping expenditures in August have shown minimal growth since they began to be fixed in 2000, with only a five per cent increase.
Experts say that there have now been signs of online sales alignment, after the latest data showed only a semi-percent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the rate of growth in previous years and come back to 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMG Sales Index.
He explained that online sales had increased three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people had the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on a couch.
But now it comes out of the plate, and you can see the decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the causes of the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying before the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, buyers, five times as high as the average, rushed to computers to make use of the benefits offered, thus interrupting a number of sellers ' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter this fight for profitable purchases, could have caused people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, more than 1 pound of sterlings per 5 are lost online.
In the case of goods such as televisions and stereos, more than one third of them are sold through the Internet.
At the same time, more than four people buy clothing and shoes online more readily than in fashion shops on central streets.
Muslims are protecting those killed in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and the Ben Laden family is subject to sanctions
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies on the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane was broken
Hundreds of Muslims have flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims killed as a result of breaking the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
The clothes mainly in the white, which were present at the funerals, filled the passage to pay tribute to the first of the dead who had gone on their last trip to the al-Moassem cemetery.
The burial process passed past a sacred place, where only a few days earlier the building crane broke through the top of the mosque and fell on its occupants.
The bodies were issued for burial, while the King of Saudis fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
A total of 29 persons killed in the killing of a crane in the main mosque carried on the streets
Among the dead were the father of the four children of Cassim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage to the palace when the crane broke up.
Mr. Akram was in the main mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hadh.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hague in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left a crane shot at an inactive crane.
The Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi Press State Agency states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of an offence.
The English editorial of the news agency did not mention this detail, but reported that the company's leaders had been banned from going abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the crane had fallen into the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had met to go to the Hague this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements on the violation of the crane and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inadequate coordination with the weather service.
Tens of the cranes surround the main mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
The Ben Laden family has been among the closest to the ruling family in Saudi Arabia for decades and has managed major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida Usama Ben Laden was the son of the changeer, from whom the family declined in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and only a few days before millions of people came into the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for each capable Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million royalties (about £174,000) to relatives of the deceased, and the same amount was irrevocably incurred.
The other victims will receive half that amount.
Chapter B&Q argues that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for small money
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly recruiting repair professionals
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Result - opening more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouses across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, City correspondent Daily Mail
They say the British are putting milk and malaria aside, and instead hire skilled Eastern Europeans to do housework.
If you're able to speak to a mole or a hunter to decorate the walls, you seem to be in a minority in our day.
Because, according to the B&Q company owner, the British are increasingly recruiting home-based professionals to perform the hard work.
Veronica Lori, the new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns the house-building services network, reported that this trend was fuelled by a substantial flow of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering minimum price services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specialized in goods for masters, while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in B&Q store staff, since eight out of ten shopping decisions were made by weak gender representatives.
Most of the staff are now male.
She said that the recent demographic trends characterized by an increase in the number of single women ' s households who were more involved in housing than they were in the past could not be seen.
Mrs. Lori said, "There are still men working in our stores.
Steps must be taken to achieve a balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of five women in the role of leading British companies, whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top managers team, reaching among directors equal in number of men and women.
Kingfisher is not the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director General and Financial.
Mrs. Lori said, "This was a conscious decision, diversification, an important issue for us.
It was not difficult to find suitable women in the board of directors.
After the group had incurred closing costs, Kingfisher had shown a decrease in income and sales over a half-year period.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time of decision on the interest rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The world is observing the meetings held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discuss the most important decision for two days, whether or not to raise the percentage rate for the first time in the last decade.
The survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe that it would still be suspended and maintained at the current level of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are looking at the fact that the main bank can move from zero to start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working effectively, the economy is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned markets that changes should be prepared, but everything said about their confidence that all chances of such a move would be met.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open!" -- hundreds of refugees are scanning at a checkpoint at Horgosh on the Hungarian-Serbian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has covered the border for displaced persons.
The asylum seekers are already beginning to miss out on other routes to the European Union.
One of them is located in a closed border with Serbia across Romania.
Another through Croatia and Slovenia is in Austria.
According to some data, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now being sent to the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
The leaders were ordered from the authorities to follow without interruption.
Serbian Minister for the Interior Nebojsa Stepanovic assures us that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its opportunities are limited:
Our work is to secure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to have a human attitude toward them.
But this is already a common European problem.
It is difficult to solve, no country in Europe alone will be able to do so, and a smaller country like Serbia will be able to do so.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is uninvited:
If someone is called a refugee, he must fill in the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, they won't let him in our country, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already set up a 175-tikilometer liner on the border with Serbia.
But the Orban is not going to stop; it is planning to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maemarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
For a number of years, Vangelis Maemarakis has been a member of the law-center governments, which, in the opinion of the left, have led the country to a financial crisis.
Now he, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy party, is challenging Cyprus.
A few days before the election, he met with journalist Evronius.
Evronius: Mr. Mamarakis, welcome to Evronius!
Vangelis Mamarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by joining the Syrian Coalition, but now, according to polls, "New Democracy" was compared to it by popularity.
What changed during that time?
Vangelis Mamarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cyprus was lying a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget profit and prospects for economic growth.
The country has once again a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Cyprus was after them.
In the last nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and Mr. Cyprus ' s false promises.
And now they can easily compare what they are promised with what actually happened.
Daily life has become worse than in January when the situation has improved, with the majority of Greek citizens concerned.
Euronews: But you are saying that if the elections are won, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIZ.
Vangelis Maemarakis: The thing is, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not a coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, the political forces and all the ruling parties have met together to implement the programme on which they have agreed, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only cooperation between political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you at least try to change it in part?
Vangelis Maemarakis: We have actually voted in favour of Greece's European movement, because we well represent the devastating consequences of leaving the EU.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Junker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost had there not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current measures were austere as a result of Mr. Cyprus ' s negotiating process.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government wants to bring order to the authorities during the first year, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of the recession can again be negotiated, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be a mistake to think that we could go back to the negotiations with our creditors in the first year of the new agreement, as they are awaiting the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we must continue to privatise, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to benefit from EU funding and the greater investment opportunities that we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Cyprus ministers had never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and badly informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and failed to reach an agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at a table with Mr. Junker, the Netherlands, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Maimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we have tried best to implement the 2012 agreement with the sharp corners.
We have made progress in reform.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in an emergency.
The market had fallen and potential buyers were not seen to be willing to pay the price established by the Greek Government.
At the time I was the Speaker of Parliament, I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then a governmental majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, which was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we managed to bring the country into a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early universal elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: The mass flow of refugees has been moving in Greece for the past few weeks.
What do you think of this situation and the reaction of the European countries that these people are seeking?
Vangelis Maemarakis: The refugee crisis is a bomb of delayed action that we have to deal with after victory in the elections.
The reason is that the Government of SIRIZA did not act in this situation as it did.
Such issues should be avoided because only emergency measures remain if you have a problem.
And we're in that situation right now.
Even the temporary Government, which had changed SIRIZ, had done more in just seven days than Mr. Cyprus had done in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim Government, which are a valuable aid to the President of the Republic, who is calling for the EU summit, will enable us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some of the extraordinary events that happened to them.
This is a deeply humanitarian issue, and we will stick to the position that European policies should take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronus: Mr. Mamarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vanessa Mamarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Družkovka Donecka, during the day, the police chief's investigation of the area along with the military counterintelligence found and detained a suspect, who was 34 years old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropertrovska), who shot himself out of the car before the night of the joint use of alcoholic beverages, and the conflict in the village of Upper Jasinovat, Donetchina.

A man who opened a gun at the University of Delta left an apology note
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning -- and before he shot and killed his colleague later that same day -- Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that he was sorry for the first murder and wished to “return everything” to the authorities on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Gothie, Mississippi, reported that the professor of geography and public science at the University of Delta called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he reported that he shot someone.
Lamb told the inspector that the police had to send people home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he said that there was a "sand" in the house, which "no one's going to rot," but probably upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the gun.
Upon arriving at the scene of the crime, the police found Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like to bring it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, and ended up with him on Monday evening when he was surrounded by police.
The head of William Laforge's University told him he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr Lamb obviously had something in mind."
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb suggested a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services reported on Tuesday that there was “no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
Prentiss was referred to as a "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who reported having been married to her for about seven years.
They were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss had a daughter of 19, and that she was "unsatisfied."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were best friends.
According to Lindsey Nouls, whom the newspaper San Gerald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the last to work from home on the Internet.
Nouls told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog called Lightning and that she had met Lamb for about three years.
Nouls said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family at some point on Monday to say, "He won't go to jail."
On the same night when the police hit him on the "1" show near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods, and shot himself there.
According to a summary on the university website, Lamb received a doctoral degree in teaching at the University of Delta in spring 2015.
Stars That Lose Their Success
The actor (left), in the photograph with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his multi-year life satellite Farru Fossett, who died of cancer.
The actor is reported to have also suffered from drug addiction and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All of this certainly played its part.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United went off for a few months because of a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the League of Champions match, in which Manchester United lost PSV in Andhoven.
While the defender is suffering in this regard, which will not be able to go out in the field for at least six months, Louis van Gall hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
Trauma took place during Hector Moreno's foolish hint at the 15th minute of the 20-year-old show crashing into the PSV criminal zone.
He was helped in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Hall said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then they'll operate.
This terrible young man came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, faced a great deal of trouble and started playing fantastically, and here it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the compartment.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and was not assigned a penalty.
Arbitrary Nikola Riccoli didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gall believes the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge for yourself when I say it's a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad bite with two legs.
In his Twitter show, he writes, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how I'm devastated, my path to recovery begins, I'll come back even stronger than I've been."
More on the subject: Manchester United is experiencing an accident with Luke Shaw in defeating the game with PSV
The English defender will be further encouraged to join the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, PSV coach, said, "This is a very serious trauma."
When any game comes out with such a trauma, it's all very upset.
It was never the intention of our players to hurt the opponent.
Moreno moved his leg to Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gala at the 2014 World Championship.
"He is now very difficult because he did not intend to hurt the enemy, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, you feel bad," said Kok.
I couldn't see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like he (Marino) touched it, but I didn't see the hint under Luke.
Speaking to SBS6 Moreno, he said, "I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to carry it.
I'm really hard, and I'm really sorry.
Andrés Guardado from PSV was also taken to the hospital after meeting Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorex?
Every parent adopts one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it will take a little time before you know it's almost over.
I can see if you're not David Cameron.
Responding to a question by a representative of the Canicula Children's Rest Organization about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorex, a story with an environmental cover written by Dr. Suez in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment published on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always contains some image or message that we miss."
And yet, in addition to the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to be reviewing the contents of the book, he is actually describing the subject of a unique film that was taken in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the fairly short original story.
"In the surrounding high walls of the city of Ummnuzville, where there was no green and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girls of his dream, fulfilling her desire - to see this tree," - we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Suez (the current name of Theodore Suez Gazel), who died in 1991.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of Lorex's film, published on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounding high walls of the city of Unimnuzville, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girls of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, generally recognized as an active parent, was so unfamiliar with the contents of a book not named after a boy that he learned how to destroy the environment by the greedy tree cutter and the "thirty-man" fighter Nachokins, despite Loraks' protests (the name of a book) - a ridiculous substance with lips that "talks on behalf of trees".
Most likely, such an uncomplicated PR task was commissioned by an executive who had never read a book about Loraksa 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly obtained from the Cameron office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron headquarters, but no further comments had been received.
For Adam Lita there was a clear risk of not getting into England, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a challenge, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the repetition of the 3-0 series of tests, which happened last time, seems unlikely to me.
I wouldn't have excluded the victory from my field either.
The team of Alistair Cook may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it has games that virtually take the ball, and collective thinking is strong; they will bring no scars from 2012 but only a youth's position.
Moen Ali's ball turns into a baller that delivers the ball, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for the test level, is an offensive option.
More on the subject: Adam Litt was expelled from England by test cricket and replaced by Alex Hails
The decision to exclude Adam Litt from his chief coach in Yorkshire is, of course, difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality was that the players in the cricket were judged by judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said this before) the players choose themselves best.
A couple were half-hearted, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own fate.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The Chief Coach of the Assembly of England, Trevor Baileys, spoke well of his mood, even when he didn't show up what he was capable of, and it doesn't surprise me; he's first the team game and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the betsman of the test cricket is impressed is a difficult question.
Lit played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton played nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on a foreign field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean League when Lit was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity in the past.
Alex Hayles shows up, and he's a Batman I appreciate.
He's an unpredictable cricketer that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he won 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge Square, which was already something.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but of course it will depend on the membership of the OAU team.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening Batman, which would allow the introduction of an additional backbone, keeping four speed boulevards, is being considered, and I am not against it at all.
I can't see the reason why the running game can't hit the ball, and this left one has already shown himself to be a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what he needs for his county of Woostershire, but he became the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old partner on Justin Langer's team played his first 38 "Batsman-Third" test match before leaving as an opener in 2001.
He won three hundred immediately and didn't look.
Zafar Ansari comes to the meeting as a backup spinster, and with my unpermanent society he has proved to me a very promising young man.
People can look at its typical statistics -- on average, 31 with beats and 35 with balls -- and think that it's a risky rate, but among the voters who voted for a little, and the voters chose youth.
He'll learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a few practical additions to the training course.
The appointment of Mahela Jayowordin, a Sri Lankan Batman, as a test match consultant could be a master's move.
He's one of the best guys for the game that will bring her the wealthiest experience ever gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used and will provide both energy and safe speed in the set.
I always felt that he was born to be active in the international cricket, whether playing or coaching, and like Mahela, he has little intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the separation, even if they say what was said before, can give new forces to the team.
Colleagues of the Darema Ben Stokes team have been left alone for one day, Ruth has been given a similar break with Australia, and for example, I am not experiencing any problems in this regard.
Although not all of them agree, players and trainers do not determine the timetable.
And you have to remember how the players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The British outlaws' camp from the Euro Union can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's unthinking policy of resumption of Britain's EU negotiations is increasingly difficult every day, even without regard to the choice of the brilliant Jeremy-"Is that yes or no?"- Corbina as the leader of the Labour Force or the failure of the TUC about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
The Social European Diplomat explained that, in the present situation in the EU, which is experiencing various crises - not all of which are of its own making - some countries are participating in the British self-centered agenda for concessions and undermining arrangements for changes which they do not want to most of the time.
After meeting in Briton for the annual meeting, TUC decided that he would not want them at all if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "the selfie program Dave and George."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance travels through the summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves in the background of a well-known local monument, in or without a local celebrity company, and then come home and say that they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who is interested in maintaining external contacts with Britain under the European Union - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that ambitious ministers and officials in some capitals come to understand when they will still be, we will stay or go.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German Chancellor, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before the situation worsens, as it has worsened for those who sit in her seat Tetcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kola (16).
The head of France, France, is faced with a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing his power too.
Poland may soon receive the nationalist Government of the right-wing movement, Spain - the left.
It's hard to see them walking out of their skin to help the self-British people whose energy could be wasted to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, which they don't want either, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can even plan to issue intentionally useless SNP-style rematch during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to push Britain out of the EU, my friend suggests.
"The revision was the idea-fix" and "British has not received any value from the renegotiation negotiations."
Europeans know what a thief can be on the Fly Street and how skeptical the media are about the EU, unlike the time of Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
They may be sad to recall Boris Johnson, a native Euro opportunist, who celebrated his "direct bananas in the EU" by a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his folly, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a pistachio company with fearsome julian taxes, phone hackers and non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair was quite the same about them, but he realized that when you're in a big gorilla, you have to give her bananas to pull her off and not let her eat you on a lunch and tea again.
Milliband was, in fact, more committed to Blair than Blair himself, in opposition to Cameron's idea of the referendum, because Blair had adopted the principles of the EU's repealed constitution, buried by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, who issued him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who friendly grabbed me back in Westminster on Monday -- I told him that he had no time to spend on me -- seems to be at risk of repeating the strategy of Neil Kinnok's "boycott Merdoku" from the 1980s -- a mistake both then and now.
This may take time, but he must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press -- not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marro, on whom he sat on the couch in the VVS on Sunday.
The official position of Corbin in Europe is what I call evolution delicately.
He says he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, the majority of people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and a wider circle of “small- England sidewalkers” among the bull may say yes.
It's the same as Hillary-Bennan, but not Bennit-Bennit-Bennit said on the radio and TV this week, and his internal combat squad from all over the world refused to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell as the "tender" finance minister by Corbin was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s when his old man from all over the world was on TV for being disloyal to colleagues at the Labour Office, not going too far and not losing his position in the Cabinet of Ministers.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "under any circumstances" -- Benna's phrase -- is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. said to the Peruvians and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, according to the public opinion.
Whatever democracy and his "boy" Corbin - remember, he even crowned me - the message discipline remains important for the centuries of round-the-clock television seven days a week, and especially in the water supply of social networks, the outbreak of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to make Cameron so easy to separate from Europe as to allow him to accept as an appropriate support from the Labourers during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corbin's main confusion about EU membership - within the "Bennit" economy of the occupied strength - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among leftist dissidents, for whom narcissism, born of minor distinction, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his mistakes regarding NATO-Tom Watson, it is unmistakable that J.K. will not hesitate to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin lose political capital -- they also have suspects -- on Britain's bids, when all this could be pointless?
The United States is already very disappointed by the weak military action of British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of Turkey will cut costs, as I was reminded on Monday at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticise the review of electronic cigarettes by Public Health England
Statements by the Government-funded agency that electronic cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking, made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were related to the tobacco industry, according to researchers.
Experts who published the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet have criticised the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report, “reversible” last month, calling it “a comprehensive review of evidence”.
However, some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed out that some experts were involved in the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in the medical journal Lancet, last month, “an extraordinary boxing argument” was criticised by PHE as its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers were asked whether these statements contained “solid or sinister grounds”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: “The fundamental principle of health is that rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
According to them, the public expects that PHE’s statements that “the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco” were based on detailed analysis of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is reflected in the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criteria model of decision-making to summarise their views on the damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are briefly presented in scientific publications.
Macki and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT health certificates in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, without mentioning the funding he reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of members of the board, but there were several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also reported financing of the industry in publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco industry in PHE.
The scientific article, published by the group, “is entirely in agreement” that there is a lack of “significant evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria”, wrote McCi and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PhE ' s statements that “there is no evidence at present that electronic cigarettes are a road leading to children or non-smokers” were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's statements had already been responded to.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two who smoked his whole life died of his passion.
All the evidence implies that the risks to the health of electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what they are proving and what they do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative risk to tobacco.
Some 80,000 people die of smoking-related diseases a year, and NHS costs 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause some of the damage to smoking - we are doing our job before the nation.
Former Head Channel 4 believes BBC should stop the EastEnders series
Former Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop publishing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give up much for such a successful show as a charity opera on the Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not issued by other British radio companies.
He criticised BBC for putting public broadcasts, which probably only look at a small part of the audience, for the peak eerie time when competitors go to a high-rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After the director-general of BBC Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that for six years he had failed to cooperate with BBC while working on Channel 4.
“I can’t help but think that BBC is preparing for launch and transmitting transfers that could show non-subsidy competing companies,” Johnson told the members of the Committee on Communications of the House of Lords as part of a follow-up to BBC fate.
If you keep the licensing assembly, which I do not consider to be a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should leave only programmes that are not issued and are not to be issued by other companies.
The Voice Show comes out of the air in the premium slot because the creators want to get as much support for the future as possible.
The idea of no one showing him again is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to finance transfers that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one example, East Enders is another; it is known that they are their own production.
Other channels would no doubt give a lot to her.
I don't understand how this could be a public news.
I don't think that would somehow bring down the BBC.
Serial Entrepreneur Johnson, head of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings “on the basis of staff ambitions and their belief that this is the best way to obtain long-term support”.
His comments on the most popular show on BBC are addressed to the comments of Executive Director Sky Tony Ball, who in his memoir MacTaghart in Edinburgh in 2003 invited BBC to sell East Enders series.
Johnson noted that more extensive public BBC transfers “are continuing to go to BBC4, where there is often no evaluation of the audience, but therefore the role of the company has been performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the Hong Kong sermons justifying the income from licensing fees at 4 billion pounds: “Well, of course, we are doing all of these unimaginable transfers that nobody sees.”
They put them in locks where no one will ever see them.
With regard to the licensing assembly, Johnson informed the Committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system as to who will receive the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people who have 150 pounds a lot of money, I'm curious, because they don't really watch and listen to BBC.
The former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission for information, education and entertainment.
He noted that only a small proportion of BBC publications are now formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1 per cent of television content and 0.1 per cent on the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the heading “Information, Education and Entertainment”.
On the issue of partnership, Elstein noted that BBC should make more efforts in such areas as the “Provisional Concerts” (only part of them, he said, appear on TV) and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
"Sonogetics" allows you to control your brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how no one changes the direction of movement when they are affected by sound impulses.
Scientists have extracted worms from a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction of movement when they are affected by sound impulses too high to be heard by the human ear.
Impulses are influenced by the activation of genetically modified neurons to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
More on the subject: Researchers manage the brain with light
Scientists have said that worms demonstrate the possibility of a new method called “sonogenetics”, the essence of which is to use ultrasound to initiate certain cells of the brain, heart and muscle, while the ultrasound source is out of the body.
Schrikant Chalasani, a scientist at the Institute of Solka, La Hoyoya, California, told the Guardian that this method could once replace the deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used to treat Parkinson's disease.
The worms don't usually react to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles were intensifying the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
Strong ultrasonic waves affect structures called "TRP-4" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and trigger cells associated with them, reported in the Nature Communications report.
To create nowhere to be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to worms, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worm organisms by activating modified motor neurons.
This methodology is similar to that used in the “optogenetics” - a new direction that allows scientists to include and disable neurons with light impulses.
Chalasani claims that, compared to this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the right part of the brain by the backbone, low-frequency ultrasound waves are easily passed through the body’s tissues, so their delivery does not need to be carried inside the skull.
“We believe that in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will in time make human neurons sensitive to ultrasonic signal,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method could also be applied to muscle and insulin producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment is on your doorstep!
Advertisements issued against British arms trade
Consider the role of Amnesty International in protesting the arms display.
Striking drones!
Ruins of iron claws!
Falling bombs!
Electrical light and noise dunes that cause unbearable pain but do not leave any traces!
The sound voice and cartoons have no doubt that this advertising of the largest international arms exhibition is the only parade prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to “press” weapons against repressive regimes using the exhibition of defence technologies and security systems at the ExCeL Centre in Doklands.

But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains that need to be looked at again.
"An important announcement on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by the London Metro fonts with a DLR line that turns into a tank silhouette.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will feed on DLR. Passengers are asking for help to prevent the display of weapons.
300 posters were drawn by artists who exhibited their works at the "Museum of Cruel Design" in the Bank of Desmaland Park.
By collecting them under the name of the Special Patrol Group, they have helped to spread them across London, using the 6-pound set of gate keys, which is said to “give access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet”.
Transporters in London are not happy with this “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the paradoxic announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of Cruel Designs and professor at Essex University, artists are becoming more demanding and sought to bring political art to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with protest movement activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world because of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the display of weapons welcoming passengers in the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook 24 hours ago and was created by a VCCP working pro bono, with a graphic designer and sound artist also working free of charge.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever was struck by the ad silence around the arms show, with the passage in the ExCel calendar, and thought, "Let them set up a campaign they're trying to avoid".
They were thinking of creating more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but “filling her house with bright colors and animation became more exciting”.
"They have helped us to attract attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take action and to guarantee that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold directly at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of arms exhibition goes from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically effemized products.
In the Saab press release, information was released on the command of "AT4CS RS for shoulder-shooting" from the U.S. Army.
It includes “a non-amalgamous cumulative missile weaponry, which has an unsurpassed internal barrier action”.
No matter what he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules of living in student communities
It has been 11 years since I moved to a student community as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in bartage and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the strained smiles of those I've been exasperating -- and the many, long complaints to others.
Basically, what I learned can be explained by eight simple rules.
Moving to a community can vary from mild to very scary to nervous.
He encourages me to talk: tell people where you came from, if you took an academic leave and where you took it, if you support Corbina and why you "I don't love or hate "Marmite," because seriously, guys, it's just a hahaha rice extract, I'll be there."
Breathe.
And help others to move, too, ask questions and show interest.
This supports conversation and helps you to find people you like, not those you wouldn't even talk to, even if the fires were on fire for you.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often turned into drinking establishments, semi-detached cinemas and common tunics, but they are also the place where people dress and fix their underwear.
Also on the subject: Don't even think about starting college with relationships
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room must be a haven, but many communities form a culture of Satan from one room to another, which fosters friendship, society and leads to long friendships.
This could be a hell of a man who's trying to restore power.
There's nothing in the culture that allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep dating you, but I need you to leave, and I've been able to restore the energy I've spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel when the contestant is tired of the public, and not hit him, but text him.
By the way, knock: do it.
One boy in my community followed the principle: If the door was not closed, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
I've been working with my friends for a while.
Since you're starting a university life at the peak of the Bake-Off show, you're going to knock on the door to introduce yourself and teach you a piece of chocolate pie, it's no longer that strange action, it's not like in the 1950s with their "Welcome, we neighbors, I've got something for you, and now smile, and I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Offering a home pet is a great way to get married.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, that depends on how good a baker you are.
Poorly blinded stomachs of pain, sugar and fat will soon make people sleep when you hit them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student communities.
Of course, assigning someone to a chicken is a theft, but is it a theft to take a sense of milk for tea?
Talk to the milk owner.
He'll probably suggest that you stay out of it, even if it's anger inside.
If someone cheats on your stuff, it upsets you, and I feel for you, but try to treat this adult more than my neighbor who poured a liquid into his milk to wash the dishes to avenge those who took it without asking.
She's in prison now.
You should not make a noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the proverb about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to increase the sound of drums and bass guitars, as she had 3 o'clock in the morning, and she had her exams in the morning.
In response, there was an increase in noise.
When he finally shut up at 5: 00 a.m., she kindly allowed him to sleep for two hours and then knocked on her music and locked the door by going to a three - hour exam.
Isn't it romantic for your future husband to live in the same neighborhood as you do?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extraordinary, before you bite the elbows, certainly, if you took your neighbor for your future wife, got involved with them, broke relationships, and had to see him every day, and maybe watch him pull on his side all your common friends?
Of course, you don't have a heart attack, but if a hot neighbor isn't exactly your future husband, try to cool your own dust.
At the very moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the edge between the rag and the grass is thinner than it seems.
Good play is fun, but it turns out to be the opposite of a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never touch a room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the other door and drop the keys in the glass with the water, which you then put in the freezer--but don't glue the other thing with Blu-Tack to the top twice.
iOS 9: how to set up a new operating system on the iPhone after the Apple update
A new operating system can be asked to choose General by entering Settings and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to jump and fix it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when a bug report has appeared telling them that the update of the annex has failed.
To avoid this, users are encouraged either to wait until the recovery is stopped or to try to update through iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may include the removal of applications for increased space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the amount of update, and has also made it easier to implement with the help of a special utility, which proposes to remove and re-install the applications after the process has been completed.
You should be sure that your phone is plugged in or next to the charging device when you update it, so that you do not allow battery power.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating, as the dialing of the phone in the process may lead to updates.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, Moscow ' s military support to President Assad led only to a deepening of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“The Secretary Kerry has made it clear that the continued support of President Assad by Russia poses a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism – if we do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power,” said the representatives of the U.S.
They also noted that Kerry had repeatedly stressed the United States' commitment to combating the Islamic State in the framework of a coalition from more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in trying to resist the Islamic State”.
Last Friday, representatives of the White House said they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet arrived: "When the President decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will raise the pipe and try to make the call."
Barack Obama himself believes that Russia's decision to increase its support for Assad's "permissive rate".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that Assad's continued support would only make the situation worse.
"But he did not heed my warnings - and the situation worsened," said the President of the United States.
The imported yachts will be exempt from payment of customs duties.
Mini-economy is intended to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for rest and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of preferential goods for temporary import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the RF.
The "Reports" was reported by Elena Laškin, assistant Minister of Economic Development.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of departments - Mineconomrovia, Mintransa RF, Minkultura, MID, MCS, FSB, FTS, Rosturisma - to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for yachting in coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - approximately €200 million a year are serving the punishment of European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission for Europe on the modification of the List of Goods to be imported temporarily with full conditional exemption from customs duties, which provides for full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for rest and sport.
In the view of the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to creating favourable conditions for the development of yachting in coastal areas of the country, Laškin noted.
The question was raised by the Customs and Customs Sub-Commission on Customs and Non-tariff Regulation, the protection measures in external trade of the Government's Economic Development and Integration Commission, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies as a result of the discussion.
As the representative of Mineconomy pointed out, the proposed measure for full conditional release on importation was, in fact, a benefit.
Therefore, after the adoption of the protocol of the meeting of the Sub-Commission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Mineconomie will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with EEA member States, Laškina explained.
The list of importable goods which are fully exempt from customs duties, taxes include the goods necessary for the promotion of external economic activities and international cooperation, for the application of science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, for international assistance and so on. Among them are operating equipment (personal computers, typewriters), measuring equipment, bulling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, moving laboratories and masters, water slides, trolley cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious ceremonies.
In the press service Mintransa RF “Reports” reported that mandatory regulations on the ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupathia had been drawn up, which provided for a simplified procedure for the formation and exit of small, sporty, port and recreational vessels at sea.
Mintrans has been commissioned to ensure that small-scale, sport-pare and recreational vessels are deployed in the seaport and that the vessels listed are taken out of the seaport.
Mintransa has also prepared draft regulations by the Government of the RF on the approval of the limits of the waters of the Seaports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the regulations have already been adopted, the others are in the process of agreement, noted in the department's press service.
In the view of Mintrans, host supervisors, classification and inspection, registration of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia, yachting was extremely difficult because of poor infrastructure.
If you look at southern Italy and France, there is an entire constantly developing industry that has a large number of people involved.
In fact, everything is in place in Russia.
Our coast is a small, one piece where you can use your yachts for a year, is the Black Sea in the Sochi, Gelengica, Novorossiska, Anapa.
But it is a great challenge that the border service rules are extremely strict in this area: a mass of permits needs to be formed in order for you to walk out.
Besides, inside Russia, you're even going to go somewhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where to take it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage sites, there are now special anchors for yachts up to 30 metres in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The yachts are also being shipped to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich people, but at the beginning of the crisis the demand for yachts had declined.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the international organization ' s press service.
“The new funding will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the report said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Cimyao Fanh, said that banking sector reforms would help to rebuild loans in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank had seen the first signs of stabilization.
However, due to the serious problems of Fan, the Government of Ukraine is calling for speeding up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish Government approved the grant of a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, according to RIA News.
Prisons are asked to establish separate blocks for transgenders.
The Public Council of the Federal Enforcement Service (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015 will discuss the possibility of establishing separate blocks for transgender and transvestites in colonies.
The "Reports" were told by a member of the Council of Vladislav Grib.
He believed that, depending on the total number of prisoners in Russia who had not been identified with sex, it was possible in domestic prisons to provide for separate chambers, blocks or even (if such criminals were many) to establish a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is possible to determine the execution of the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicted persons have received appropriate medical examinations to prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Governor Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of the executions.
He said that the proposed practice worked successfully abroad: the SISO (where the accused were tried before the court) had separate cameras for transgenders, and the correctional facilities had special blocks.
Today is the only way to deal with such criminals.
They need to be isolated, because the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary cameras is dangerous to them, it is suffering for their families and for the sea of problems for the staff of the FSIN.
The lowering of the transmissions by the cameras is guaranteed," says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the large city, the number of criminals with an indefinite sex needs to be calculated where to distribute them.
SIZO is definitely not needed - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgender.
As Gryb explained, 50 or 100 persons could be included in the block, and if a specialized corps was established in Russia alone, trans-sexual prisoners could be punished from any region.
Citizens are held in SISO at the scene of the crime, so the proceeds of transvestites or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, and this is the practice for those already convicted in a separate colony, yes, considers the Gryb.
Remember, before the law enforcement officers were able to decide which male or female investigator-insulator to identify the 24-year-old transsexual Dmitria Kozukova (known as Alina Davis), who had not been arrested with a virgin.
He was released at home under the ban.
This was widely discussed in the social networks and the media, as there was no transgender mechanism in the CISO and in the Russian colonies.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT movement activist (LGBT-Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) Nikolai Alexiev supported the idea of creating special places to punish transgenders, noting that it is also possible to identify men or women in the colony abroad, depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, as is the question of security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexiev.
Prisons must be safe, so certain blocks could be made on behalf of homosexuals, more than transgenders.
However, Alexiev doubts that many citizens in Russia will be willing to resign themselves as transgenders in order to be distinguished from the ordinary colony.
Of course, medical examinations can be introduced before putting people in a transgender colony, but not always.
For example, in the U.S., a prisoner named Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison he said he wanted to change sex," Alexiev said.
A person can feel anything.
But as long as there are no separate places to punish transgenders, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such people and be able to escape their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of RF Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of trans-sexual offenders in the colony could greatly delay the start of the execution of sentences.
The commission is creating a sexuality issue, psychiatrists are carrying out long-term surveillance, not one test based on a high-level opinion.
Psychiatry can do this today.
Therefore, even before gender change, potential patients always undergo such experiments - they show exactly whether gender change with surgical intervention is the necessary measure," says Lord Kipanida.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how the system could be implemented with respect to convicted persons, because on average, the survey is monthly.
The doctor, although he generally supported the creation of separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubted that under current economic conditions it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
It is difficult to take into account that there is no official statistics, but if it is to take into account that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that transgenders are even smaller and those who have such a denial and still commit a very small number of crimes, said Lord Kipanid.
At the request of the administration of the Homosexual colony, transgenders are now able to obtain certain conditions of content.
Michael Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Hunty Mansiska, the world chess championship was completed among the young under 20 years of age.
The completion of the premier was more intriguing.
The winner was only on the last tour, and they became Russian Michael Antipov, who was still trying to push the Pole Jan-Kshitof Dudu, who would certainly go to the title.
The girls were awarded the victory by Ukrainian chessman Natalie Bux.
The peace chess championship, which had been held since September in Hunti Mansisky, had been almost completely lost in the middle of the tournament since the representative of Poland, Jan-Kschichof Douda, who had won the series of four victories (successful competitions on the Swiss system of 13 tours), was sure to take the lead.
Given the fact that Duda was one of the most promising young chess men in the world, the likelihood that he would miss out on the gained breakthrough seemed very insignificant.
And even when Douda let go of the traffic and allowed Russian Michael Antipo to reduce the drop to 0.5 balls, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for title.
In order to reach the leader, Antipo had to win the 13th tour.
But even that wouldn't help, win Douda's party.
In addition, this obligation of victory could, of course, affect the games of the Russian chessman and lead to non-compulsory mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov was able to avoid them.
He must have dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Douda to finish his party meeting Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately, for Antipo's sake, the Polish chessman faced a battle with the Dutchman in the morning.
Antipo and Douda have thus obtained an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipo's had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Hunty-Mansi Autonomous District, whose governor, Natalie Komarov, traditionally gave great attention to the development of chess in the region, gave him the main prize.
And there's not an intrigue ending in the girls' competition.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - had enough not to lose in the last round to win the title, which she had successfully done.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to reach Bux.
The Russian sportsman remained the second with the departure from the championship in 0.5 balls.
The dump is changing the regional structure.
The company brings together the Privolg and Ural regions in one unified Volgsk and Ural region, Siberia and the Far East, in the region of the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As the Director General of Vipelkom Mikhail Slobodin noted, the changes are being made to “remain a strong player in the market”, to develop the company “in new, not always favorable external conditions”.
In an interview with the 24th Russian television channel, Mr. Slobodin stated that he intended to reduce the ten per cent staff in Russia.
Rosusenasur checked 78 Moscow's Burger King breakfasts and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the Volkolam Shosse restaurants were fined for 50,000 rubles, while the Grand Tull Street facility was closed for 90 days, but resumed after all violations had been eliminated.
43 breakfasters violated the requirements of the room device.
Among other violations, inadequate sanitary and sanitary facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, have been found in some establishments in the rainflake group.
The franchise on the brand Burger King belongs to the OOO Burger Russ, the owner of the chocolate chain, Alexander Kolobov, who works 293 breakfasts in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, head of FAS, said that the agency against the 10 per cent indexation of tariffs for the carriage of goods and the granting of subsidies, as requested by the OAS RJD.
At first, they wanted 17 per cent of the index, now they want 10 per cent, and even billions of budget subsidies, he said.
We say, it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive personnel, football teams, your own TV, stop wasting money on the left and on the right.
He added that FAS had its own, much more stringent proposals, which were now being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a full $300 million share option, the gold-making company reported.

Sumer has until 3 October time to realize the option or to demand payment.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal do not reveal.
The option was made within the framework of the purchase of Polymetal Project Kisil in Kazakhstan.

Minpromorg: Addressing food aid will not be similar to cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Viktor Euttuvov, said that the food aid programme would not be similar to the card distribution system existing in the USSR.
This is about modern food aid to the population and the support of an effective domestic freight producer.
Please don't speculate on the word "food card."
It should be noted, in particular, that the proposed product maps should not be undermined by the cancellation of the total deficit time, the distribution card system, where the number of products received is normalized.
We have proposed a concept so far, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," says Mr. Euttuhova's TASS.
Previously, U wrote that the food card programme for the poor had been introduced into the Government.

This year's study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is scheduled for the 16th time.
As an instrument for assessing the professional reputation of Russian senior management, the study has led to the annual work of Russian managers, identifying industry leaders and functionalities.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of the Laureats of last year's rating.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year ' s rating and to appoint members of their management team.
In addition, each of the initial candidates is invited to appoint up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be useful to add to the overall pool of candidates.
The following executive heads of the company may be appointed: the financial director, the commercial director, the marketing director, the staff director, the IT director, the director of public and corporate relations, the director of relations with the authorities, the director of corporate governance.
Each of the proposed experts is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to appoint its management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of industry candidates is based on the industry classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forestry industries, machinery, media business, metallurgical, multi-profile holding, professional services, communications and telecommunications, consumer goods services and production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password for accessing the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can submit their evaluations on the proposed criteria for each functional direction.
The rating methodology is based on the "Better Choices" principle: Top Managers are rated top managers, and Functional Managers are rated by Functional Managers.
This principle enables the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
The meetings of the expert commissions are open to all candidates wishing for the current year ' s rating and multiple candidates for the previous year ' s rating.
The Commission shall be organized on a functional basis: the High Leaders' List Approval Commission and the Eight Chiefs' Approval Commissions.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (places remain strictly under the internet assessment and are closed information prior to the publication of the rating) or to update them according to the list of alternate candidates attached.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the Russian rules and the rules "U".
At the time of publication of the rating, there may be changes in the status of managers and companies.
Comfortable rate for the investment is 10-13%.
Experts estimate that the lending market for small and medium-sized enterprises in January-April of the current year has increased by 40 per cent.
What do you think the situation is today?
Following the panic of the end of 2014 - beginning of 2015, ICB's lending has decreased significantly.
The reason is the sharp increase in interest rates.
Credits below 25-30 per cent of the year have not benefited anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to raise all its possible problems further, from the deadlines to the non-refunds, it could not now be done: the rates and so cloudy.
For the business, the current level of ISB credit rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their occupability.
The 10-13 per cent rate would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive income.
How much do you think the demand for loans for entrepreneurs is met?
After the decrease in the percentage rate of CB, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have turned to loans much less.
First of all, business does not understand its development prospects and future revenues.
Today, one way out is to learn how to work, focusing on today ' s economic situation in the country and region.
More attention needs to be paid to monitoring current results, monitoring the flow of money.
At the same time, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately makes it possible for companies to make their products more competitive and to maintain their business even in an unstable economic situation.
What key trends in the ICB credit market will be strengthened and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for a reduction in the average rate will depend on the Central Bank's policy, and the regulator is now demonstrating consistency in the issue of a reduction in the key rate.
However, the radical decline in the credit price for ICB is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, inflation is, first of all, a necessary higher rate of interest for real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the CB rates are reduced.
With regard to the level of delays, the traditional small and medium-sized companies, which are limited both in cash-fill options and in economic behaviour adjustment options, would certainly be a higher risk for creditors.
I would not have expected a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese characters.
Beautiful, laconic and at the same time quite complicated for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
As well as the new CX-5 cruiser, as well as any other brand model: without skill, it is attractive outside, technically made inside.
The Japanese are already able, simply because of its "Japanese " , to bring the products of the rising sun to a state of full exposure.
It may be as easy as arguments for cars from other countries, and people will even agree to these arguments, but the whole conversation is starting to fade from the final phrase, "But this is a Japanese car!
Don't argue about anything!
Such people must love not only technology but also everything else in Japan.
Citing bass, making a vasabby meal, collecting catacombs and wearing your girlfriend - not in kimonos, of course, but in Japanese street fashion cannons: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Please, the Japanese school form is the only form that girls carry with pleasure and after school.
She has amazing qualities, both sensitive and strict.
And the older the girl, the more beautiful the short.
The main change in the outer appearance of CX-5 is a radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But where the shape of the car changes more strongly, the new picture of the lamp and the rear lamps that the car is currently learning about in the flow of the car.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
Siluette is harmonious, sensitive, but the outside is rigid.
There's no need to call the police.
According to CX-5, one of the safest in the world can experience only steady Japanese peace.
The 2.2 litre diesel engine provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
In addition, the fuel consumption of this engine is 175 L.C. - a total of 5.9 L.A. The power unit shall be completed exclusively by automatic transmission and full output.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this picture, you can select leggins with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you are not in the position of your own DTP in CX-5.
In order to enhance comfort, while maintaining excellent governance, the linings have been reworked with the design of front and rear dampers, as well as optimized the shape of the front and rear sleeves.
The full delivery system is adapted under Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13 per cent.
The bathroom in the flower or strip is as boring as the budget seat.
It's another thing, if the girl is growing up in a bathroom with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the caste.
Her attention will then be no less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 improves the design of both front and rear seats, providing optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs.
Long-term researchers will appreciate the fact that the emphasis on the front of the central tunnel is now soft and does not hit the sides of the expressions.
The broadest set of active safety systems in Mazda is proposed at CX-5.
The radar, lasers and cameras are used here to identify the potential threat.
There is both adaptive lighting and a warning of the exit from the strips, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda's CX-5 is one of the best in the class.
The comfortable, with minimum performances, places a load of 561 litres. The rear seat consists of a ratio of 4:2:4 - each section is provided with a separate output bar - and increases the luggage compartment to 1560 litres.
The costume of a multifilm hero in Japan is called the “sygurums”.
It's especially nice to look like a peacock.
It can do anything!
Of course you're asleep.
But having a good time with little kids.
Or just walk around like that on the street...
It's so cool when it's possible to choose a dress, a manner of behavior or a car.
Thank you for your assistance in preparing the Kawaicat store material.
Kiev broke the atomic union.
Kiev formally rejected Ukraine ' s cooperation with Russia on the Hmelnik AES.
The Supreme Council, on Wednesday, voted in favour of the dissolution of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements for the incorporation of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project could not be started.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed a law derogating from the agreement with RF in 2010-2012 on the construction of the third and fourth block at the Hmelnik AES.
The draft law introduced by the Government was successful only after the second vote, with the first support of 210 MPs, at a minimum of 226, but then, when the draft was re-elected, 234 members of parliament said.
The initial project Hmelnik AES was to have four 1 GWt energy blocks with VWER-type reactors, but only two were able to build.
Negotiations with Moscow on accession led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and in 2011-2012 the Council adopted the relevant laws.
Since there was no funds in the Ukraine budget, it was assumed that building blocks would be necessary for the Russian side to borrow, but the funds had not been allocated.
Following the return to Kiev in February 2014 and subsequent cooling in relation to the two countries, Kiev began to renegotiate relations with Moscow in the nuclear sector, declaring its refusal to cooperate on the Kmelnik nuclear plant and on the project of construction in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have been maintained was the purchase of RF fuel for the current Ukrainian AES (almost half of the country's electricity generation) as long as the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoat" replaced Russian supplies with something.
The plans of the Hmelnik AES and the other contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively rejected: negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev in 2014.
The UN gender against the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
During the press conference, UN Secretary-General Pan Ki-moon reported that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," the AP answers to the question about the military support of Syria by Russia.
Mr. Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the mid-level United Nations permanent members later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Vice-President of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Bogdanovski, reported that the possibility of the future establishment of the Syrian VAS base was not excluded.
Not yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanowski.
Previously, U reported that the United States did not trust President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the FY-banned terrorist group, the Islamic State.
For more details on the US' doubts about Russian assistance to Syria, read in "U" material "Russian military presence in Syria concerns Washington."
In PA, OSCE reports on a possible meeting of parliamentarians from Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE, Arthur Gerasim, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in south-east Ukraine.
"What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," says Mr. Gerasimova.
He also called for mine agreements and for “returning to the normal viability of our countries”.
The question of whether it is possible, in his view, to present a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, either in a “Normand format” or in a contact group at the OSCE PA site, Mr. Gerasims noted that the dialogue had been conducted, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, politicians said that in Kiev they supported any kind of dialogue.
The former representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, the former President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk republics had basically not changed their positions in the tripartite negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Electoral Commission of Lower Novorod held elections in the municipal district, distributing 12 parliamentary mandates played by party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of election violations were made by representatives of CRC who accused the election of “covering falsifications”.
The opposition ' s comments were not adopted.
Together, he rejected the Russian Communist Party in a referendum on the abolition of payment for the capremont of multi-quarter houses.
The City Election officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Lower Novegorod in the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million people were included in the list of voters in Lower Novgorod, 746.7,000 in ballot papers were issued to the local commissions, and 268 thousand voters were voted in.
More than 11.7,000 ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "One Russia" six prominent MPs include Dmitry Svatkovski, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasil Supranova, Elizavete Solonchenko, Wiacheslav Rasteriev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given by the leader of the Vladimir Girinovski party.
Two CRC mandates are divided between Vladimir Bulanov and Mr. Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "Just Russia" are given to Alexander the Tomb, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Within five days, these candidates will have to determine whether they will work as representatives of the city: in the event of a waiver of the mandate, they will move to the next party candidate.
The President of Gorizbiercom, Alexander Makeev, informed the members of the commission that he had introduced a mandate to "send telegrams to Girinovski and others" to refuse mandates.
In the adoption of the electoral outcome protocol, the representatives of CRC reported multiple violations.
A member of the Gorizbirco with the right to vote by CRC, Leonid Krasnokutski, proposed not to recognize the outcome of the vote in four districts No.21-24, recalling that, under the direction of the Head of the Administration of the Soromese Region, the entrance to the administration building was closed, with four district commissions.
Within a long time, the Os MPs could not go through the smokes, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, and the resonance scandal with the back door of the administration was shown on the television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend.
Their head had ceased access only when the vote was completed and the district commissions had not yet arrived to submit their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"The head was corrected, and interested persons could be present at all meetings," said a member of the Andrhushin poll.
The Communists objected that the blocked administrative building had illegally detained the deputy of the Human Mile Aristov Assembly for more than four hours, which was the subject of a statement to the committee of inquiry.
The opposition also objected that, on the day of the elections, a number of WICs began to seal the urns at 6-7 in the morning, giving them their ballots for an early vote.
The members of the Committees with the right to vote and observers had not been notified, so they had already arrived at the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
Communists are convinced that at morning hours before the polling stations were opened in the urns, ballots could be thrown in uncontrollable.
However, by a selection of more than 124 complaints for various reasons, Alexander Makeev said that no violations of the release of unrecorded ballots had been found.
Members of the Commission and his colleague Maria Popov's proposal from "Just Russia" did not support the adoption of amendments to the regional legislation, so as to make it clear that the time had come to open up the envelopes with the ballots of the early vote, which then fell into the urn.
"To your own initiative, contact the CIC at least," said Ms. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CRC, Sergey Samohin, who called for the election to ignore the dozens of complaints and to cover electoral frauds, broke down.
"You're not here at the meeting. Be careful!" the election president was offended.
The protocol was finally approved almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the general results of the elections should be approved, after which the first meeting of the City Hall of Lower New York of the Sixth Assembly will be held within three weeks.
In addition to determining the election results, the City Electoral Commission rejected the political party of the Communists of Russia in registering an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were about to discuss two issues: do they agree that the charges for multi-dwelling must be “removed immediately” and the rates for housing and community services should be “frozen by 2020”.
However, Irina Maslov's lawyer explained that the treatment of the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
FedEx is a mixed character, a decrease in forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported the inconvenient results of the last quarter, and the supply service giant reduced the annual income forecast due to the drop in demand for freight services and increased costs in its land transport compartment.
The company also stated that it planned to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares amounted to about 2.5 per cent in the preliminary trades 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he was planning to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, which was 20 cent less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast is reduced despite a rise in average rates of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in the charges for the land transport of heavy or tidal goods, which starts in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase the yield compared to last year by reducing costs, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “worked stablely against the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and world trade”.
The work force plans for the holidays were announced the following day after the competition's declaration, UPS, that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 staff, approximately as much as they had been employed last year.
For the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44, for the Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $1.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a fall in the fast-track international transport sector, leading to a lack of gross income in its transportation unit.
However, the purchase boom on the Internet has greatly improved the results of the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the cost of land transport rose by 29 per cent, but operating revenues remained largely unchanged due to increased costs of large-scale delivery and self-insurance.
The express transport unit received higher income due to higher basic rates, while income in the freight sector fell due to increased wage costs.
In the preliminary trades, about an hour before the opening of the FedEx stock exchange, it fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed on Tuesday, falling by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the record on 11 June.
At the most expected meeting in a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduras red tree, deciding whether to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end, a very decorated two-storey meeting room would write a vivid picture of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, must place the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double commission from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have acknowledged that there is also a third unwritten order: financial stability.
And this third commission may be an unknown factor in the almost projected decision, which will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to get rid of the unprecedented stimulus provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show a strong growth in the economy, recent shocks on world financial markets may also keep the federal system's leaders as cautious as ever from adding volatility by raising the federal fund base rate even at only the fourth percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will become the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Pegza, chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"At the same time, I think that if they wanted reason not to raise the rate of increased uncertainty around the world market, it would be enough to give them the excuse to wait any longer," she noted.
There is no consensus about what they are doing in the Federal Reserve System, which in itself is causing a fluctuation in the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently in Bloomberg predicted an increase in the rate of interest this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to refrain from this, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent probability of rapid take-off.
This may lead to a decrease in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that decision makers do not mitigate the impact of the promise that the next increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dou-Johns index rose to 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The flight was prompted by expectations that those determining the federal system strategy would leave the stake this week, said John Lonski, the main economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research group.
"It'll be a surprise if the Federal system increases rates at this point in time," he noted.
If the Federal Reserve System is to do so, “they will have to go far into adopting their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they do not panic”.
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate could calm down financial markets, as this would remove uncertainty about how the Federal system would operate.
A whole month ago, the Federal system appears to have been inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small step in slowing down financial conditions, which could confirm the stability of US recovery.
Yellow stated in the spring and early summer that she was expecting an increase in the rate this year, despite the Liberal complaints that there was a need for greater economic progress.
Although new jobs had slowed in August, the growth in the labour market had been stable this year.
Unemployment has declined to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest rate in more than seven years, and at almost the level considered to be full employment in the Federal system.
Increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the target of 2 per cent of the annual average by the central bank, the Federal System's leadership stated that the temporary impact of the sharp fall in oil prices was a key factor.
The economy “can and needs higher rates in view of labour market decline”, noted Ian Sheferdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaking at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dou-Johns Average Index for Industrial Companies has fallen to 16 per cent of the world ' s market share in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market has partially restored its positions this month, and the Dou-Johns index is now about 10 per cent lower than the May.
In order to guide the Federal Reserve System, market distortion further complicates the difficult calculations of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of any information on what has happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would be turning their backs on this meeting,” said Steven D. Oliner, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve System Officer.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will at least wait a month to get more control over the consequences.
“There is great uncertainty about what the impact of the US economy may have, and they almost have no reliable data after the recent developments in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Federal System, and it should not be technically taken into account when taking these decisions.
But in essence, the Federal Reserve System has become the world financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Only one sign from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could "absorb" its monetary expansion caused market shocks around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, leaders of the Federal Reserve System could be expected not only to monitor developments everywhere but also to consult representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process, “s rather art than science”, noted Zakari Karabell, head of Investnet Inc., who is engaged in global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there have been cases of excessive reaction to the movements of the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, insisting on an increase in the rate, provided an example of decisions 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia has resulted in the federal system lowering its base rate by 0.75% for three meetings, “with limited identified implications for US growth”, said Laker.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System cancelled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve System should be the first to address stability only in times of major crises, such as market collapse in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last panic didn't get close to that level, he said.
"Of course, you wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of rising rates because of the shock of markets," said Pozen, President of the Peterson Institute of World Economics.
The Federal Reserve System Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I do not think that they should avoid events.

Speaker Mr. Sergey Narrishkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East, so that the waves of refugees flock to Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed such an opinion to journalists in Ulan-Bator during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question is whether Europe is the ultimate goal of those who have destabilised the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with such manic persistence in recent years?" he asked.
"It is likely that someone expected and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and helpless people who are saved from death, will be pursued in the EU's welfare countries," he added.
Narishkin wondered: "Did many European political leaders openly express the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally ravaging their countries?"
"No, old Europe, except rarely, prefers to be silent," he noted.
According to Narishkin, NATO supports many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially seen and looked at how the military soap, which is protected by NATO standards, is also embellished by moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” said the speaker.
By government troops and their loyal military formation, the opposition of rebels was mainly of the Islamists.
Later, the "Islamic State" terrorist group in Russia joined the Syrian Government's opponents.
The United States of America supports rebels who oppose both Assad and IH.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria called the cause of the hostile West towards Russia.
Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact sovereign States.
This was the opinion expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign States.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, who would act for Western countries, not for his family, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp upheaval of Western media as a result of the revolution in Ukraine.
According to him, Russian President Vladimir Putin "has become an enemy of the West, a king, a dictator who oppresses the Russian opposition, which has come to power in a democratic way, despite being elected as a result of the democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin urged the world community to unite forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West ' s constant statements that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people through the elections, and if so on the request of the people, not on the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, and otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad referred to Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled their cooperation.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking of Iran's military support, the Syrian leader noted that it supported the Syrian State in its policies, in its economy and in its military sphere.
He rejected the claim that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tegeran is supplying us with military technology.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been," he explained.
With regard to the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a strong desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of a so-called anti-terrorism and anti-gill coalition known as the United States," said Assad.
The number of deaths exceeded 230 thousand, the number of refugees being 11.5 million.
Part of the territory seized the terrorist group " Islamic State " banned in Russia.
The International Coalition, headed by the United States, is hit by air IH.
12 people were killed in Utah by the floods.
In the U.S. state of U.S., at least 12 people died as a result of the floods.
Another one is considered missing, transmitted by Fox 13 Salt Lake City.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
The U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, had a telephone conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the John Kirby Department.
It is noted that the topic of the discussion was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any further details.
He said that the United States had instruments for “the further isolation of Russia”, if it supported President Bashar Assad of Syria, transmitted the RIA News.
As reported by the Russian MIDI, Lavrov again stressed the need to establish a single front against terrorist groups operating in the country.
There were also discussions on ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tension on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were addressed.
Previously, U.S. officials stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about the strengthening of Moscow ' s support for Assad.
In Washington, Russia stated that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the Russian President's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said that the country would not enter international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist organization, the Islamic State.
The International Coalition, headed by the United States, is subject to IG's air strikes.
Borodai called the U.S. newspaper the name of the shooting.
The former President of the Government of the self-declared Donetsk People ' s Republic, Alexander Borday, rejected the information published in The Washington Post.
He said that in a phone interview with the correspondent, "Lenty.ru."
The note in Washington Post is wonderful that everything is completely over-reached.
The former Minister of Defence of the DNR Igoriya Shootkova, of course, did not connect and "extended" him from the territory of the Republic of Donbass in a very subordinate attitude, without chains, without three furs of money attributed to him by different characters," he said.
According to Borodya, the thing about Shooting in a conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper really went.
"Yes, I said that the Arrow was urgently required to withdraw from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of the Government of the DND.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that the Arrows were taken to the Russian territory of the “linked”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, it's amazingly misunderstood words, because I stressed that the Arrows were gone by themselves," said Borodai.
"That's a curse on me and on the arrow," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post, an article was published stating that Borodya had taken the Arrow to the territory of Russia in a coercive manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had to tie up his associate.
The Polish authorities have begun to search for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish forests have begun to cut trees over the underground tunnel, where it is reported that there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work began on Tuesday, 15 September, Reuters reported.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear forests in order to verify the reliability of railway communications with riches.
Within the train, there can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Lower Silesia Tomasz Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) assumed that new evidence of the existence of a train with gold would not be more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to block the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland Petr Petr Žuhovski said that local depositors with "a 99 per cent probability" had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich mentioned in the legends.
Jukhovski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the values were discovered, they would be the property of the state penalty, while the treasures would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two legal firm clients approached the authorities of the Polish city of Valbži with a message that they found a train in a frozen tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The main drugologist, RF, proposed banning the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21.
The Russian Chief Narcotics suggested banning the sale of tobacco up to 21 years.
Eugenien Brun noted that before that age, “loved psychoactive substance — tobacco, alcohol, drugs — is particularly harmful”.
So he said in the direct atmosphere of the Moscow Radio Station, commenting on the fact that the speaker of Sofed Valentin Matvinko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens for less than 21 years.
Man is growing unevenly.
You can serve in the army for 18 years, you know, physically ready.
He has been mentally ready for full life in society for 21 years.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry finally accumulates by only 21 years," said Brun.
Former member of the Public Chamber and head of the project "Tressya Russia" Sultan Hamzaev reported to the "Reports", that Matwienko supported the initiative to increase the age of alcohol sales and agreed to "re-raise this issue again with the Public Chamber at the top of the House of Parliament".
According to the activist, the Council of the Federation will soon establish a working group to draft a bill under the leadership of Matwienko.
The Bible has been asked to verify compliance with the Children’s Information Protection Act
The resident of Novosibirska asked the regional prosecutors to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law on the protection of children from information that harms their health and development, as stated by correspondent Sib.fm on 16 September.
The author stated that on August 26, 2015, he bought a Bible at the Chinese City Store in the Red Box, published by the Russian Bible Society in 2013.
In the book, he found fragments that he considered to be in violation of the FZ “On the Protection of Children from Information That Causes Health and Development”.
On 16 September, a statement was made to the Office of the Prosecutor of Novosibirsk.
The response to the treatment of the inhabitants of Novosibirska will take 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
Much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the complainant commented on the correspondent Sib.fm.
Furthermore, it is a fundamental problem that will weaken society.
It will then begin to read the Bible, which has not been done before.
Brazil's Rio Grand Paediatric Union promotes healthy breast feeding
The Brazilian Paediatric Organization SPRS has devised a scandalous method to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breast feeding: the method implies demonstration of the images of infants who are breast-feeding.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended to increase the daily calorie rate by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor of medicine at the Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing swelling.
Unfortunately, negative effects of unhealthy nutrition on the immune system of the child have been found.
Under Hamburg, a school bus broke down.
Near Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus that stopped on the railway.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing that he could not get off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had an eye attack.
One of the school students shot him on the video.
There was a panic among the students as a result of an accident.
Some children began to cry and run away from the neighborhood.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was affected by a miracle except for one passenger on the train who was injured easily.
Accidental damage was estimated at €300,000.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of the young local sportsman David Brown.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of a single trauma with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the victory of Magali in the 12th round.
Brown went to a brain trauma hospital.
Its status was considered critical and was connected to life-saving equipment.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in destruction.
He's got two kids left.
This is already the second case of the Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student named Bradon Smith graduated from the trauma at the ring.
Now, AMA recommends that this type of sport should not be dealt with, but rather, from its point of view, should be banned.
I understand this is happening unintentionally, said Vice-President of Steven Parniss.
But in the way that there is a box now, there will always be situations where a sportsman gets bleeding or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that combines practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin urged PA OSCE to abolish sanctions against RF parliamentarians.
Speaker of the RF spokesperson Sergey Narishkin called the imposition of sanctions on parliamentarians.
He said that he was speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulan-Bator.
We consider this to be an unacceptable act, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political insanity and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue,” said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the Russian and EU partnership.
Let's return morals to politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let's return humanistic ideals to democratic peace order.
"Dublin never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian House called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
"First, to solve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Narishkin said.
He also noted the need to pay tribute to the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common area where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan-Batoror and will be extended until 18 September.
He enjoyed winning a few or three days.
The World Championship on Light Athletics Sergei Shubenko.
This season can be called a triumphal for a 24-year-old lightweight athlete from Barnaul Sergey SUBENKOWA.
He managed at his crowning distance 110 meters with barriers to win the European championship, to establish several records, and mainly to become a champion of peace, the first in the history of the national barrier.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final “Brilliant League”, taking the third place in general.
The News asked Shubenko to share the impressions of the declining season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to go to the World War Games, which will take place in October in Korea, and then I'm going to think about rest.
The truth is, I'm going to be ready now for home in Barnaul, and to be home is a different situation.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
At the end of August, the beginning of September was a wonderful time.
The passions after the main start of the season are cut off, and the load of responsibility is no longer drained.
We can compete for pleasure, for "slaboone."
Plus, you know, let's just...
What about fatigue?
However, the season is special, the mass of positive emotions...
The season's getting tired of it all the time.
And it doesn't matter what he did more than win or lose.
Every competition is a stress.
Permanent crossings, crossings, all of this isn't going to go on forever.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
Well, I'm just happy!
By the time they finished the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It's happening.
Yeah, and you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But in general, I think it's wrong for a sportsman who lives with old victories to turn his successful races over and over again.
He enjoyed the victory for a few or three days and had to move on.
Was the preparation for this remarkable season very different from the usual?
I can't say there was something so special.
We got ready in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He trained at home in Barnaul first, then at the meetings, then at home again.
It's normal.
But the coach and I were asked to try to get to a new level that I haven't been to yet.
Almost all the winter time was spent building a base.
They ran a bunch of crossbows, they did a physical training exercise, which included both the weight and the seat and the back.
Then, after taking in barrier training, they took care of a lot of technology.
Did you watch the rivals talk?
I'm always trying to do this, and the good of the Internet age is no problem with it.
He saw the Winter European Championship, and the French took the whole Pedestal in the barrier!
I was thinking, there's something we need to do, break up this company.
With each start in this season, you added and added results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons on the same chart.
It's not like I'm running at 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always twist my shape gradually.
The main thing you wanted to do is avoid 13 seconds.
All the work was directed primarily towards this outcome.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready for the promotion, and in the competitions you're willing to show up, you don't always get it.
How was that, for example, at the London Olympics?
If it's true, this semifinal run (Subenkov couldn't get to the final.
It was pretty good, I could really escape in 13 seconds.
Even if he had repeated his best result at that point, he would have become the bronze scene of the Game.
But it wasn't lucky.
Remember your first world championship?
How?
It was in Teg.
I really wanted to get to the final, it was a maximum program.
And he got away from tomorrow, in the preliminary races.
Then he realized that breaking and breaking his head meant no one to escape.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow, he was in the finale with a better time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the gold by then!
How do you know when you're building a speed, not losing your head, not turning off?
And that's the most complicated thing.
You need to be very accurate, focused on technology so that you don't break the barriers.
He noticed that when you focus on the outcome, the process is so much easier.
And when you feel like you're running, it's like you're getting yourself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our deep-rooted athletes have tried to move closer to the capital after their first serious successes.
Has there never been such a thought?
It's even better at home.
Yes, and I don't imagine where I am without my coach, who do I need?
Maybe it would be better to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
C you've been cursed for a long time?
12 years, since he got into the easy athletics.
In fact, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then in the length of the nail, with a triple.
It was a child polygamy, it was when the ball was being drawn, it was floating away from the place...
At 14, he tried running with the barriers, and I liked it.
From the first run, the rules of the second adult level have been met.
That's it.
There was never a fear of barriers?
Somehow it was possible to deal with them.
But technology has always had to work very hard.
It's been a hell of a pain in the ass!
But this routine doesn't go anywhere.
The technique has to be turned on all the time, so that I can wake up at night, I get up right away and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claims it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
Usually I don't review my runaways, and I couldn't stay here.
But there is no room for improvement.
Don't you worry now that winning the Olympics a year before the Olympics is a heavy load?
As they say, I will try to justify my expectations.
Once he has chosen this path, he must go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you shouldn't feel any extra cargo.
And I totally agree with him.
Othar Kushanasville
Well, I'm not so naive to be fooled by the reaction to an interview in Ukraine.
People are sick, I understand. They don't eat their bread. Come on, let's go.
And even though I wasn't wearing a flag, and that's the same thing, a million times I've been talking here, and I haven't called anyone directly, I've got another job.
All my pseudo-friends are in the middle of nowhere in a second.
The pressure that I'm exposed to is so strong that even I, who's the type of paranoia, I think people are dressed in white.
It's like he's gone, he's gone, and he's got a crowd on you, and he's got a lot of fun.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a doll, I'm out of my mouth, old man, I'm afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have an illusion, and now...
I've always had better self-sufficiency, so enjoy it.
And giving passports to people like Fred Derst or Monson can only be a fool.
I'd rather be a better journalist than a loser.
A week ago, in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described the Crimea in a severe way:
What they did with the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call the annexation.
I think that the reference to how the Subsidiary of the Crusades tried to sign something is never included in the common picture of human habitation.
It's like coming to the neighbor and taking his place...
The Kremlin war is gone, and it's just going to end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started calling some kind of monster from the Kremlin wall.
I have a guess who this might be...
Cobzon's not so much alive.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, so he needs to lick Putin's hands.
What, he's losing his apartment?
Well, take his memory off.
Of course, the people remembered him as an insult to their little family.
And now reconciliation depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven is leading the rating despite the attempt of the Ninth to highlight the loss of leaders at Today's Show
Carl Stefanovich and Liza Wilkinson in Canberra to highlight the consequences of the Liberal Party's statement on the release of the leader's seat was not able to raise the rating today.
The 9th morning show was broadcast from the capital of the State after Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott's explosion.
The competitor, Sunrise, led by David Koh and Samantha Armitage, was arrested in London under a weekly international news series, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This torture seems to have had little significance for Australian television viewers, while the Sunrise audience included 397,000 viewers in five largest cities compared to Today's audience of 339,000.
Today took a little more than its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today's cut-off with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August today there were 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, there was a gap between 40,000 and 50,000.
Until September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers against 314,000 in Today.
That's the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa all right, thank you for explaining!
Today published on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news for the Seventh was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the former star series Packed to the Rafters Eric Thompson.
The new drama of the recently widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on board with his two children, has brought together an impressive audience of 1,219 million.
Critics reasoned whether Tomson could handle a popular show alone without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result is a loud yes.
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million, easily bypassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For the Seventh, the success and failure of Chase Australia was mixed up on the second night.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV set by Andrew O'Keefe gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) was up to 623 000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuyre (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half of the hour was a factor of 720 000.
Hot Seat has raised 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which couldn't play the McGuyre show.

The three finalists are unanimous in saying that "Holstack" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Is the secret open?
Lana Jevon-Fellouse, Sarah McKay and Snowman Marcoski may have been able to figure out which one of them will win in the Holostika.
The woman who is finally staying with Sam Wood in Holostika is surrounded by a secret curtain.
And the three girls who came to the final are, of course, still silent about which one of them got his last pink.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Markoskie and Lana Jevons-Falluse until the day the three girls will have to stay two, they may have surprisedly given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps quiet until the final, which will be Thursday.
All three women come in lyricism, explaining why Wood was the ideal man, referring to his sense of humor, zeal, family values, life-suffering as a reason why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question "If you don't, who should get the last of Wood's roses?" they could hardly tell which of them actually conquered the heart of Holostika.
Jevons-Falluse and Marcosky no doubt called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
From the very first day, good relations had developed between Sarah and Sam.
"Since I was among the participants, I felt the energy (Sarah) and Sam's energy and understood that they were very close to each other, and I didn't doubt it during the whole show," said Javans-Falluse.
"Sara's a very open man, easy and fun with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, there's really a attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks that she and Sam Wood will have a great couple.
Sam McKay said that because of last week's home visits, she realized that Wood might be the same person.
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it wasn't just a game - I trusted him with all my heart," she says.
To the question that Wood should choose, if it wasn't for her, she would answer in secret.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow and Lana deserve it to the same extent.
The Bachelor's show is on Wednesday at 19.30 on Channel Ten.

Jarred Heen had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after his move to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would leave Hayne on the rock for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian League of Regbi allowed for the first return of the ponta in the winning game with Minnesota with 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his play and gave Hayne another chance to return the pand, as well as to engage him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed up on the right side and after the game, in the separate.
Instead of creating a distribution of newbies in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Heine at the press conference after the match.
The Special Rapporteur at the 49ers Club, Cam Inman, reported that Heine had also received support from the Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarred Hayne lost his ball on the back of the panda with the Minnesota Vikings command during the first quarter.
At the beginning of such a debut, the NHL Hayne and his many Australian worshipers clearly did not count.
It was evident that Hayne was making fun of leaving the field after the ball was lost, and later he told the leading show "Hemish and Andy" at the Australian 2DayFM 104.1 radio station, which he couldn't imagine a more unsuccessful start for his NFL career.
"That's what happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," he said.
Hein compared his career with his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when the ballbroker in his starting zone tried Quinceland.
Finally, this experience proved very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Heine took a picture of the Australian flag and fans after the game and took a picture of Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Michael Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at the risk of using weapons at the Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yokos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
There have been clashes on the Hungarian border with the police.
The refugees launched protests at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian population point of Reske, which had grown up in clashes with law enforcement officers.
As a result, the Hungarian police have used water and liquefied gas, transmitted by Reuters.
The migrants throw away police stones and try to remove the border guard.
Support is being sought for the site of the clashes and police are taking action in response to the attacks by migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, refugees were able to cross the police border, after which tens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Hungarian-Serbian border by bus to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, Bi-bi-sy reports.
The authorities of the countries allowed migrants to come to Croatian territory and to transport them from there to the country they needed.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, Hungary ' s parliament stepped up its legislation on migration and border protection.
Corrections include participation by the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those illegally crossing the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for examining asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already recognized one migrant guilty of an illegal crossing of the Hungarian-Serbian border and will therefore be deported and unable to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider soon the transfer of functions to the Hungarian armed forces to protect the country's parliament.
At the end of June, Hungary started construction of a 175-km-long fence on the border with Serbia to prevent the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian acknowledged that the largest in the history of the United States was cyberattack.
The Russian cyberattack, Vladimir Drinkman, who was accused of stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers in the U.S. history, reported Reuters.
During the trial in the Federal Court of New Jersey, Drinkman was admitted to the argument to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the Russian meeting, he spoke with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage suffered by the accused was estimated at $300 million.
“Respondents such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break our computer networks, are a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is threatened by 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a fine of millions of dollars.
In the case of a sentence, the court shall take into account the recognition of the Russian and may reduce the time limit.
Drinkman's conviction will be announced on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect, Dmitry Smilian, was arrested.
The latter denies his guilt for crimes he committed.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with Russia ' s support for Bashar Assad ' s regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian MIDI, Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, warned that Russian President Bashar Asada's support for Russia was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“ Secretary Kerry has made it clear that the Russian support of President Assad is likely to exacerbate and exacerbate the conflict, as well as undermine our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding solutions to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” says a communication published on the United States Host Department.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to combating the Islamic State (as banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary-General, Assad “will never be a reliable member” of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved by political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
The former Secretary of the White House, Joshua Ernest, threatened Russia with isolation if it did not cease to support Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed joining the international coalition, which is conducting an anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.
In recent times, the media have often reported the presence of Russian soldiers in Syria.
The head of the Russian MID, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and helped the Syrians to acquire the technique to use it against the Islamists.
Four were killed when police fired a reindeer gun at a protest in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police started shooting at the crowd with reindeer bullets protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official representative said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Katmandu, the capital of the country.
The district police chief Poshnad Dhakal reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered in one of the police offices, some had thrown stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reported that the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before firing the rifles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why resin bullets, which are known to be killed, are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have led to such a high mortality rate.
This conflict was the last few weeks of violent protests in the southern, northern part of Nepal, where the Madesi people ' s representatives said that the new provinces formed under the new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among the Taru people who wanted to have their own status.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on the new Constitution has been under way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted in favour of the articles of the draft constitution in Katmandu this week and the officials said that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Syansk plans to create an enterprise in 900 jobs.
Syansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a chemical industry centre, with developed infrastructure that required systemic support.
A year ago, Syansk led a new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He described the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the Field Correspondent.
Oleg Valerijevic, what did you start working as mayor?
First of all, I have been familiar with the results of audits of financial and business activities, and I have initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
A municipal property audit was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps has been to reduce document turnover to five days.
Earlier, the papers by the authorities could be held for months.
Efforts have been made to improve the income base and optimize expenditures.
Last November, a visit to Syanska was held to the Government, where the issues of the socio-economic development of the territory were addressed.
There was no project documentation (PSD) for any facility in the city.
Without that, Syansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started with the PSD on the road, the children's garden, the northern sewer and the plumber.
Road work on two sites is now underway.
How does the city comply with the order of President RF on the construction of children's gardens?
In July of this year, 105 children were born in Syanska.
This positive demographic has not been seen in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of safe places in children ' s gardens is one of the most relevant today.
Since 1 September, the capital repair of the Children ' s Village No. 10 has been closed to 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has not yet received such funds.
Last year, after repairs, a children's garden No. 23 was opened, which now visits 200 children.
The refurbishment was made under the conditions of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, worth more than 67 million rubles.
Through the efforts of the administration and assistance of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment have been sought, and the People's Initiative programme has also been assisted.
There are plans to start building a new child now in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children between half and three years of age.
We don't have a set for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city must be done, above all, by the Chinese companies, that it is the job they need to do.
A 60-quarter house for orphans in the Leningrad micro-region is already being put into operation in October.
With regard to construction, I would add that Syansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria, which has entered the class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will begin in the near future.
We have declared the construction of 10,000 sq.m. housing for those wishing to participate in the programme very much.
One of the conditions is that the housing must be less than 30,000 rubles per square metre, which is part of the "underkey" section.
If we deal with the required amounts, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In its time, the Syan Pig Complex was built on the territory, which was sold for free in 2004.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to challenge this deal.
More than land under the property is federal property.
Working with Moscow, the issue of the transfer of 88 g to regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is willing to invest in reconstruction and launch a 1.5 billion rubles project.
With a pig gun, we'll have 900 jobs, which will be a big support for the city.
Is the Institute of Social Partnership developed in Syanska?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Efficient support is provided by enterprises such as the East-Centr SAO, the New-Ziminian TEC, the Sanskrit Broiler OOOO, and the IMF OOO, the management of these enterprises is responding to all treatments.
Directly to the day of the OOO city, the Saanski broiler gave the city a children's town, the East-Center company repaired a horse court where specialists deal with children with ill-treatment, costing more than 1 million rubles.
The sponsorship has helped to build up the territory of the city of SAGA.
The sponsors helped to mark the City’s Day beautifully.
As in ancient times, a parade was held with the participation of urban communities and organizations.
The city’s lythography, a book by the Chinese poets, was published.
Jewelry medals have been held by the first builders and people who have made a major contribution to the development of Syanska.
The mezenates are also involved in the urban welfare fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
Over the next nine months, over 800 thousand rubles are aimed at supporting talented children, helping children in need of expensive treatment, and supporting children from underage families.
How are social staff problems addressed in Syanska?
There's not enough doctors in the city and teachers.
The provision of housing professionals is of great importance in addressing the staffing issue.
Last year, we had five doctor’s apartments, and four teachers were assigned to the office.
We're working on a housing program with the opportunity to privatize it in five years.
Plans are to replan the building, which will build another eight homes for the educators.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the Russian family home program.
In the future, the building of a house for budgetary workers.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city that I can handle the most complex issues.
It is important to make the right conclusions out of all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of China and our region is great.
Dumu introduced a bill on the indexation of savings in the light of price increases.
The House introduced a bill to index social pensions annually as from 1 February in the light of price increases.
The author of the document, a Member of the “Justice Russia” Alexander Lomakin-Romanian, also proposes to carry out an additional pension index on 1 April if the rate of growth of the living minimum exceeds the rate of increase in prices for goods and services.
Indication of pensions, under existing legislation, is carried out annually as from 1 April, taking into account the rate of increase in the minimum pensioner ' s life in the RF over the past year.
The draft law introduced into the lower court provides for the introduction of a social pension index, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first index shall be carried out on 1 February and the second one shall be carried out on 1 April.
Chapter PA OSCE stated that Mogerini was not allowed to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogerina, the speaker of PA OSCE, Ilkka Canerva, stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the assembly were not allowed.
The journalists were informed by a member of the Russian delegation at the OSCE PA autumn session in Ulan-Batore Nikolai Kovalev.
In support of Cannerva's position, it is reported that the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were collected, including representatives of Germany.
"There has already been enough strong support," Kovalev said.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA spoke with the intention of collecting signatures of MPs who indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians were not allowed.
In particular, he noted Kovalev, Canerva promised to raise the problem to the level of the EU's governing structures and to “send the relevant petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Bridge is 60 per cent
The wide front of the low-pressure area is about 350 miles (560 km) south of the islands of the Green Measles, with the probability of 60 per cent turning into a tropical cycle for the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre reported on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined low pressure area between the Green Bridge and the Small Antilles is also 60 per cent likely to form a tropical cyclone within the next two days, synaptics from Miami reported.
Google launches a double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a twin-off campaign for the collection of $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping the countries of Europe to flee the war-torn and unaccompanied countries.
Google used a characterless personal approach, announcing a donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google employee Rita Masoud, who was fleeing from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We were going on questionable trains and buses, suffering from hunger, thirst, hunger and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has increased, many people, like my family, desperately need help.
Contributions will be made to four non-commercial organizations dealing with refugees and migrants: " Doctors without borders", the International Committee of Rescue, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on the google.com/refugeerelief page reached $11 million.
Europe is facing the strongest crisis with refugees since World War II, which has caused much of the four-year civil war in Syria, resulting in more than 4 million deaths this year.
Many are also fleeing from the wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetes with low obesity can help with obesity
The beneficial effect of post-indigestion surgery in people with low indigestion with type 2 diabetes may be at least five years long, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to claim that low-fat diabetics live longer after the obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"Death statistics are not available immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the JAMA Surgery editor's column.
Fatigue surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce the hunger and limit the ability of the organs to consume food.
In a few years, Bariatric Surgery demonstrated its effectiveness in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies were conducted among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (IMT) of 35 or more.
IMT, a measure of weight for growth, is considered normal with a value of 18.5 to 24.9.
ICT 25 or above says that people have excessive weight and people with ICT over 30 are considered people with obesity.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - stomach sneezing and coughing, with type 2 diabetes treatment in low-fat people.
The mean importance of IMT for those undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT remains at approximately 29.
Of those who had undergone surgery, 36% had been fully treated and 28% had been partially treated.
In the treatment group, only 1% and only about 2% were treated with complete diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LPNP cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors say.
Researchers also monitored the levels of hemoglobin A1s in the blood, which reflect levels of sugar in the blood in the dynamics.
Gemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, according to researchers.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9 per cent to approximately 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8 per cent.
However, better glycaemic control rates, reflected by good haemoglobin levels of A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi Cheng Su and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to a group with manual gastrectomy, the screening group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), increased IMT decreases (with 7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1s (3.1% versus 2.1 per cent), and was closer to complete diabetic remission (46.9 per cent versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method for a period of five years, there is evidence from the study of excess body mass in Sweden that surgical treatment actually increases the duration of life, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine, at the University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish survey of people with obesity who had chosen bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with ICTs below 35 interested in such procedures.
“The report is very important here, as it claims that such surgical intervention is safe in a low-IMT group where there is no increased risk of mortality or infectious diseases,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to be serious about weight as soon as the IMT reaches the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they come up with the genetic changes that start eating and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to turn it back.
There were 9 million rubles taken from the shed and 9 million rubles in the mines.
There were 9 million rubles and three women's shoes in the mines.
This is reported by Interfax with reference to the IMF press service.
The incident happened on Tuesday morning.
Two unknowns entered the house on the street of Gorgo, tied the 20-year-old son by the housekeeper and, threatening with both knives, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three shoes.
According to the preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, a criminal case under the heading “War”.
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to the 2018 World Football Championship.
Other hotels are not yet in a hurry to obtain the appropriate authorization.
According to experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the premonition of world domination, the authorities will have to think urgently about how to accommodate all the guests of the city.
The interviewers of Rosbalta believe that the cost of renting the plot will grow by 10-30 per cent, and that after the championship for the plot will have to be paid over.
The World Football Championship has made the authorities pay attention to the status of Russian hotels.
Under the law specifically written under priority, each Petersburg hotel must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is now clear that this will not be done by all: the waiters are so afraid of checking that they often do not send documents to the request of the Federal Antitrust Service for Petersburg.
According to UFAS head Wadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and is now planning to conduct 34 hotel cases, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-immony authorities.
There is a sign that the management of three tenths of companies has been misleading by the citizen, placing some of the stars in the advertisement, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now, literally, every number can't be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, the patients will take all the Petersburg hotels.
In the city, tourists can now count on 30,000 numbers.
According to Small, in Petersburg, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel, 100-two-three-star, 550-one-star.
According to the first Deputy Committee on Tourism Development, only 23 hotels have been classified at the moment, so many checks have been carried out by the companies accredited in Petersburg.
This is whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure in regional enterprises that is not known to the Small after-supply circumstances.
That is, the previous classification may be more, but no one knows about it.
"The last half-years have not been very eager to be classified," said the Director of the Russian Union's Northwest Office of the Ekaterin Shadsky Tournament.
This is due to a high season during which hotels make the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is budgets that have not been budgeted for verification, and the procedure can be maintained by the hotel depending on the status of between 30 and 100 thousand rubles and more.
However, hotel managers have recently stepped up and started applying for classification, as Shadsky has confirmed.
Hotels should succeed before 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine but will not yet be allowed to work on the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed fee will be made for the hotel number during the tournament.
The formulas to be calculated will be published in the following year.
This has been done so as not to allow prices to rise by 200-300 per cent, as is the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and not let it grow twice or three times, but we also need to let our hotels earn.
"I think there will be a 50% increase," explained the President of the Russian Hospital Association of Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Wadim Vladimirov is not convinced that price fixing is in line with market economy.
I don't know how much it goes into economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's a better unsustainable journey," he said.
It's not clear what's going to happen with popular cheap hotels.
Members of the House have introduced a bill that prohibits hotels in homes.
We very much hope that this law will not be passed or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that the hostages must be kept," thinks Nana Guachia.
However, she said that the owners of the mini-hospitals should in any case be prepared to strengthen the Housing Code.
If the House still approves the bill, about 80 per cent of the hotels will be closed in Petersburg, with 1.5 thousand numbers at the moment.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hoteleries North-West Leonid Garbar, in Petersburg, there are no two or three-star hotels, which have been hunted down by foot-and-mouth disease, and there are four and five-star hotels.
This is similar to the situation when “80,000 people sit at the 80,000 stage”.
This can be corrected by mini-hospitals.
Their possible ban is considered "idiotism," "I think it's strange that some people can live in the flats, and that's why they can't come."
If the hotel is used as a living room, I agree it's wrong.
But if the hotel where the guests arrive for a short time, why not?
Mini-hospitals are at risk of losing the world's football and because of their insatiability.
Hundreds of small cottages just don't pass the classification, and they're gonna kill themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordered.
“The companies that can carry out this procedure are not so much, so they will reject less paid orders from the mini-hotel and choose those who travel,” noted Gennadius Lamshin, adding that in some cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the rates of checks that have been carried out so far are much higher than those of Petersburg.
The cause of the Petersburg delay is related to permanent shifts in the Government ' s tourist block, which does not contribute to a coherent work.
In the opinion of the experts, if the Petersburg hotel is not enough, attention is likely to be paid to regional hotels and holiday homes.
As an example of the 300th anniversary of Petersburg in the city, a river fleet can be mobilized, that is, visitors to the tournament can live in cabins.
In addition, many patients will be prepared to arrive in trucks that can be nighttime.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels to let them go," said Gennady Lamshin.
Also, a high popularity during the football championship will benefit from collective housing.
Most likely, the city will create a reserve of housing.
Rent rates will grow by 10-30 per cent.
"From the obvious, the first will be housing near the stadium," said a specialist in the rental of the Agency for Development and Research in Larissa Bragin's real estate.
The rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the twin areas.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport solutions on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
There is no need to forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable town where people not only tell the road but can still take a mini-walk.
There are also complications.
In 1970 my father met a family from Murmansk, a father, a mother and two children in the yard.
They found it difficult to sleep in the garage at night.
"And my dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," recalled the interviewer.
True, he added that now such a curse in the city's inhabitants did not remain - to call his home the effects of the belly and the horrors.
But in 2018, after the failure of the House, will the failure of the hotelers and the governments have to be remembered?
Girinov's "slill" Amour area.
He was amazed to see the Girinovski clone in Gosmud today.
He did such things when our generation was just learning to trade newspapers and is still in a fine shape.
The topic of the statement, for example, was “LDR’s protest against the results of the Amur elections”.
Protocols do not shake; other protocols, other than those signed by the electors, have LDPR, in the opinion of the general public.
He raises up the second position of Ivan Abram and calls out to him, "This is the one who is the winner of the election."
And there's nothing going on here on the Rodney, and then, after the party with the president, it's going to put a fraction out of the meeting room, literally, "You're all with the fronts of your shells and gates."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abram, but on the scandal and demarcation of the factions as a result of the scandal and insult.
Real Wolfovic beautifully and elegantly merged the Amour area with Abraham.
For the whole country, this is a regular exit from the Girinovski style, but it is not a political party protest against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the elections, if you trust Ivan Abram's party and Facebook site, are not recognized, but the leader with the subject is clearly coming down.
It provides the dead in Amur to protect their dead, and it itself gives good news against the "One Russia" in general and nothing to be done by the Family.
It's a good decision not to lose a person, not to go into the present, not to show a scandal.
Another thing that is now being done in a strange situation is Abraham himself.
In addition to the fire from the beginning, he was not expected to have any alternative protocols.
He was not focused on public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, for the narrow circle, he was a formal cause and an insult to the respectable champion, and that, more sharply, he had a homicidal accident at the ER and the UNF.
And here, of course, he has to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the policy of region 2 and candidate number 1 for the only district-united district, he could become a successful party leader and super-hater for the same UNF and foreign party leader.
That's right, it wouldn't be Girin's, you should think about it, and you should respect it.
The trampo is still growing and growing before him.
News has appeared that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary session.
That's the bathroom falling out of nothing at all.
Only the theme of Abram's funeral.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's not possible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in her speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Cooperation Centre in Oxford on Ethics at the beginning of her 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He stated that in existing circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this was surprising, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said.
Although the Dalai Lama had taken a high turn on the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“The concern of thousands of refugees is wonderful, but at the same time you must think about the long-term decisions to bring this world and this development, mainly through education, into these Muslim countries”, he stressed.
At the end of the day, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush ' s actions following terrorist acts 9/11, stating that the United States had launched a series of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the problem could be solved through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it brought unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed a hand disinfectant over the past 4 years
Drug centres in the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed a high alcohol disinfectant, as reported by the drug centre of the state of Georgia.
According to Dr. Haylord Lopez, director of the toxicology centre of Georgia, cases of child swallowing up to 12 years of fluid for hand disinfection reported at toxicology centres have increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are more likely to contact these substances, and unfortunately some percentage of them are being sent to the emergency department,” said Lopes CNN.
He said that some children drank disinfectant fluid in particular, and some did so to impress their friends or to argue for social networks.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant fluid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents are reported to have mixed disinfectant fluid with alcohol-containing fluid for oral swallowing in order to obtain stronger drinks.
Younger children may be attracted to pleasant scents of disinfectant fluid.
"The baby doesn't think it can hurt him," Lopes reported.
Many of the most attractive (defective liquids for hands) are those that are aromatized.
There are disinfectant fluids for the hands with the smell of clubs, vineyards, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant fluid for the hands contains some 45 to 95 per cent of alcohol.
For young children, in particular, only a few outbreaks can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's a high-concentration spirit," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief doctor of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave a Scotch box, but people keep in mind these hand disinfectants, and if children get to them, it's a quick way to use a large amount of alcohol.
Nija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a disinfectant in her hands with a club aroma of about four drops, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
She had a level of alcohol in her blood 179, twice as much as an adult who was considered under the law to be an alcoholic, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, a medical emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Najija had broken her word and could not walk when she was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate clinic so as not to miss any signs of brain injury, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchie said.
"That was really scary," said CNN Orttoria Scott, Nidji's mother.
This could have been fatal for my child.
Lopes recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectants, as well as remove disinfectant fluids from the child ' s reach zone.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids link to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a non-toxic ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol as a lethal agent, not a body alcohol, which was identified as the active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the north of New York agreed to poison their “opposite” teacher by “dissemination of antibacterial substances in the class”, according to the police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy to hand disinfectants, and she banned them from being held in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was “empty discussions” and addressed issues of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children’s library in Barnaul, she became a family club.
On the back of the chimney at the entrance to the end of the children's library of N.K. Krupsky's sadistic swan.
The little ones who come after the books are trying to feed her with confetti.
For some generations, this library has been in existence for 95 years.
The first readers of the 20th century set up loud notes here, put a show on Mayakovski’s texts, conducted literary works, and rewrote with Lenin’s wife.
The census continued for four years, and as reported in 1939 by the newspaper Yuna Stalinec, with every day “the friendship between Hope of Constantine’s Crusades and the friends of the Children’s Library of Barnaul” became ever stronger.
Hope Konstantinovna even once sent her childish photograph to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnaul asked if Hope Constantine objected to assigning her name to the library, she wrote that she did not object.
Writings have long been found in the museum, and the grandchildren and grandchildren of first - century readers have had to explain how this harsh profile decorates the library’s barrel.
In the years that reform was often called, people were upset: Why is the children’s library not renamed?
Let the library be the names of some good child writer, without a political charm!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything.
"Krupski" is, of course, the most famous and popular library in Barnaul, like "Leninska" in Moscow.
On the platform in the librarian vestibule is a road from a yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Immortal City" is the favorite theme of the artist Olli Moskovka.
Previously, Ola was a manager in a legal company, worked at 8:00, left at 5:00, and all the other managers were distinguished only by love of painting.
And then she found an online announcement, "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called My Cancer Mommy, my mom's cancer.
Oil was making illustrations, and thought that life could end at any time, and there would be no miracles in it if you didn't create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, pictures the children’s books of writers all over the world, and makes her own stories.
Traditionally, children are losing interest in the book, that they live more and more in some virtual space...
But we've got kids reading, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says Tatian Cushvid, director of the Russian Planet.
In recent years we've even had such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and she's gonna live - kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
The library has a large exhibition with an updated photo exhibition.
Once in the neighborhood, new pictures of readers are posted in the library of the whole family — Mom, Dad, and children.
The library is happy that the popes have become more and more popular with the children.
If a child has been read all over Chukovsky in two years, he needs books that are more complicated at an older age.
But now there is a law prohibiting an eight-year-old child from issuing books from category 12+.
To obtain such a book, the child must bring the parents with him, they come back, then they return, and gradually the "Krupski" becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - the pre-revolutionary collection of the Ayahs and the eras, to take the Queen in the annex to the magazine "News", the postwar "Murzilki" in 1936.
Now we're not just the conceptual space of the temple of the book, we're now open for movement, we're trying to become a special place: not a house, not a work, not a school, - explains Tatian Cushvid.
We can come together to read, play, draw.
We've made a play area for the little one - the child just comes to play, and the hand is still sticking to the book!
Some of our readers are carrying their parents, and they are holding their feet, not wanting to leave.
Mothers often come with wheels - and we are glad that they put the library first among all the other places where they have to come with the little ones.
Tatiana Cushvid says: Modern children like us once loved classical children's literature:
“The publishing business is developing now, and much attention is paid to the authors who are intergenerational linkages.”
And when it comes to little children, it's important for them to be some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The Library regularly publishes booklets for parents, telling what is happening in modern children’s literature, which books are worth paying attention to, and why.
The booklets are so attractive and interesting that adults are interested, but they are still not interested in this library.
It is forbidden to produce books outside the reading room for adults.
This magical privilege is only for children.
...The library's next room has a square arch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the library.
The steps will slip under your steps, it's a very old time machine.
You meet with the book of your childhood, like an old friend: Hi, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie's still walking along the road, driven by a yellow brick, Tol Rizicov's tape is tricking magic spears, and Malchis Kibalchis didn't say that to the cursed Burgundy of the Military Secret, that's what he's got.
Books like passwords, they can be found anywhere.
There are books in the warehouse and the present rares - for example, the pre-revolutionary collection was with the Ayahs and the eras.
Or take the Queen in a famous annex to the New magazine.
Or a "Murzilki" in 1936.
Time passed, and the pages were decorated in a tea color.
These publications are no longer published to readers.
It's a picture of our future collection, and I'm all dreaming about retirement, and I'm going to take care of rare children's books.
But the kids don't do it, so to speak. And the beauty in the old books isn't very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the Commodore.
Now it seems, why did we all write this "Pioneering Truth"?
But it was still interesting, says Galina Ilasov, a bookstore.
The Murzillki pages have faded from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna will lead the bookstore all her life.
She knows what the color of Buratino's traps is, how in the academic year Harry Potter became the captain of Griffindor's team at the Quiddice Championship, what situations Karlson uses the silencer for the motorbike, and who works for Alice Selesney's father.
The librarians pay little for the work, and everyone who can live without these books is quick to find another profession.
Only the most convinced are the educators, the educators, the ministers of the cult of books.
They can also be found in a smile, which is thought to be a professional picture of a children’s library.
If he smiles at you at the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I like children's books at all: how the librarian likes them to be fair and beautiful on the shelves, and I still love reading them, says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical behavior, stories, fantasy.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating of all that was happening to me at that time.
And since I loved them foolishly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be despite the riders.
And I'm glad that our ex-readers bring children and grandchildren...
Headphone: There's no difference in Celtic.
Griffiths has rejected the discussion of the Seltic disagreements after Dayla admitted that "Hupps" was in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nelson, and Worberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that might violate the team's unity.
"Dons" increased the advantage of "Seltic" to five points
The Penalties of Adam Runi in the first time gave Aberdeen a little advantage over Hamilton in Pittodri, allowing Dons to get rid of Seltika at five points.
Griffiths rejected the debate on disputes
This caused rumors of disagreements in Celtic, which were cut off by Griffiths, who said that he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism, preparing to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling tension, I think the players are looking for him.
The Dutch are bored because the Scottish are not fighting for the title - de Bur
Former Rangers semi-protector and former Dutch collector Ronald de Bur said that the Dutch football players lost interest in Seltica because he didn't compete for the title of Rangers.
De Bur, currently a representative of Ajaxa, said: "In the Netherlands, the most attractive points of the Celtic game are no longer shown, and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
In the Old Company games, there's a lot of tension, and not just people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was experiencing difficulties, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
After the defeat of Malme and as a result of leaving the Champions League, you soon lost 10 Aberdina footballers, who are now on the top of the table after five points.
However, Dale said, "The Selita had bad times and before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand it's very boring, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's happening.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really really need Seltica's support, because it's getting a lot better.
Stay together now so important.
Worberton is looking forward to January transfers
Despite the views expressed just a few weeks ago that he had identified some of the goals of the January transfers, the Rangers boss Mark Worberton was suspicious of the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the team's unity.
The former attacker, Brentford, said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
With regard to the players coming in in the summer, you have a period before the season starts to adapt, which you have seen in our own group in the season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary games to what you really need.
Mitchuk, who is interested in Celtic, suggested that the career be completed
The attacker "Suncy" Mitch, connected to "Seltic" during the transfer window, suggested that he could leave the football after his contract with "Lebeds" ended.
The 29-year-old game was in trouble with the boxing for two years, and he couldn't leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to resist the SFA on Nelson's statements.
"Harts" says with account 2:1, when Patterson was removed, and they started to lose 3:2, but the red card of the defendant was canceled later; this is the third red card of Colum, cancelled in eight months.
Nelson doesn't give up his words saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tinkasl
The direct play of the Haibernian team was excused after admitting that he sang a song with insulting words about the former Harts player Rudy Skacell.
The incident occurred in the pub in Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh Derby in Tinkasle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was a fireman," the attacker said, adding, "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going back to Tinkasl if he wasn't playing for "Seltic."
Donnelly: Tannadis Board of Directors "Dandy United"
Simon Donnelly argues that the Board of Directors of Dandi United is still confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration in the situation in the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys out again," said Donnelly.
Makinnes is glad he won the "nearly" at Hamilton.
Derek McKinness acknowledged that his team, Aberdeen, had been desperate to fight Hamilton Assisis, to win the seventh round in the lead of the League, which placed them at five points above Celtic, on the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runi's first-time penalty.
McInness said, "There's not a team here that would win anything like a doll or a league champion who didn't win a meeting like this."
There is no change in the unemployment rate among the Scottish people, while in the United Kingdom it is generally growing
Unemployment in Scotland remained at the level of 164,000 people between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher in the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the current number of workers being 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by a quarter to 74.0 per cent, above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
In commenting on the latest figures, Scottish Minister David Mandall noted: “The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
It has been almost a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the situation in Scotland ' s labour market in terms of employment growth and unemployment reduction.
Why am I a witness of the punishment in Oklahoma?
Today, as I avoid legal interference at a later stage, I will see the punishment of a man.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll sit on the visual gallery of the death row in Oklahoma State when Richard Glossip is punished with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As I got closer to that day, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique appeal.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the executions in America, and since those who want more than places often decide who will be chosen by the dark lottery.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats has been reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will watch it without any emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've had our own relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh often when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being impartial on Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes to get access.
I begged her.
She admitted that she could “make it better” herself, but she still felt that I was wrong about what I was doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with any of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that, even if he said it.
I told him he could get me out of his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the public will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, Huffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to the podcasts I wrote.
I'm not going to be here in detail again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treize make him guilty of a felony.
But I believe there's a great chance he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure that the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die.
I can't say I'm being completely objective.
Other reporters will also be available.
I'm gonna let you know what it's like to see someone I like die without need.
Persecuted police have arranged to leave the Canning River
The constebule from the town of Canning-Weil managed to get a man out of the Canning River and stay dry.
The resident of Perta was going to leave the police station, but he couldn't afford to stop in the dirty water at a lighthouse several metres from the police officer who was trying to get him off the beach.
The Canning Way police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by moving to Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, come on, catch me," said senior Sergeant Chandell Casldine.
Constable Laklan Perhavec didn't really want to urinate, so he used a safer reception -- "negotiation with good police."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says senior Sergeant Kasldain.
That's what Ben Casino's football champion remembers.
In 2006, Casino went to Kuwait to avoid meetings with a police patrol to check on alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts have been in vain, but locals have been moved to invent the funny "Ben Casino Biatlon".
Peter Mudi accuses the stewards of trying to spy and threatens to get out of horse sport
Peter Mudi accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to introduce a spy into his chariot last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His aim was to become the stewards and staff of the Racing Victoria Ethics Division, whom he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and to withdraw from the beginning of Lady Tathai because of violations of the rules of use of drugs on the day of the launch, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Mudi told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to jump, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive outcome of the Cobalt Leader test, which he could not explain.
He was speaking about the suspicions of espionage for half a year, and he didn't want it to look like a green vineyard.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it's so kicking you out of the wheel that you don't stop," Mudi said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to experience the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to get some sleep.
I want to walk with my head up high and I want my masters to know - I do everything I can for them.
When they start thinking it's not like that, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier Mudi sensibly said during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horse.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart sat in a room with a man I'd call, if they asked, and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I'm doing in my stable," Moody told Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, all of them should, of course, make statements because they did not try to catch me.
Robert Rollston, former President of RVL, David Mudi, current President of RVL, and Bernard Sandra, former CEO of RVL, knew about this all the time and now know it.
Shouldn't that make me think it's getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL take courage and call for a response to what is happening in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it's true.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But now I've come to the point where I don't care, and I'm sorry.
I'm sad about this.
I will put pressure on them and entrust them with the responsibility for taking a decision.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's boredom has only grown in a long investigation into the cobalt and the leader's case, and the latest withdrawal of the horse from the start has made him claim that he can "get his license on the table".
Mudi, most famous for preparing the invincible Black Caviar champion, called for the use of medical remedies on the day of the “laughing” competition after the horse’s legs were pressed out of the clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the jump rules.
"I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my fault-finding workers made her a leg.
She could've gotten a compression last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the run.
Mudi may be disqualified for three months in accordance with the rules on the use of medicinal products on the day of the competition for the use of the compress, for which the Stuarts have launched an investigation.
It's the anecdotes.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
A driver who is on his way and hiding from the scene in Kobrama, arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Kobrama and hid from the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital on a helicopter with serious injuries after being hit by a car at Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver had left without stopping to help the wounded motorcyclist.
On Monday, the 50-year-old resident of Natalie surrendered to the police in Sheppartone.
It is expected that it will be charged with leaving the place of the incident, neglect of assistance and violations of other road traffic rules.
A motorcyclist, 40-year-old Kobrama, stays in a hospital in a stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellami, is paring the accusations of rivals in the use of harsh force receptions.
Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellami called the criticism of his team's taking the ball as "the opening of the agenda" by two NRL champions.
Coach Sidney Rusters said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" his team during a sudden Storm victory at the end of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach Brisbane Broncos Wayne Bennett made a clear match at Storm after his team won the final qualifying tournament at Nosern Queensland Caboys on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the Regby League and said that two of Queensland's teams were not "too successful" in a handcuff.
Bellami was protecting the edge of the ball by his team and said they were just focused on "contacts", taking the ball.
Bellami added that he was convinced that his team had been criticised by two leading coaches, since that meant that they were concerned about the possible defeat of Storm.
"It's still floating - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about harsh receptions when they played us on account 24:2," Bellami said on Wednesday.
I can tell you that we haven't changed anything all year round in our defense systems or techniques, just in the last six weeks, we've been paying special attention to the contacts when the ball is caught, and this has become a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years and he's been obviously training an excellent team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always turns out at this time of year.
Bellami questioned the idea of Bennett's impressive football, reminding his teacher that Saint George's Illavar Dregons had won the 2010 championship, showing the "weary" football.
Wayne's talking about a catchy football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday evening with ours on Friday evening, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellami remarked.
I remember that in 2010 Saint George was a lot of criticism, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said it wouldn't matter.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young semi-protectors at their speed.
It's a football that you'd like to play when you have these games.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two semi-protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play.
It gives me more confidence because they're saying these things because they're a little worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when they got to big games.
Bellami also noted that Storm and Rusters were competing with a large number of points than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the bill? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is this impressive football?
Or consider the break and the failed attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, that means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storms at the end of this weekend, as they won the right to host North Queensland Cowboys or Crown Sharks on Saturday evening at the AAMI Park pre-final, tickets will be sold the next Tuesday morning.
Serbian drug-indicted release of $20,000 in pledge
A man who was threatened with a life sentence for attempting to allocate 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland was put out for $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht from South America through Vanuatu and in Kumer in August.
During the morning Maximovich and his associates saw them at the dock, and later he met them at the Coomer Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximović's life was threatened by an attempt to allocate sufficient drugs for sale, his lawyer, Maximović, claimed that there was no evidence that he had tried to obtain the entire party, and that the man could have been in coffee without any intention.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flenagan, doubted that Maximovich should have been released.
The latter has relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
The mother and uncle of Maximovich were invited to make a joint bet of $200,000 for his release.
"The testimony of both shows that the amount of $200,000 is too high a financial burden for them," said Judge Flenagan.
But one of these measures was not enough as a guarantee that it would not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovicu was allowed to be released under bet provided that he would deliver both his Australian and Serbian passport, be reported to the police on a daily basis and comply with the commandant from 6 o'clock in the evening to 6 o'clock in the morning.
Fotis Kacikaris: "I am proud of the gathering of Greece, which has been fighting until the last few seconds."
Greece's main coach, Fotis Kacikaris, paid tribute to his team after match 1/4 Eurobasket 2015 final with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the games was solved by certain mistakes.
It was a big game, quote AFP Kacicarisa.
We're ready for a great game in Spanish.
They tried to work in defense, but mistakes in the defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought up to the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I will be assigned to the CSCA to the functions of the Coun."
CSCA Newsman Joel Freeland said he doesn't believe in the army curse.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break down the negative trend and finally win the Euroligo next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and myself, after I joined the team, quote "R-Sport" Friland.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to move to the central position, but at the NBA, I've been playing forwards.
Now you're gonna have to fight a big central rival more, but I've done this before, so I think, and I'm gonna do it now.
The Armenians won the Euroligo last time in 2008.
Since then, they've been on their way six times to the "Finally Four", but they couldn't always show their best basketball.
It's the opinion that the team was wrong.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's difficult, I understand all the disappointments of the club and its patients.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance of winning Euroligo, I really think so.
Always wanted to win this title, the Moscows had already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSCA.
As for the agreement, I am not a sovereign man and I do not believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any rituals, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "For me, a match with "Rome" will be special."
The main coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first round of the team tournament of the League of Champions with Rome with special feelings.
According to the teacher, the apparent unity of his current and former team would be far from complete.
Remember that Louis Enrique trained wolves in the 2011/12 season, but couldn't show up on the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, after which I had gained some experience.
I have only very warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the League of Champions from victory.
The August meeting in Cuba, Joan Hamper, does not affect the action of the teams in the nearest match.
I'm looking forward to the "Rome" game she showed in series A against "Juventus".
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Wadim Scripchenko: "Krasnodar" has various options for attacking."
The Acting Chief Coach Ural Wadim Scripchenko in the pre-war of the 9th Tour of the League with Krasnodar noted the diversity of the opponent's team attackers.
According to the teacher, the bullies in their arsenal have several game models in attack.
The meeting will be held on 21 September and will begin at 16.30 a.m. in Moscow.
As we play with Crasnodar, let's see, the official website of the Urala word Scripchenko.
We've got a whole week ahead of us.
This team has a variety of options for attacking, variously carrying out its attacks, while we are not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the foreplay of this game, given that Krasnodar is leading the League of Europe's match against Dortmund's Borussia, we are very well prepared to win.
Roger Cannes: "The House of Astana" can pick a spot for anyone."
Astana's semi-protector, Roger Kanías, after the 1st round of the League of Champions with Benfia (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
Hubbek believes that in his field, the astronauts are able to pick points from any rival.
Although the match has been hard for us, I can say that we have played well, the official website of the UEFA leads to the words of Kanyas.
"Benfica" is higher than the class, but in a home match, I think we can count on them to pick eyes.
That's real.
But first you have to think about the Galatasarae and then the Atletics.
In home games, we can pick points for anyone.
Rafael Benitis: "I repeat as many times as I please: Christian Ronald is the best in the world."
The main coach, Reala, Raphael Benitis, expressed satisfaction with the great victory in the first round of the League of Champions League (4:0).
A specialist paid tribute to Christian Ronald, who became the author of three heads.
The match was not easy, because Schachter was able to control the ball, the UEFA's official website was based on the words of Benitez.
The opponent didn't have much time, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not gonna say Real played perfect, but we had enough goal options.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and kill four.
Christian Ronald confirmed his level.
It's the best game in the world, I'll repeat it every time.
Jordi Alba: "Christian Ronald can't compare to the Messiah."
The defender of Barcelona, Jordi Alba, believes that no one will be able to compare with his associate Lionel Messie.
According to Spanish, the Forvard "Reala" to Christian Ronald can't do it either.
Messies on five heads above the others, quote Le Figaro Alba.
Even Christian Ronald.
I can't compare it to anyone.
Danielle De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style, but also a bright individuality.
Half protector of Rome Daniel De Rossi before the match of the League of Champions League with Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and insurrection in the game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 a.m. in Moscow.
Remember, the SE will broadcast its text.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team of great players, and is quoting the official website of the UEFA De Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue-grannets, because they have not only a unique style, but also a bright personality.
To leave them, we're going to have to smell them all the time and insure each other.
Missions are almost always successful when they go under siege, so we need to remain compact and organized.
Ežov hopes to join the SKA in the match with Slovan.
GOLCYPER SKA Ilia Ežov stressed that he was hoping to join the army in the next match of the KHL champion.
Ežov went on ice instead of Mikko Koskinen at the 23rd minute at 0:3 and reflected all the drills on his doors, the fourth score of the SCA missed after replacing the door with the sixth field game.
The next team will be marching against Slovana.
I hope I get out in the next match in the starting line, "R-Sport" brings the word of Yahweh.
I'm not an expert on doors, I'm a doorman, we don't have the missing heads again, so it's hard to track.
"Dina" played well, everyone had bad matches.
The team still lost.
I'd better miss a bigger one, but the team won.

Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to get paedophiles to send pictures
Paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to question images of violence against children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet service, where he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a missing phone and found it in Hogg's sleep.
She checked it out and found shocking photos, and then immediately drew her mother’s attention to it.
The police came and saw five images, then examined the computers found at the address, and found “appropriate” requests in the search system using words to detect child imagery.
Hogg then told the police that he did this because it could "draw the pedophiles" and then he would " pretend to be a cop to scare them."
Commissioner for Justice Elid Robertson told the Sheriff's Court in Danda: "He said it was a passion, he was a fear of people.
He admitted to making requests on his computer, but he said it was because he wanted to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown man who had sent him images and asked him to send more pictures.
He said he was doing this to lure them.
He said he had a headache when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother and cried.
She had seen unwholesome images on the phone, and then an eye rate was made with the accused.
The girl was interrogated and reported that the accused had used the computer and Playstein to talk to the girls who looked much younger.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dandi, admitted to guilty of charges against children's ill-images last June 14, in violation of the conditions of the siege on 25 January, and did not appear before the court on 24 March this year.
The lawyer, Gregor Sim, applied not to include Hogg in the list of persons who committed sexual offences, as it can be proved that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmikel postponed the sentence until October, pending the receipt of reports from the social services.
Hogg was released under a bet on the case, but he was detained before hearings on other cases.
It was listed as having committed sexual offences before the date of conviction.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe is not reading that speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the senior head of State in Africa, fell off the platform earlier this year.
He didn't get hurt, but the video with the fall scene was immediately spread over social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also obscured by statements by opposition parliamentarians that they had received anonymous threats warning them of the siege of Mugabe in the course of the treatment.
A month ago, they saw the President at his address to a nation in Parliament, which is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of the Parliament of the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonez, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt Mugabe.
“The message came from a number that is not reflected, but it is entitled “Death”, he told journalists after the end of the Mugabe speech.
The noted members of Parliament warned that the integrity of the Parliament was terminated in the building, and as soon as they left, the parliamentary integrity of the House did not work.
A member of Parliament said that the party led by Morgan Zwangari was "anxious" with threats to its policies.
Hewlett Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce from 25 000 to 30,000 jobs under its programme of restructuring and reducing service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two companies registered on the company's stock exchange, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster development of the hardware and service sectors.
The estimated reduction in jobs would amount to approximately US$ 2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, is stated in Hewlett-Packard.
"This restructuring will ensure a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Mae Whitman, President and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett Packard currently, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper to help the company move to a new business style," Witman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have over $50 billion a year and “will focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technology solutions” to companies, says the company.
This is how the company, which was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of the Stanford University of Bill Hulett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment, was called the Palo Alto garage “the birthplace of the Crimean Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of extensive reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This HP, the second world manufacturer of personal computers and one of the largest U.S. technical companies, is the latest development in this sector, based on confidence that the specialized companies are working better.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dinam Zagreb.
In his conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that only September, and that if Wilshire's recovery is planned, nothing will prevent him from returning to Christmas.
In the most favourable development of Wilshire events, at least four of the following games will be missed in England and, in view of what has happened, its participation in the European Championship will remain a question next summer.
The worst thing about this recent problem was that Wilshire had definitely ended the previous season with the only trauma of the blade and was going back to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This trauma does not endanger his career."
It's just not the bone that's still alive.
Nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
This is not related to the joints or injuries he has previously suffered.
This may be medically related, but as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries in six years from his debut.
He also played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal schedule wider, you can see that at six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two premier league clubs, which account for most of the days that have passed due to the trauma.
Wenger recognizes the likelihood of a riot, but Arsenal believes that improvements in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes after the injury, you've been vulnerable for some time -- for that time you need to restore strength and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough and he'll be fine.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure he'll have a career that he deserves.
The Arsenal launches a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dinom Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and the next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur and Wenger to complete the composition.
Actor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so Mother Debushi and Arteta would probably play in the first place.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kiran Gibbs and Olive Giru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Wolcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little bit of an advance to those games that need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in Group F, the Maximir stadium in Zagreb is among the most striking in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost any of the 41 players since they were able to spend the last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by a 3.2-ball earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is convinced that Arsenal took the lesson he had learned last season when the team suffered defeat in the League of Champions of Monaco and remained weak in hope of bringing the club to victory at the Cup of Champions.
"This is an incredible drive," said Wenger.
Arsenal's never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I was an intern.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons about a man's friendship
The absence of such stories is being overlooked, especially if it is to take into account how desperate the need for men to be frank is now more than ever, while the level of suicide among young men is up to 15 years of age.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of men ' s death between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and will happen to men three times more often than to women.
In an attempt to address the problem of the Campaign against Unhappiness in 2015, the Year of Men announced that it is a year of challenge to a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
The society is at the heart of this battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 students at universities with symptoms of depression found that if the patient had enough friends “in the normal mood”, the chances of healing were doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends doubles the chance of mental disorders.
But of course, to have a friendship work first and foremost, it must be.
In a time when communication is managed by social networks, when the style prefers content, the speed of response is often more appreciated than content contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to be strong, loving, and successful, even if loneliness is real.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status -- all through internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire recently noted, the video gamer, you're not buying any more luck for money.
The honor of Friends is that they draw this attention.
Each person was determined not by his own work but, rather, by the personality that was manifested in association with his friends.
Jumor Joey and Chandler's constant coverage, moments of soccer viewing on comfortable chairs, Ross's breath on Rachel, all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full study of their feelings.
As the Samaritan officer told me: "...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, stresses how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit."
The men who approach us often feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old teaching “live with it” is as strong as the feeling that an open discussion of problems can be perceived as weakness.”
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term mechanisms of overcoming.
It stressed the few moments of a man’s friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the status of the remote telephone speaker has helped people in times of despair, while long-term support has come from close family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central in these outlets, where the holiday has completely restored decorations, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or even better, if you see a single person in Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."
Don’t think about the benefits that friendship can bring.
Series Friends show Comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, on the tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria kills the target by helping the PSJ to break the Malmé.
The Angel of Mary is like Black Matthewy and Edison Cavani celebrating the dead balls at the gate of Malmö.
Angel di Maria, debuting at the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed the PSJ to easily round the Malme on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the game response.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Kavani did their job when Pari Saint-German started his game at the Champions League with a very convenient victory of 2:0 against Malma at the Park de Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria killed the ball less than four minutes after he started his first game at the League of Champions as a P.S.P.S. player, but they missed out on a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored at the 61st minute.
In addition to the Real Madrid and the Indonesian Chesser in Group A, the Pari had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, because they were not aimed at qualifying the playoffs, but at continuing the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned their eyes, but at the same time it was not the best decision of Laurent Blan to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in the attack and later to replace him in the field against the team from his hometown and the club in which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win a house or a guest in the Champions League, so to win a 2:0 win, to deliver problems to our opponents and play a great defense, it's a good start, even if there are other moments we'll need to finish during the season," said Blanc.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, even though I'm sorry we didn't kill one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after the trauma in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her nothing with account 2:2 in a match with Bordo in the First League in the outbounds, but he took him back to De Maria's background at the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was noted as a player capable of taking out the PSG to a new level in Europe, after being redeemed last month at Manchester United, and he proved why, when he escaped from Marco Verratti behind the protection of Malma, he made a beautiful end of the attack by sending a sword past Johan Willand to a remote corner of the gate.
However, if anyone expected a slight and great victory from the GSP, they had to be disappointed.
Malmey, who beat Seltic in the playoff to reach this stage, was a major opponent of the nine world-level players in the field at the start of the game, the five defenders and two resistance semi-protectors in the middle of the field.
But with the exception of the hit by Nikola George, where the ball flew past the further pole of Kevin Trappa's door at 34 minutes, they attacked quite a bit.
That is why, at times, the PSC was fooled by inconspicuous transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who was unable to do at least five attempts in the first half of the game, and then was unable to handle the ball Kavani killed immediately after the game was resumed.
Nevertheless, he proved himself much more skilled in accurate passports, and it was a passport from Ibrahimovich, who received that, Di Maria sent a ball with a curved punch, which went through a tap at the booth beyond Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally killed after an hour's notice thanks to Kavani, the Uruguayan man killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic scored the ball sent to the center of the field with the left flag Maxwell.
This put an end to any idea that had been at Malma's regarding the return to the game, and only the capture of the ball by Viland from a close distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final account before his successor, Ezekiel Lavess, was counted naked at the end of the match.
Coach Malme Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was the top of his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game at the League of Champions was held last December."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish League, and that's not the level.
There's not enough qualifications.
Praise "Pearl"!
It was a great match with them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion for sale of shares

The White House confirms the visit of C. Jinpina to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that China's head would be visiting the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, the first visit to C.C.in Washington, will take place on 25 September and will be a return visit to Beijing last November, says the statement.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michel Obama, will also receive C. Zinpin and his wife, Pen Liuan, at the government lunch the same night after the two leaders have bilateral negotiations.
“The visit of President C. Zinpina will provide an opportunity to enhance cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as will enable the Presidents of the United States and China to address controversial issues constructively,” the Communication states.

The winner of the biker at the Kutuzovski was given 2 years of colony.
In addition, the court partially met the civil claims of the victims of Dani Mirzoev of 1.2 million rubles.
The Dorogomilov Court of Moscow sentenced Danny Mirzoev to death by killing a motorcyclist on the Kutuzov Prospekt in Moscow.
As reported by the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years ' imprisonment in the settlement colony.
It is found guilty under article “Refoulement of road traffic rules and operation of vehicles” of the UC RF.
In addition, the court partially met civil claims of 1.2 million rubles.
During the discussion of the parties, the prosecutor requested Mirzoev to be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and to receive eight million rubles from the victim.
The accident on 22 May occurred about three hours a night in the area of the house 30 on the Kutuzov Prospekt.
The BMW car, followed by Mirzoev, crossed the traffic line and hit a motorcyclist on the sidewalk.
From the trauma received in 1989, the man of birth ended up on the ground.
The friends of the deceased in the social networks reported that the BMW driver was driving at a high speed and headed to the meeting area before the DTP.
Fearing that the driver was trying to get away from responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle ride from the Orobje Mountains to the GUMVD Moscow building in Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it was known that the investigation had detained the alleged culprit of the DTP.
A naked man was detained in Moscow.
He was calm and did not commit any wrong, and the police handed him over to doctors for urgent psychiatric care.
Staff members of the capital police arrested the inhabitants of Moscow, who entered one of the temples without clothing.
This is reported by the Moscow Agency.
The incident occurred on Tuesday, 15 September, about 4 p.m., on the Kashir Show, as reported by the head of the GVM Press Service in Moscow, Andrei Galiakberov.
A naked man entered the temple of St. Nicholas.
He was calm and did not commit any wrong.
At the scene of the call, the police arrived.
The law enforcement officers were expecting doctors from the immediate psychiatric care unit and handed over to them a man.
They were 26 years old in Moscow.
Over 40 decrees and orders were signed by Vladimir Jakusev.
More than 40 regulations and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen Region, Vladimir Yakusev, at the meeting of the presidency of the regional Government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and health institutions in municipal education.
In particular, funds for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Nijnetavdin area, for the capital renovation of the district hospital in the Kazan region.
As indicated in the accompanying documents, the money will be completed at the capital repair of the second floor of the therapeutic office.
There will be a renovation of hot and cold water supply, water supply, electrical networks and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, building façade, renovation of premises, and a complex of fire safety and energy conservation activities.
Soci will be the second forum for the regions of Russia and Belarus.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi on 17-18 September, with the participation of the Tunisian delegation in the head of the Governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of the cooperation are described by the Honourable General Consul of the Republic of Belarus in Tumena Vladimir Shugla, who has joined the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the goals of the Consensus Forum?
The large event in Sochi reflects the State ' s industrial policy.
It builds on fruitful cooperation between the regions, an important relationship between the two States.
It is planned that the plenary meeting will be attended by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko.
The plenary and sectional meetings will address the experiences of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policies, the rule of law and the programmes of the Federal State.
A forum will be held by the Governor of the Tumen Region.
I believe that this demonstrates the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of profile ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the region of Thumen, will be held.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new favourable contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, were involved.
At that time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and the Mining areas was signed.
The importance of our work is also indicated by the fact that the ongoing seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Russian Union and Belarus was held in Thumena.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tumen region was in the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of the Belarusians in training for agriculture, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agricultural sector.
You have recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with the Governor of the Tumeni Region, Vladimir Yakushewi spoke about the region ' s cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in the face of current challenges.
The issue of the supply of Belarus ' s agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms is that they are necessary to reduce the cost of machinery for the end user.
Problems were discussed in the work of the business house of Belshine and options to prevent losses.
Important issues, as investment projects should work well and bring benefits to the region.
Further supplies of OAO's passenger and freight equipment were referred to the development of the OAO's service centre "OAO" established in Tumena on the OAO's TPAT.
The discussion also drew attention to the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.
Another theme of the discussion was the conclusion of the agreement and the signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific and cultural cooperation between the Tumen Region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relationships promise to come to a new level.
The issues concerned the area centre.
During our meeting with the head of the administration of Tumeni, Alexander Moore, we talked about updating the Tumeni Bus Park.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on the floor", so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will operate on clean, clean gas.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator factory cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of the Mogilevliftmash elevators.
In my view, these activities could become more active, taking into account new lifts in the district centre.
In addition, the expanded consulate met with the Governor of the Kurgan Region, Alexei Kokorein, who discussed increasing freight traffic and supplying modern Belarusian technology in Zaurala.
A meeting with the male governor was scheduled at the end of September.
There are five RF entities in the expanded consular district, but Turkey can be called the district headquarters.
The region is a polygon for many future projects, including the work of the Honorable Genconsul.
In general, such meetings are important and good by enabling many problems to be addressed directly and quickly, by removing them and by developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
Under the current circumstances, it is vital not to destroy the fence by continuing to work on the prospect.
Matt Damon against emphasising the ethnic diversity of filmmakers
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effi Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnic composition should not be taken into account.
During the resurrection show Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, a well-known actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the project scenario.
"The diversity is appropriate when you're making a cast for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
The bright Brown, without believing his ears, cried out, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
To discuss the finalists of the show with Damon and Brown, Ben Afflek and Farelli ' s producer colleagues joined.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think about what the harmoni image they are going to hold on to," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white bra.
Dear White People's film producer said that Leo Angelos and Kristen Brankachcho were the directors of the film; Damon was strongly opposed to saying that "we can't get what we want in the end."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks exploded with unacceptable comments to Damon.
Twitter user Mr.Pooni was angry about the video show: "The explanation of the diversity of Matt Damon's only black person in the TACOE BELLOE room, which is painful."
Tweet got over 5,000 retwits and 4,000 likes.
Damon ' s statements were made at a time when the literacy of the racial theme in the media was the most pressing issue on the agenda of the public debate.
After a young man named Michael Brown was shot by the police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity throughout the country, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colored population.
In February, a singer, Prince, mentioned this movement during the nomination of applicants for the album of the year at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"Albums still matter," he said.
As books and lives of black people, albums still matter.
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement leaders issued an official statement in response to the Fox News staff question, Elizabeth Hasselbeck, on whether this group would be considered as a group of haters.
"The Network of Black Lives Matter is a group of love," said movement leaders.
It was recently announced that Damon had been included in the list of business, producer and media actors who had been invited to visit the Pope in Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
I don't know if the actor accepted an invitation and met Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" rewards the first champion
On Monday night, Officer Isaac Caldjero's professional scallop and assistant became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show, taking home a $1 million prize.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which had just ended, none of the participants had been able to pass all stages of the track with obstacles.
At the end of the season, two participants, Caldjero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a lift of 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to perform the task and was the first athlete in the history of the American Ninja Warrior, which was stage 4, but Caldjero was able to handle the task for three seconds faster than he had done as a winner.
After the victory that came with incredible work, Caldjero, who was shocked by what he won millions of dollars, gave the interview "E!News".
"To think about it is incredible, I have never earned or lived for more than $10,000 a year," he commented to the E journalist!
And secondly, I've never even imagined what the future might be like.
Executive producer Kent Wyd met with the Hollywood Reporter journalists to discuss the final and why Britten, who was the first to cross the track, won't get any cash prize.
According to the rules, money is received by the fastest participant.
"If the financiers are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," said Will.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life changes, it is still very satisfying.
I don't think he's offended about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He's got tons of freaked-out reviews.
He's a wonderful man and a family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff said to me, "If I was going to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we changed roles.

"Detrot Tigers" quietly walk "Minnesota Twins"
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers is now the last in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming only to be a mess, the Tigers won on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with a result of 5-4 at Target Field.
Twins missed the chance to cut back half the game from Houston Astros and take second place in the playoff by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroits, even one night, it was a return to the letter F, which spurred most of them to the second half of the season.
"All winnings are fun, no matter how they get," said the manager of the Tigers, Brad Osmus.
The Tigers Peter Alfred Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, which resulted in Detroit picking up three points in the first two innings, then adding another in the sixth and the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a painter in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start for nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
The painters can't be put in each game, so I want to get deeper into the game.
The appointed "Tigers" Victor Martines was able to take three blows and scored two shots -- the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He worked well by the bit," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (butter quality), much better in bit work and kept this quality for the game.
After three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance of getting back into the game.
The central host, Byron Baxton, opened an inning with a doll on the left-hand side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making a band, took the first base, and the second bassman Brian Dozer got a strike-out from Simon before he took his place on the left side of Blain Hardy.
Hardy passed Morera, the only player on the way, a newly appointed model Miguel Sano, who shot a two-way "single" left of Dr. Verhagen's right.
With a pair of earlyrs not in the car and a comparably wound on the second base of VerHagen, Trevor Pluff's third bassman was able to be shot in a double-play.
This was the 27th time for the leading league player in the season when Pluff shot the ball on the double.
After Detroit added an insurance wound to the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned RBI a "dub" in space between the outfilters against the closing painter "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the account became 5-4.
However, the right-hand player beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth saw.
Detroit took advantage of the temporary failure of Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a meritorious drinker, who was on the list of traumatized to the game itself, without more than a month in relation to the burnout.
"It's definitely not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as I developed the game, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to fill a few pretty good lunches in the third inning."
After the first butter reached its first base, Hughes left a single for the second lieutenant, Ian Kinsler.
Walker, at two J.D. Martines' car filter, took Victor Martines out, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martines finished his "0 for 21" series with the runners in an effective position.
The game of the third base of Nick Castelianos followed by a single one, but Victor Martines was beaten in an attempt to approach the third base, thus the threat was eliminated.
The Tigers have increased their second inning account by receiving a single-car "dub" from James McCann's casserole and a two-car "single" central to Antony Gouz, and it's become 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said manager Twins Paul Molitor.
He wasn't very good, but he fell right into the right place.
Hughes, whose wells were considered to have been thrown into the third inning without bearing points, was replaced by the right-hand reliefr A.J. Ahter.
Huzo had three wounds on six hits and a four-stroke hook.
NOTE: Pitcher-rechtsa "Tigers" Anibal Sanchez is out of the game due to the growth of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who was operating on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
For Sanchez, who has been on the list of traumas since mid-August, it is planned to start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez the left-hand painter Daniel Norris will leave the list of injured and will go out against Twins.
Norris, who came out of the Tigers in four early days from his acquisition in exchange for David Price's left drink on July 30th, has 1 victory and 1 defeat.
He did not participate in the games since 20 August due to muscle hair growth.
Tigers and Twins finish a three-game series on Targetfield on Wednesday.
against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play Ervin Santana's right painter (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint made by Kadiro in the book "Pray for God" was received by the South Sahalin Court.
In the South-Sahalin City Court, the original appeal was received by President Chechnya Ramzan Kadiro's representative for the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book "Pray to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam", says Interfax, referring to the President of the Gorsund of Alexander Chuhray.
The court is now awaiting possible objections to the proceedings.
Mr. Chuhrai refused to comment on the statements made by some of the MPs by Mr. RF on the need to check the forest for possible cooperation with foreign special services and IGIL.
"Shoot yourself to comment on such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the South-Sahalin City Prosecutor's Office appealed to Judge Natalie Perchenko for recognition of the book "Extremist Material".
The prosecutor's office in South Sahalinska filed an appeal on Friday night.
There are nouns: in the prosecutor's office they believe that they have requested the court to recognize only the extremist opinion of the author of the book, not the revelations of the Qur'an.
In the opinion of the prosecutor's office, the judge made an incorrect decision," said Chuhrai.
The decision to recognize the book “Extremist Material” was taken on 12 August 2015.
And indeed, the Qur'an has been cited as saying, "We worship you and ask you for help."
Kadiro called the decision-makers of the book "Satans and Provocators".
Members of the House called for a legislative ban on judicial decisions relating to the texts of the holy writings.
“I am firmly convinced that the House must adopt a law prohibiting judicial decisions relating directly to the texts of the Qur’an and other Divine Scriptures”, wrote Kadiro in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
The Facebook staff intend to remove posts and comments in which migrants and refugees are rated negatively.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints on the illegal content.
Fighting the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the Facebook guide is intended to work with the German Ministry of Justice.
Thus, Haiko Maas, former head of department, said that the past, together with the socialists, was currently working on the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to track and remove incorrect comments against migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, the authors of untenable posts are expected to receive notifications indicating the reason for their deletion.
It is also necessary to facilitate the prompt blocking of the illegal content by organizations that are trained to collect complaints from users about insulting posts.
The Facebook Manual is intended to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative expressions to migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was made after Xenophobia had grown sharply in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that took place some time ago in the EU.
Thus, in Germany today, all the items for the placement of refugees have already been filled.
Before the country ' s authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former conclave of Buchenwald.
Enforced internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks where the Nazi regime held prisoners and prisoners of war.
A relaxation zone will appear in Moscow’s caves.
In the near future, several capital digs are equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be the Boutow, Domodedow and the Sarbin Cave.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared in the Trookurov Cave in Moscow.
Such areas will continue to appear in other areas of the city.
M24.ru reported on this portal to Artem Ekimov, the head of the State Budget Institute for the Ritual.
Relaxation zones will represent small green areas that remind parks.
According to experts, in such “angles” visitors will be able to rest, stay alone and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, the area for relaxation will be built in the Domodedow, Boutov and Šerbin Caves and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the GBU Ritual chapter, where there is a need to expand the site, the builders will try to maintain existing forest masses as much as possible.
Green crops will serve as a live crop, which will divide the area of rest and land directly below the burial site.
The GBU's Ritual also stated their intention to submit a proposal for absolution of funerals.
The new caverns can truly be free of barriers.
In addition, the GBU Ritual described the readiness to set up electronic terminals to enable visitors to learn about GPS coordinates and numerous burial signs.
In June of this year, Ritaal was also invited to adjust the value of burial services, depending on the time of the year.
Yes, the burial site in summertime will be on a thousand rubles cheaply, during the winter weeks when the land is frozen.
We note that in the last year, the rates for all types of ritual services were on average 10 per cent.
Five days later, in the woods of Athens, a stray mushroom was found.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.
The discovery of the mountain miner has been achieved through the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambow area spent five days in the forest."
No food and no water.
He was searched for by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dog cinematologists, but there was no result.
The man was found after the helicopter was connected to the search.
On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovich usually went to the woods behind bars and bars, but he didn't come back to dinner.
The family immediately sought help, and the next day, rescuers and displaced persons from the neighboring village, about 30 people, were picked up to search for the mushroom.
On the fifth day, they were joined by a fire-fighting centre helicopter.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team at the fire and rescue centre of Smolens, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He's gone a long way, right elsewhere.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He spent a lot of time in his old age.
It's a miracle he's still alive.
Gribnica was delivered to the Greek central district hospital without knowledge, in a very difficult condition.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia as well as with severe dehydration and cooling.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days in the forest, doctors do not really represent.
Valentina Nepsa, head of the Greek Central Bank's Therapeutic Office: "A patient survey, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Taking into account all his chronic diseases.
The condition of the patient improved in the morning, remained severe, but with positive dynamics.
A pensioner named Vitaly Aleksandrovich comes to Smolenšina every year from the Tambo region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had gone to collect mushrooms before, but he never got deeper into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of a found mushroom, said, "Les not far from the road, in principle not local."
For a few years, he had been visiting relatives for a number of years.
Well, he went after the mushrooms.
Apparently, he went far and went astray.
At the beginning of the winter season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolen region.
Only in the last few days have there been five similar cases.
Rescuers remind us that in the woods we have to walk in bright clothes, with little food, snacks and compasses.
In addition, it is desirable to leave the traces behind so that they can be returned.
An accident on average in a brother's taiga.
Right on the average village in Siberia, an accident of An-2.
An emergency landing of the Red Sea carrier Enisei took place within 68 kilometres of Bratska.
There are no casualties or casualties, but the plane itself has suffered significant damage on land.
An-2 made an official trip.
There were three crew members on board, the commander, the second pilot and the boat mechanic, reports Interfax.
The accident took place on the Railway-Ilimsk-Achinsk route, which is based on the airline.
Flight crew's already delivered to Bratsk.
Following the crash landing of An-2, the British Transportation Prosecutor ' s Office began to verify compliance with flight safety legislation.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office left the scene.
In September 2010, Tu-154 crew landed their aircraft with passengers due to technical failure to land a heavy-duty airport in the Komi.
Engines and ship electronics were refused on the liner, but the crew made it impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in the emergency landing.
News Economics – Nobel laureate: globalization
The printing of globalization processes should have contributed to the reduction of world inequality.
In the case of the situation, the difference in the income of the population in developing economies, on the other hand, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers that is considered by the Chief Scientific Officer of the International Laboratory for the Analysis and Selection of Decisions of NIW, the Nobel Prize Prize for Economics of 2007 by Eric Maskin.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more and more open.
Globalization partners have predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," says Maskin.
For example, China and India have had a significant growth in GDP per capita.
But it's not that happy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between “poor” and “poor” in poor countries, which showed a high income inequality and more precise wage.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why global markets did not reduce inequality in developing economies,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by NUE VSE.
Together with the economist, Professor of Harvard University Michael Kremer Erik Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalization increases, the NIW recalls.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, the Machine allocates four levels of professional qualifications - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, poor country D professionals lack sufficient qualifications to cooperate with A and B professionals from rich countries.
And if level C workers from poor countries are growing in wages by cooperating with the B staff from the rich, the D staff do not feel or fall in wages.
The result is that the internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, to an increase in inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a wonderfully beautiful model, an alternative to the RICARDIAN theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor of the International Laboratory for the Analysis and Choice of Decisions, head of the Department of Mathematics of NYU.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it'll lead to the expansion of empirical work in this area.
The problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, employees themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the funds to pay for their training.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds could play a significant role, considered by the Maskin.
The scholar notes that the theory developed does not in any case call for a halt to the globalization process, which has produced and produced its fruits in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Derbent: live time.

But in the anniversary premonition, they are more and more recalling episodes of the unique history of their city, affecting the fate of the entire Black Sea region.
Domoded had a business game at the airport.
The capital has a new form of education.
Four hundred students have tried themselves as airport staff.
For this purpose, three aircraft models were installed in Domoded.
Young people not only watched and registered passengers but also served aircraft.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it has hardly become a reality.
The late voyages, immediately two passengers with breakovers on board, lost the trap somewhere along the way to the plane.
For this airport, hell.
For those who were founded in Angara Domodedova, a standard set of tasks is to be solved by the new arrivals.
Three large airports from different countries of the world were immediately included in one Angola.
Today, there are four hundred students from the capital colleges and colleges.
It is an unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the internal peace of the aircraft.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, luggage traffic were entrusted to them even by buses in the summer field, stairs, and passenger inspection.
And passengers are in trouble.
In one mess with the documents, the other delayed the journey, the third filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And we need to deal with all of this as in life, at a minimum.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual cash, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amounts for the travel service.
"For failing to perform these tasks, a fine is sought," explains Dmitry Hilko, a financial analyst in the Moscow News programme.
Officials from the Ministry of Education have been closely monitored.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of education.
It has already taken place in the course of secondary vocational education.
“There will be six interregional centres of competence, which will in fact become new models of modern colleges with modern management, with high-skilled staff, with modern equipment,” says the Director of the Department of Public Policy in the field of training and additional vocational education of Russian Minobrnoukya Natalya Zolotarev.
So students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need an exit.
Therefore, the evaluations for this examination had a full logistic expression.

The United States Embassy regrets the closure of the United States Centre in Moscow.
The US Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the American Centre ' s foreign literature library.
The centre worked in Moscow for over 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian Government's unilateral decision to close the U.S. Embassy Centre at the All-Russian State Library M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by the RF in recent years raise questions about the commitment of the Russian Government to relations between Russian and American peoples, which have not even been interrupted during the cold war and at other difficult times of our country's long history,” says Ambassador John Teftt of the United States, from Interfax.
The United States Centre has established deep and strong ties between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
He was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a venue for meetings with many American prominent actors, including cosmonauts, artists, sportsmen, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Last year alone, the American Centre conducted more than 400 cultural and educational activities and adopted more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” stressed the diplomat.
Teftt recalled that a decision had been made about a year ago to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was quick to take action.
Typical situation: Four officers are standing at the table of Judge Swatanter Kumar, hearing his claim for work done.
The court is not entirely satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to comfort you, says Kumar.
If there's one more piece left, we'll order all the existing buildings to be removed.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to prevent the rapid pollution of the environment, which has led to the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this period, the Tribunal has been able to consider more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, waste collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two or three cases, the court decides to terminate the construction leading to pollution.
Incredibly high rates: in the last 60 years since the declaration of independence of increased industrial development, India has become a virgin jungle country in one of the most populated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapolises, where infrastructure development is not conducive to rapid urbanization: the city is covered with plenty of power, the rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and the few remaining residential masses are cut off by new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support for the green movement by the State, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main cause of the cancellation of major investment projects.
Thus, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment referred to the court as “extreme” and “implementable”.
Sometimes the court ' s decisions are not really possible within the time limit set by the court, the environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani affirms.
However, incompatibilities also have a positive side: at least they force responsible persons to move.
"His main goal is to disrupt this system," added the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly abolished large structures: on its account the construction of the airport, electricity stations and hundreds of smaller buildings.
However, people also try not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which pollutes the local river with the ftoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People are losing their jobs," said Kumar.
However, such explanations are far from always understood by ordinary people whose lives can be changed by a single crack of the court.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles from entering the capital for more than 10 years than was the case for the public.
Despite the widespread popularity and criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to revoke the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of the Deli statistics on incoming and outgoing car transport, and offered to buy 10,000 additional buses, in advance, to know whether they were capable of carrying out such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to appear in the court ' s attention, the people ' s anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic of the principle judge was the Gang River Cleanup program, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganga, a sacred river for the Indus, the judge often ceases to hold his emotions and to cry.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water out of Ganga into the statue of God, and there were faeces in it, and the judge was burning.
You continue to pollute the river because you think that Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The cleanup of Ganga is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new Government.
The number of faecal bacteria in the river is now more than 120 times higher.
Each year between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million Hindus are dying of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganga Rescue Fund from selling his costume, where he met Barack Obama and 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists here accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was purchased for $700 thousand, while cleaning the river required at least $8 billion.
The Green Tribunal parties agree that India will have to go a long way before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress should be an environmental one.
“In the developing country, environmental discussions are often perceived as an unacceptable highlight,” says Malik Bhanot, an activist from Zov Ganga.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle between the environment and development."
The man poured blood on several pictures of Dali on a show in Riga.
A visitor to the Latvian Union of Artists exhibition in Riga broke the window into the museum and exported the sculpture of El Salvador Dali "An Angel's Appearance".
The museum is now exhibiting the work of Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
The man of birth entered the sculpture hall at 14:20 in 1985.
He immediately carried out the wrong thing: he carved out the sculpture, broke the windows.
Then he began to move around the premises and covered several works of permanent exposure with blood.
Among them is the portrait of Myervaldis Police's Message.
According to the Latvian Union of Artists Igoria Dobacchin, referred to as Interfax, the wines were also exported.
Police and artistic experts are at the scene.
The latter determine the extent of the damage and damage.
A criminal case of hooliganism has been brought against men.
In the Latvian Union of Artists from 4 August to 27 September, the works of Picasso and Dali are presented at more than 200 original works of artists.

China calls for a more open economy for peace
The economy should be more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Si Zinpin said on Tuesday in addressing a group facing the task of managing reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing openness policies”, he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group on Comprehensive Intensification of Reform.
He said that the expansion of openness and deepening of reforms would add new impetus and vitality to the economy and provide new space for economic development.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including the regulation of market access for investors, the amendment of border controls, the promotion of public enterprises (SOEs) involving private capital and the revision of the population registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will gradually be decommissioned through test programmes.
This is an important step, as it will provide the market with a more significant role in the distribution of resources, the rule of law in business and the promotion of openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken control of the powers conferred on it by companies, thereby ensuring that companies themselves carry out their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to adopt new patterns of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
More areas would be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of the government ' s economic sectors.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign funding and provide them with better conditions”, said the statement.
It will also facilitate the submission of applications for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or Green Card, by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the delivery process itself.
The meeting also discussed the protection of the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Ketzan and Ministers Liu Yushan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
