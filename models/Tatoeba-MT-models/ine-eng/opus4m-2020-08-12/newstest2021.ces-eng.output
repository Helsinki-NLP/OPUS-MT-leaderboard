Novák helped Trabzonspora elsewhere, he hit Škoda too
Defendant Filip Novak helped the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspora to title the vice-master.
His team won 2:1 on the Kayserispor field and held the third Besiktas behind him.
The attacker Milan Škoda gave after the ice transition from Slavia the tenth branch for Rizespor, who saved himself, even though he was at 1:3 on the field of Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed the excellent productivity of the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63th minute, the Kayserispor golman just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from the corner set the ball on the net.
The home managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute set shot the victory on his side when he successfully finished the break four on one.
The damage at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce was balanced by salt to 1:1.
The Rizespor did not last long, but it did not have to hate him, because because of the results of the rivals, he remained three points above the descent zone.
The competition ends with the Sunday duel of the Master's Basaksehir on the Kasimpasy field.
Well hidden caves in the woods near New Bor were actually not inhabited
In the north of the Czech Republic in the foothills of the Lužic Mountains, not far from the Nova Boru in Českolipsk, in the forests leading the Countess road, several sandstone services are hidden.
Natural and artificially created.
And we're behind that human hand created.
The place is called Jeskyna near the desert.
In fact, there was never a deserter here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely a hiding place probably on the grain.
The cave is squeezed from the side to the rock guard and accessible by the steps of the mountain.
But until the last moment, it's practically invisible.
He'll betray her to the narrow steps leading to some kind of rock gallery from where she first enters the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human settlements, at the time of creation it could have been on the upper shelf, where wood is today, field.
"The fact that the facility has no window and no traditional hot spot clearly shows that no deserter could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podrožek of the Philosophy Faculty of Jan Evangelist Purkin in Ústí nad Labem.
A single-space facility has only a stone fence that is likely to serve as a storage facility.
"I see it as a chamber to store some foods or products from the field," says Kamil Podrožek.
There are visible traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
The cracking of the sandstone with a tip was for all the simple and fast dedication.
It was enough to use spasms and gradually break the sand.
Depending on the length of the trail after the tip and the method of pollination, the period of appearance of the cave can be defined in a frame.
According to history, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is sometimes a person sleeping there in these days.
If you approach the cave of the mountain from one of the forest roads and we will take you under the cave stream and the nearby gravel road, you will surely find the path down too.
And by the way from the forest, you must still take the nearby Havran rocks.
Kokoj Minarík is after a hard fall in Germany in an artificial sleep
"Philip's in the best hands now.
The Institute is set up in similar cases, and we have a happy part of the family in Hanover.
This makes it much easier for me to take care of Finland's daughter," the server quoted Jezdci.cz as saying of Minarík's wife Katja.
"Everyone's doing their best, Filip now needs time for reconvalescence.
It doesn't make any sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered a problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said a woman in her 50s.
In support of the financial support of the injured Minarík, he called on twitter and star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, which he compared the legend of Lester Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been selected on the Gofundme server.
The target is EUR 100 thousand (ECU 2.6 million).
Video decider took Sassuola's football players four goals, lost 0:2
Sassuola football players won four times in the match in Naples, but finally they had to calm down with the defeat 0:2.
None of their goals decided after consultation with the video about the attack.
According to the Italian media, this is a record failure of technology, so many of the actions VAR has never failed one team.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than a road radar and punished him as no other team.
New technology sells records," the newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport commented.
"The festival of unknown targets of Sassuola.
VAR has never been so hard on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Neapol caught the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, after half an hour of the game, but it seemed that Sassuolo had settled.
But the goal of Filip Djuricić was not recognized after the video decision-making because of the attack.
For the same reason, they didn't pay any more Djuricic's action and hit Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi.
On the contrary, the home team added another target.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, the most in history was
"Growth has brought about both a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend of more frequent loading on public stations, as well as an accelerated development in the registration of new e-auts," ČEZ Tomáš Chmelík, head of the clean technology department, said.
Other large players such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of Tesla’s electric cars, as well as Bill’s and Lidl’s supermarkets, are also reported on the market.
Operators of classic pump stations are again represented by MOL.
She doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our electricity network just after the flood," explained Jan Juskova, a spokesperson.
However, the editor of Dinik obtained data exclusively from all 216 electrical stations operated by the company ČEZ.
It follows that the drivers from the station took on average 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the journey of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we remember a small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The wooden bulk tanking then took place at a free rate.
If the motorists had already paid for the pickup, their typical loss was about 330 crowns.
Electromobility is pulling primarily in the capital.
In Prague there are all five of the most heavy profits of ČEZ, which will protect the whole of the country with its popularity.
Then there's Olomouc running between the regions.
On the other hand, the smallest interest is about remote stations in the border, such as in Bohumín or Prachatics, which often remain unused all day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars arrived.
In a comprehensive survey of Dinik "Czeši in motion", eight percent of readers said that they consider buying an electric car into the family.
But only a third of the respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their neighborhood.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's progress in protecting and curing the Czech landscape and addressing the climate crisis is insufficient, and the speakers have called for a more rational approach.
The events called The Last Drop were attended by representatives of major organisations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace or Green Party, as well as smaller local communities.
"We have here, for example, people who have been going against the expansion of the Tours down, people who are going against the extraction of the stork at Uherska Ostroch, people who are going against the construction of foolish suburbs," said Marik Wolf's organizers.
It stated that the main requirements of the protesting are the establishment of a plan for the retention of water in the region, the dramatic change in agricultural policy and the system of subsidies towards sustainable agriculture and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
"The government is supposed to protect people's interests, not impartial and devastating business," she said.
At the Maloslateral Square, a stop was placed with a petition calling for representatives of the Czech State to establish a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and restoration of Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with transparency with passwords such as "The End of the Deployment" or "The Less Coal, More Coals".
From South Moravia to Prague came Jan Škoda from the company For water for people who protested against the draft of the stork to Hodoninsk.
"It threatens the drinking water source for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that gardens represent the fifth most profitable source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned draft of the stork is only about 500 metres from the gardens and according to the judgements it is certain that the quality of the water will be compromised.
The so-called agro-ecological farmer came from the village of Valeč to Karlovarska Vojtěch Veselý.
He pointed out small lighthouses that are not profitable for profits and profits and supply the residents directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population normally, while the surface does not damage the shape of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died at the fall of the plane at the house in Germany
At the fall of the ultralight aircraft to the apartment in western Germany, three people died today, and two others were injured.
They reported on the local rescue files, according to which there are probably two crew members among the dead and one household resident.
The plane crashed on the roof of the building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The basement apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, then caught fire.
The Hassians have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy local firefighter Robert Mayboom reported that the two flight crew members were probably dead.
The third victim, according to the police, is the woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) magazine, with an appeal to mayor Wesel, wrote that it was the mother of a self-reliance whose two - year - old daughter was saved from the apartment with minor injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency landing was found, which served as a stop at the landing.
The police are based on the fact that they came from an aircraft crash.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine started from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
Rheinische Post reported that before the crash, the plane was hit by a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, recalling another witness, wrote that the plane crashed into the air before it hit the ground.

At the end of March, she had 4.6 million.
The owner is the Austrian group Erste Group Bank, which is the key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
Voyettes present three emergency levels against coronavir on Monday
"They will gradually be based on the power of community expansion at the level of the regions.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtich said in ČT.
It will be semafor, each region will be marked with green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavir.
The Minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual countries.
He admitted that only the Moravian region would have orange at the moment and that it would be close to Prague.
The map will also include individual measures for regional health centres, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to address this at the regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtich said.
Watermelon and Karolínka
When watermelon Jonás and mlinar's daughter Karolínk get stuck in them, they don't have the simplest thing.
Jonah in love with his father, poor waterman Hastbuch, Caroline has no idea that her dear Jonah is no man.
Even though there's a young Libor who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Caroline, from that waterfall.
What if he's gonna intrigue and lie?
Especially when he can prove that Caroline Jonah has rejected and favored him, a successful Libor.
Soon it is clear in everything who can drown the midnight Convict, infected with flour, a fire of flour and other lotteries.
The disunity of the villagers arranges a hunt for the watertight, and an irreparable watertight curse will come upon Jonah’s head.
And now Konvic's sweetheart, Caroline, will do it!
How do you put old Hastbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and release him from the oath?
The story was recorded in the ČT studies in September 2010 and in the exteriors of the fisher Fastin, the Obdenices in Sedlčansk and in the beautiful setting of the historical mill in Hoslović.

During most of the disease is mild, only three percent of those infected must be hospitalized
Whether Czech is spreading the milder form of coronavir, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
The infection department of the hospitals is semi-empty, even though the numbers are growing.
"The situation today and in April is quite different and it is given primarily by the number of hospitalized people," says Minister of Health Adam Vojtich.
It is worth recalling that on 11 April, when the first wave of the epidemic hit us, all of us were carrying rags, taking the army, the republic was closed and using disinfection for the year ahead.
Still, ten people died a day.
Now the daily increase in the number of infected is higher, but every day with the covid-19, there are no more than two people dying.
The highest number of people infected still has Karvinska, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to a fire in the local Alzheimer's Centre, where there are 57 already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors was closed by the surgeons in Montenegro at Královéhradeck.
The disease confirmed tests in one of the nurses.
"We travel, we restrict movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says the home-retirement director Martin Schaniel.
According to him, none of the clients at home have any disease symptoms yet.
The general tests will begin with the hygienics tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
The increased number of infected people also reacts to the hospital.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which knows if people have a mounted gun at the entrance.
The record reports South American hygiene workers who have recorded fifty cases of coronavir - most of them are foreign employees of a labor company.
A total of 131 people were infected on Saturday - half Friday - but less is being tested on the weekend.
The champion champion!
Van den Bergh dopsal kohádku, Anderson smethl
The big surprise tournament on behalf of Dimitri van den Bergh led to an excellent performance even in the fight with the player, which was won by the second most prestigious company in the PDC in 2018.
The opening of the match was bilaterally balanced, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian shooter.
Van den Bergh took a 13-chip leg break and has had a cover ever since.
His opponent literally smashed his game and much more experienced "Flying Scott" was just getting to doubles.
The way in which he had "the Creator of Dreams" in his pack also testifies to the fact that the scattered Anderson played his first maximum until the 24th leg.
In addition, a young Belgian man managed a very high checkout.
Last time, he lost in the eleventh leg, but "he caught a big fish" in an unfavorable state and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson saw huge frustration.
He just threw his arrows and his triumphalist rival did absolutely sovereign.
Van den Bergh immediately changed the first of three darts and got his name - wrote his big dream.
The win of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to a Belgian shooter than it is to be his first won major.
It still pays so much that the last player who managed to defeat van den Bergha is Karel Sedláček.
Nantes was charged with the fire of the cathedral, the man admitted
The cathedrals of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday, and the fire seriously damaged the original windows of the 16th century and destroyed the barricades.
Fire investigation investigators have verified that the fire was operating from three different locations.
At the same time, the police found no sign of anyone entering the cathedral being raped.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, twenty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then she let her go without starting a criminal complaint.
Now the prosecution informed that on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, admitted and faced with charges of burning.
In case he is found guilty, he is threatened with up to ten years of imprisonment and high punishment.
According to his lawyer, a man regrets the act and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtich: We present "semafor" on Monday for epidemiological measures
The new system is to play the role of a pandemic plan, which has led to the absence of government and the Ministry of Health Criticism.
"They will gradually be based on the power of community expansion," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian region or Prague would reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional because the situation in each country varies significantly and has been complemented.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS).
Specific measures will be imposed at individual levels, according to the Minister, on the obligation to wear towels or to organise special departments in hospitals.
In order to create an epidemiological plan on TV, Prime Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for clear information on what measures could be expected if the epidemiological situation worsened.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtich commented that nothing in the main incident is on the spot to talk about declaring an emergency or calling the crisis team again.
In view of the increasing number of people infected since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has once again imposed an obligation to wear Russians on internal actions of more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be reduced to 500 people, now making up 1,000 people.
The government's procedure, when it was not clear until the last moment, what measures were taken and when they began to apply, and when they were not announced, was critical.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should create on the contrary a sense of security and the confusion to the contrary," said Senator Marek Hilšer in Question Time.
The measures may now vary according to the region, for example, in Prague since Sunday, the obligation to wear towels even in non-resident medical facilities, for example in medicines or in check boxes at the doctor’s office.
The obligation to wear Russians when visiting health and social facilities or medicines has been introduced since Friday also in the Liberian and Ústecka region.
At the University of Jihlavsk, it is necessary to wear towels in the interior of public spaces, in the MHD and in the health facilities since 14 July.
On the other hand, the anti-epidemic measures in the Moravian region have been released, as in the Central Czech Republic in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved a so-called semafor for Europe, which colourfully distinguishes the rate of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from those countries.
In countries with a low and moderate risk, the authorities do not require a negative test for or instead do not prescribe quarantine for Czech citizens from 15 June.
They are obliged to return Czechs from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in the low risk category of infection.
Technoparty to Benešovsk continues.
Plays on third-party capacity, ending on Monday
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovska) Technoparty at Hlaváčkova Lhota to Benesovsk continues on Sunday evening.
He still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to the evening estimates of the police here after 20:00, there are about 500 people left, the original rough estimates were talking about three hundred, they were at 900 in the morning, said police spokesman Lucie Novaková.
Originally, the technologists were supposed to end on Sunday afternoon, during which the really part of the music systems had been silenced.
"Some have already left and others are going to leave.
Music production is still in part.
We expect it to come gradually to disconnect and rip music systems," Novoková said.
"Police officers are still constantly monitoring outgoing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or conventional substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo preventive breathing tests before leaving," she added.
There are dozens of police officers on the scene, foreign police on the scene, transport and police on the scene, and in the emergency there are also dogs on the line.
"During today's day, the police checked 470 people moving at the event site and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, of which six were sitting on the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers tested the presence of misleading and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police have also solved 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the technical party, the police carried out 300 preventive breathing tests and four preventive tests on the presence of misleading and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants didn't go down, the police would be there.
In the TV series, Prime Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said so.
However, the number of participants was reduced by 1,000, so the police assessed that there was no need for action and did not ask for it by a health station or health department.
On Sunday, the Czech TV (ČT) stated that the technoparties had also expanded to surrounding lands whose owners did not agree with the use of the technoparties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim compensation for the damage.
The technologists at Hlaváčkova Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
The police initially watched a loop in Blažim in Benešovsk on Friday, where the tech parties took place last night.
Blažim is about 30 km from Hlaváčkova Lhota, where the technicians finally settled.
According to Novak, no one came to Blažim.
Serpenting: Girl's finished in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded on the Iron Nordsk.
The snake stuck the girl in the leg there, the year 2010, which parents themselves brought to that base of the rescue service," said Deník, a regional health rescue spokesman, María Svobod, who then took the child to the hospital in Klatov.
The snake is the only poisonous garden in the Czech Republic, and just in Shumave these animals appear in a higher number, so it is good to take care of them during the walks.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the snakes will bite you isn't too high, they're afraid of each other when they're in regular contact.
And if there's room for that, he likes to slip away for the vote.
He'll only attack if he feels very threatened - for example when you're mistakenly snooping on it.
Even though her sting is not a tragedy, her poison is very effective against the little savories, but people will not die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weak organism or suffers from an allergy.
The risk is, therefore, primarily for children, seniors and allergies.
"A person often has a feeling of rejection, then, has an increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in the case of weak individuals and, in particular, allergies, may come to an anaphylactic shock," said Deník Miriam Gredová from Klatov's Hospital.
The man threatened to throw the quacks out of the window.
After the cop lil wine and throw the cup
After 23:00, an assault unit entered the apartment and the men stopped.
The officers were immediately taken into care by the health professionals, who reported to the press the local police spokesperson Markét Janovská.
The man didn't want to cooperate with the cops, after the police spokesperson threw a cupboard, a knife, or a glass of wine out of the window.
His threats several times during the negotiations were reinforced by his touching the child from the window.
One day he even went out on his own to the umbrella window where he was entering.
The men's police are still investigating.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.
Stosur gives priority to your daughter before the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur won't be in contact with the coronary season anymore this year.
Twenty-six-year-old US Open 2011 champion, who became a mother in June, but doesn't want to finish his career yet.

WTA Tour will restore from March to the end of the 3rd August Antuk tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Rasie discovered meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area carried 1320 pieces of hatching eggs of unknown origin, in addition under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be destroyed in the slaughterhouse," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the farm with live fish, it was found that the seller had no proof of the origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, during the fall, the veterinarians discovered an illegal food store, which contained almost half a tons of unmarked food without proof of origin.
In most cases, the date of consumption could not be established, some of the products had a period of durability and were infected.
In the five kilograms of sepia, the durability date was exceeded by three years.
In May, veterans with policemen in the area of the market held 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, olives or frozen ducks, which were part of the mold.
Putin phoned Zelenski before starting a truce in Donbas, Kreml criticises the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone to his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where new arrangements are due to begin at midnight.
Putin, according to Kremla's statement, criticised, among other things, the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kyev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
On Wednesday evening, the Ukrainian and Russian negotiators agreed to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
It should start after midnight on Monday, be "full and universal" and open the way for further provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin said in his discussion to Zelenski that the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections would oppose the peace agreement from Minsk and threaten the prospects for resolving the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the upcoming elections to local representations would not take place in the territory of the Peruvian rebels.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kyiv will regain control of the Ukrainian separatists occupied with Russia after granting these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections.
According to the Union Agency, the Green Office stated that both states agreed on the benefits of the approach in Donbas and on the need to take further measures to promote peace in this region, such as the elimination of fighting areas or the removal of parts of units from the front.
Zelensky also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement has helped to stop fighting, but in occasional gunfights and gunfights on both sides of the front, people are still dying.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West charge Russia with military support from separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made his priority since the end of the war in Donbas, a major breakthrough in the negotiations but has not yet been reached.
The unexpected master in the 10th is Rykl, the seventh power of Novotná
Defender of the last two titles He didn't get to the end of the Saturday program four times, Kopecky didn't jump the base on Sunday.
For a long time, the Latvian representative, Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for the Joseph Karaz watch group, has been on the record.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside of the MCHR so far, this time he was the only ten-year-old who got across the seven-month border.
Other medals followed by Vilem Straský and Petr Urbanek.
After the contest, he recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiri Sykora.
"It's a shame there weren't guys here and Kope didn't start, because that would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I've given myself a person 30 centimeters away.
Then I was still pleased with the point and the most disappointed me was probably the disc, there I was on average," he admitted on his facebook.
The first day of the seven-balls won with more than a hundred percent weight of Katerina Cachová, despite being hit by a wounded ankle on the back legs.
In the remote sector, however, she then recorded only 570 cm, did not cross 40 meters and did not enter the final ossuary.
The novotna collected 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Katerina Dvořákov.
She's got her way, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630s.
Yesterday I started pulling a trigger, but I'm really glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't really make me feel like it," Novotna said on her facebook.
To the Czech Republic, bio LPG promises organic production
The liquefied Petroleum Gas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its essentially lower price against petrol or oil, given a significantly lower consumption tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like gasoline and oil, it also has its ecologically safe option - "bio LPG".
However, this is quite a news - firstly, in the European market there has been an introduction to the Czech press report by the Czech LPG Association a few days ago.
"In these days we have received the first fifteen tons of LPG bio, which will be distributed in a mixture with the classic fossil LPG at our pumping station," says Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, bioLPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or bionaphth.
According to the association, the chemical side is compatible with the classic LPG oil, which is now tanking into its motorists' cars.
That's why it's also possible to mix both versions willingly.
"The only difference against the classic LPG is the way of production," says Bio LPG Ivan Indraček, president of the association.
This is also one of the major advantages of LPG against other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, for example when compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the manufacture of bioethanol from residues of food and sugar beet.
In the future, targets should also be made, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
On the other hand, the classic LPG produces partially as a by-product in oil refining, partly as a separation in the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the technology of production and the source of the car’s operation on the LPG bio by 40-70% is more environmentally sustainable than on the carbon footprint than on the LPG oil and by up to 90% compared to oil.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from car exhaust, but about the fuel production ecology, i.e. part "well-to-tank" (Czech "source to tank").
One of the largest manufacturers of bio LPG is currently owned by petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan on Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is examining the possibility of production and its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170 thousand vehicles are driving to LPG; the Ministry of the Environment introduces in the NAP ČM a slightly higher number, about 200 thousand.
According to the transport ministry statistics last year alone, almost 6 thousand car conversions were carried out at the LPG.
Filming LPG is possible in the Czech Republic at about 950 different stations of operators.
Vojtius checked the number of infected, number dropped by 1775 cases
The Minister of Health Adam Vojtich (for the UN) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers of coronavir infected.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
On Sunday, the number fell from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 less infected.
Thus, 3422 patients are currently in the Czech Republic.
"After a jump in the number of cures, there is a review of data that have not been able to update hygiene lately," said the chief of health statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
On Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected with coronavir in the Czech Republic, 11,419 were cured and 371 Cavid-19 diseases were unfortunately suffered.
Mobile election units or correspondence.
Politologist and sociologist were looking for options for a pandemic
In order to allow people in quarantine to vote in the October regional and Senate elections for coronation, it is necessary to amend the law, according to the Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáčka (ČSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He introduced it on Sunday at the Prima TV Party.
He wants to discuss a possible solution with the representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry on Tuesday.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change of electoral law," Hamáček said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that the provisions of the law would need to be amended, according to which people in quarantine could not vote for their health status.
For example, the prohibition of choice should be maintained for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop, in the order of the OVM, stated that the possibility of a corresponding election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the camera, then counts with its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, the Prokok considers the concern of UN or ČSSD (because it would rather be recorded by other types of parties from abroad) from the corresponding election as overrated.
It is personally against the possibility of an electronic vote, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klima said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (choices) that could be achieved by now this year and with the least health risk.
He then considered himself ready for the year 2021 when parliamentary elections were to be held in the Czech Republic.
Corresponding choice (whether in a foreign country or also in Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
As another example, he sees the election units already mentioned or perhaps the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - the elections during the time of coronavir - were resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
As a result of the spread of coronation, various types of elections have already been postponed in 67 countries around the world.
Protests in Buharsk: Prussian ears threw demonstrators at the government building
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borisov and his cabinet were at the building of a pig's ear government.
It was another of the series of protests against the "Mafia style of government", which have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for nearly three weeks.
The organisers are planning a state-wide blockade on Wednesday, as the DPA Agency has said.
Today's protest, which has taken place on the 18th day after it, has had less participation than before, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom.
At 20:00, about 300 people met, some streets had to be closed for transport.
Demonstrators in front of the building government received a theatre scene, symbolically locked up in the prison cell of Prime Minister Boris and Attorney General Ivan Gešev in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the government.
Both resignations are part of the basic protesting requirements.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hadjigenov, today in public law, stated that on Wednesday, "the top escalation" is going to be in the form of "celonnational demonstrations in Sofia and blockades throughout the country".
He reiterated his demand for Boris's resignation and his government, as well as for early elections.
Those proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Boris's already told me he wasn't going to resign.
He justified this by, among other things, the need to implement the Bulgarian pandemic of the Cuvid-19 and resulting from the economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, even though the protestor's resignation had not calmed down.
At the beginning of this week, Boris's government stopped voting in parliament on Parliament's confidence.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic doesn't want games without spectators anymore
Boloni Siniša Mihajlovic, a football coach, already has enough matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian spy hopes that the fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
"What we're currently operating here is not football.
I already have full teeth for games without spectators.
It's a sexless football, it doesn't give me any emotion, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
To play like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks it," Mihajlovic said before today's fight against Lecce.
After the coronation break, the series A matches follow in quick succession, and although they play until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in the terrible weather.
Under such conditions, he won't even know what the teams are like.
By the end of this season.
These measures had to be taken to win the competition, but I hope that by September the fans will be back," said a viewer who in the past also led Fiorentina or AC Milan.
For Mihajlovice, this season is unusual because of the lack of four months of leukemia treatment.
"In spite of my illness, the League's interruption and all the others, our team has managed to move to a higher level.
We want further growth and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become targets of the cyberattack of foreign states, Iran claims.
Since the end of June, a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear installations, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and companies, have been reported fires and explosions.
Some Iranian agents claimed that the fire that broke out this month in underground nuclear operations in Natanz could cause cyber sabotage.
The reason for a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry Speaker Abbas Musawi told reporters according to Iranian media that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic is facing "thousands of cyberattacks" every day.
He added that it's not about a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to reflect.
In recent months, according to Musavi, several broader cybernetic attacks have been recorded, followed by an analysis of "specific governments and groups".
However, Reuters did not share any more details about possible offenders.
It must also be added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
This month, the Iranian state agency's article IRNA discussed that Iran's enemies, like Israel and the United States, could have been following recent incidents.
None of these countries were charged directly with specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the US Embassy in Tehran and held as hostage 52 Americans for 444 days.
Long-term tensions between the two countries intensified in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions against Iran, which have a strong impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US Army killed Iranian General Kásem Soleymanje and a member of the Iraqi militia Abu Mahdi Muhandise on 3 January.
Iran then set fire on January 8th to the bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate, the amount of rockets.
The United States has repeatedly admitted that tens of American soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its primary enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main supporter of the 2015 International Nuclear Agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
The TPCA car has extended the production suspension until May 25th.
The Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) car again extended the production suspension due to coronavir.
The production lines should be relaunched on Monday 25 May in the morning.
The race will follow dozens of hygiene measures, said speaker cars Tomáš Paroubek.
The product is due to the pandemic of coronavir from the evening of March 18th.
Originally, the company was planning to renew it on Monday, 18 May.
The reason for the extension of the stay is according to Paroubka closed border and closed dealership, so the car has no one to sell.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavir affects the company’s key markets, such as Italy, Great Britain or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Modification for the Colin) said that the production suspension in TPCA is not signed up in the city.
"At first it was known, it was empty in the city.
But the street is gradually being filled, especially since Monday, when it's got a lot of fun.
So the city is full," Kašpar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed in their homes.
"In those two months we didn't have to solve almost no problem," Kaspar said.
For example, the Juvenile Szkoda Auto, which, due to the coronary crisis, also discontinued production, renewed it on Monday, 27 April, in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the competitions works at 100 percent of the capacity.
The restoration of production in the Union was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday in Mladé Boleslavi and Quasináh, the third, i.e. night shift, took place for the first time after the renewal of production.
At TPCA, about 2,500 people are currently working and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time employees in Kolinsk.
Cancer killed a bride shortly after the wedding: Leave a message to the family
More than two years ago, Gemma Sison struggled with cancer, and when it seemed that she had overcome cancer, the disease came back.
A 20 - year - old woman who loved culturalism finally ended up in a hospital bed where she had enough to take her life's love.
Unfortunately, the impotent has fallen asleep.
A few hours after her death, her account on the facebook social network revealed a shocking message for the closest.
Gemma Sisson from English Leeds loved culturalism.
With friend Rick Moore, who lived with him for more than 16 years, they traveled in competitions around the world.
Twenty-nine-year-old woman sportsed and lived healthy, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, hoping she'll recover.
After months of treatment it really seemed that Gemma was able to overcome cancer, but in August 2019, cancer returned and this time attacked a fifth.
A culturalist and personal coach according to British daily Mirror reportedly underwent ten-hour operation at the back and then resumed drastic treatment.
But everything was empty.
Early this year, at her 90 ’ s, her doctors informed her that she had a few months to live.
Finally, in April, a prominent blonde decided to come to Leeds' hostel, where she was visited every moment by her family, who even arranged for her wedding with her lover Rick.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky last took Gemma on their two-month anniversary to the restaurant.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, on her social network account, Gemma discovered a contribution she wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I cannot thank enough Ricky, who was on my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social network followers," she wrote, saying that everyone should respect his life and live it fully.
Machines for art sell travel list, amulet from fungus and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, most of the leading Czech artists get a rolling pocket work.
Images and other creations are made directly for artifacts, so they know first that they have to go into size 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Every piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said the curator of the project Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
The buyer can thus be surprised at what the artwork gets.
Currently, you may need to be the new owner of fancy illustrations of Alexandra Staplová or miniviews from Theresa Bonavatur, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Dutková prepared a pexeso associated with the Prague Pass.
The cards should be against the home signs.
Ilona Polanski created an Artmat tattoo collection.
Marie Ladrová and Juliana Chomová sell pockets of spirituality: the first of the art offers a protective amulet from the troudnat and magic card, the second series of illustrations based on her Spiritist comic.
Payments in health care will increase by up to five percent next year.
Greater elevations are unrealistic according to the Vatican
Health payments could increase by up to five percent next year, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for the UN) on Václav Moravce's television issues.
The requirement of experts to increase up to 15 per cent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should strive to be self-sufficient in providing protective aid.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that growth (wages) can be up to five percent somewhere," said the minister.
According to it, it is necessary to reflect the current situation in which it has been involved in the selection of an insured pandemic of coronavir and a government regulation against its proliferation since March.
The incomes insured fell at the time.
"I'm going to have an increase of 15% at this point in reality," Vojtich said.
The average monthly benefit of the doctor in emergency bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the salary of the sister in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data from UZIS also show that the loss of nurses in hospitals has been halted.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34 125 crowns in 2019 according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
In June, experts indicated that they would require a minimum increase of 10 per cent for 2021, ideally 15 per cent for 2021.
In the long run, they criticise the significant difference between the distribution of doctors and nurses in state hospitals which must be managed by pay tables and by contractual salaries in hospitals in cities, countries or private ones.
They therefore also require that the pay tables be uniform for healthcare professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, in the case of doctors, last year wages grew faster than wages.
According to the President of the Czech Stomatological Chamber of Roman Schmucler, experts should be aware of the state of affairs.
Recently, due to the effects of the epidemic, the House approved an increase in the annual government budget deficit of 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion are to be paid to health professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Health Care Providers according to Schmucler disagrees with a flat salary increase next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and the money should also go through the official statement.
He also stated that hospitals currently have many protective aids.
Pavel Švagr, President of the Administration of State Reserves (SSHR) said this week that the administration does not currently have any health aid in its possession.
Waiting for the completion of the selection procedure.
According to the Vatican, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were bought out.
According to him, the State should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
Screaming smart quarantine could take over the soldiers.
We're ready, they say.
"A smart quarantine works, of course, is to improve.
We're going to discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and it is a question of whether they should not run the whole thing again," the government president said on Sunday in his Facebook series Čau people.
According to him, it is not enough to connect IT systems and sanitary stations, which need to gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were according to the prime minister in the Moravian region, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
The Defence Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek told the ČTK that he did not have any information on Sunday's proceedings and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step, according to him.
The smart quarantine project took over the Ministry of Health on May 25th.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a ninety-first-class central management team established under the army as the government's advisory body, led by former Deputy Prime Minister Roman Prymula.
The moving project was criticised by the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
And he insisted that the army could take him again.
The shortcomings in the project were previously acknowledged by the government's IT officer and the digitisation of Vladimir Dzurilla, who is concerned.
"The system works, but it's still working on it.
Twenty years have come to an end alone and unsystemically, now we've been trying to unite for a few months.
It's not pressurized.
People on the way, poor people on the way, they adapt the new systems and actually catch up on the mistakes," he said.
The island primal Macura won't run again, because she doesn't want to "get caught up in politics"
The current island primacy Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the attempt "not to be fooled into politics," said the server Respect.cz.
Macura, at the same time a member of the UN Presidency of Movement, has been the prime minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, he received nearly a third of the vote by a leading UN candidate in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to serve only for four years.
"I said I'd hold on to one functional period and with that business experience, I'd be able to turn everything around and put it on my feet," said Respect.
He added that during the second election period he was allowed to negotiate to a certain extent.
"But it's the maximum for me.
I don't want to be fooled by that policy," Macura added, who in the conversation marked himself as a heavy introvert, which is not a good contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation about the possible end of Macro in the motion of the UN.
The server recalls that Macura has criticised the UN movement several times, for example for the association with the SPD movement or for the support of Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few ANOs, he supported Zeman's opposition candidate Jiří Dragosh in the elections.
Macura is not planning to leave from the movement of the UN, which he entered in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it's not a completely empty fight, and that no one is interested in it, I have no immediate motive to end it," said Respect.
60-year-old Macura studied at the University of Prague Economics.
Before becoming an island prime minister in 2014, Macura acted, among other things, as director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He's also in the organs of other companies.
Back to Brno Uber offering transport services
By the end of July, Uber will return, offering transport services.
This is the result of the amendment of the law, he stated on Thursday in the press release of the Board of Directors for Transport Petr Kratovíl (ODS).
Against Uberu in Brno, taxi drivers protested, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as a taxi or tax meter.
However, since July, changes have been made to the conditions for the operation of regular taxis and alternative taxis.
In recent weeks, he has completed several negotiations with Uber’s representatives.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratosíl said.
Uber acted in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him because of the lack of vehicle marking as a taxi or a missing tax meter.
The Court has issued preliminary measures which have prevented Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported the taxi driver, but last year, the mayor of Markéta Vanjková (ODS) indicated that the city would want to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to subsequent court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
Now he's coming back on the basis of a change of law.
Since July, it is clear that by the classic taxis, the light and tax meter can be more easily operated by the transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too bubbling celebration in Brno: the flying chair reached a meter from the man on the walkway
From the fourth floor, the apartment flew out on Saturday night in Brno's office chair and reached about a meter from the hallway.
He was followed by a walker who called the guards immediately.
Immediately after arriving at that address in the western part of the city, she noticed an open window, under which she was still lying in the chairs and next to it several backpacks and non-slips.
"The movement that moved from the room in the fourth step indicated that there was a relatively loud celebration within.
The guards walked out to the apartment and asked three young men from the age of sixty to ninety years for an explanation," said the spokespersons of Jakub Ghan.
Call request Rafaje talks to Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans on Monday with coalition social democrats to discuss a request for the appeal of the head of the antitrust office (UOHS) Petra Rafaje.
Rafaje has been called upon by non-profit organisations to negotiate the anti-corruption council of the government and also by the Ustek country.
Social Democrats say the exchange in the head of the office is in place.
According to the information provided by the Czech Republic, Rafaj was not invited to the Government's Office on Monday.
His second term of office will end in the next half of the year, and under the law he cannot be appointed a third.
His appeal is in the hands of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the call for non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the State of Ústecka.
That's why they're supposed to be, among other things, Rafaj's cases lately.
Last week, the prime minister refused to express his claim by getting acquainted with the materials and the government's views on the subject.
He also stated that he had not dealt with the challenges so far with the President, that he had no meeting with him at the nearest time.
According to ÚOHS, there is no reason for the appeal because Rafaj was not accused of anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz wrote last week that the police are interested in Rafaj's meeting with the Heitman Jiřim Chunk.
The meetings were linked, inter alia, to the competition decision on the project of a controversial new lynch hospital of eight billion, which Chunk is strongly promoting.
The kid admitted to the meeting, according to him, they solved his senate activity together.
It's the same with Rafaj.
The representative of the country of Ústecka to appeal to Rafaje called on the government at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Authority.
The decision of the ÚOHS on public procurement by the Heitman Transport Office of Jaroslav Komínka is not transparent and has signs of discretion.
Last March, police raided the antitrust office because of a myth selection trend.
This June, the server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj is using apartments written on the company of influential background player ČSSD Alexandra Čuby.
The 3.5 million-dollar deposit to the apartment in Brno was paid out of Rafaj's account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Competition is Rafaj since 9 July 2009, the former President of the former Member of Social Democracy appointed in June 2015 for the second term of office.
In a few years' time, Rafaj's second six-year term of office will be over.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Authority on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it does not perform a function for more than six months or seriously violates the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
The staff were collapsing in the library of Blana.
Helps with air conditioning
The new technology will be 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in the centre of Blanca regularly.
In warm months, however, it was practically impossible to survive.
There was terrible air and bad air.
Winding didn't help.
That's why I'm happy for the air conditioning," said one of the Balan readers Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library of Lukaše Dlapa, the temperature in the building was often splintered to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the object is glassy, and in the sunny days it acts as a glass.
"The sun also supports a large part of the day thanks to the bending of the building.
At the same time, it is a major problem for the individual department to blow up, because overnight it has to be closed for safety reasons.
Often we have been in the library since the morning to thirty degrees," said Dlap.
The worst part was the studio and the reading room on the third floor.
And about four, then the showrooms and the directorate.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's room, which is under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that librarians at work collapsed and ended up in incapacity.
The problem was also common in the cultural rooms at lectures that dozens of people attend.
A few minutes later, she couldn't breathe," said Dlap.
Originally, representatives of the city wanted to make air conditioning this year in all the library spaces.
In the end, there will be only three circles of five.
"Only the most problematic areas will have climate change due to limited funding.
The studio and the reading room on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department on the floor above," said Jiři Svoboda from the Balkan Investment Board.
He added that in the first phase, workers in the fall installed air equipment and adjusted the installation in the space mentioned.
About 360 thousand crowns.
The city library Blanco has almost three thousand registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years.
Chicago's resistance to the coronation virus.
Crawford is going back to the game
Not every infected athlete will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, who keep silent about their health as a grave and don't publish anything at all.
Like one of the little ones came out of Crawford.
A 50-year-old relative from Montreal was present at first training only, since then he was missing in the composition.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been positively tested on Covid-19 and, for this reason, I have spent the last fourteen days locked up in my house," he explained the reason for my absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into full load.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do everything in my power to get into shape as soon as possible," he added.
An experienced golman has won with Chicago two Stanley Cups, a firm part of the branch is already the tenth season in line.
Blackhawks is waiting for the first ready duel with St. Louis, then they'll be facing Edmonton in advance.
Thousands in Israel protested against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelites in several parts of the country protested against unemployment, corruption, and the way in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu solved the crisis.
The event took place, inter alia, in front of the Netanyahu private villa in the city of Caesarea, near its official residence or in the park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been taking place regularly for several weeks.
Its participants demand Netanya's resignation for the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also for how the government solves another wave of the coronary plague.
"Bib, go home," wrote one of the AP's demonstrators to his transparency, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known surname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," he said.
The seventy-year-old Netanyahu is Israel's first prime minister bound for the performance of his duties.
He is accused of three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
Every charge denies and marks them as a witch hunt.
According to local media, the process may take up to three years, and more than 300 witnesses are called.
The SARS-COV-2 coronation virus has been confirmed in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, in almost 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the infection.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped to reduce the daily growth of infected people.
After the gradual release of the restrictions from the end of April, but especially at the end of June, the number of infected again began to rise significantly.
Notanyahu's critic claims that the government has not helped enough, for example, with quarantine measures.
The protester also finds that the government in the framework of the fight against coronavir issues dissuasive instructions.
The driver broke the car over the tree and died.
The body had to cut the firemen out of the back
A tragic accident took place around 23 o'clock at Neveklov for a short time leading from the Slapsje overhaul.
The driver probably ran into a lot of speed down to the woods and broke the car over the tree.
He's dead in place.
The body had to get rid of the firefighters, among other things, cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being checked by the police.
They ordered a drink that should be explained except if a man did not drive under the influence of alcohol or other conventional substances.
End of spitting and nailing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and it will be a major change in the strategy.
He's breaking down the discounts and he doesn't want to scratch one collection after another anymore.
The fact that fashion industry is one of the biggest environmental polluters is not new.
There are billions of pieces of clothing in the furnaces and warehouses each year.
View of slow fashion, often distorted access to clothing, but in recent years it has changed relatively quickly.
About half of Peter’s goods sold to Philip for the full price.
The second half, which was sold through discounts, just won't buy.
The company does not want to crush one collection after another and at the end of each season the products will be discounted at their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner of Michal Mitchka, new and old collections and blind follow-up are away quickly with changing fashion trends.
"Most traders are already counting on discounts when buying goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
It's actually a little trick," says the owner of Pietro Filipi Michal Micka.
In addition, the company wants to support local business through its approach.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We stress that much of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - that is, clothing that is overtime and overseasonal.
The worldwide premium brand segment of any discount is typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed," Mička adds.
The huge graffiti represents the flight of the RAF Kurt Taussiga
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our complaining pilot fighting in the ranks of British Royal Flight in World War II.
The proposal liked the city's leadership," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive creation.
He consumed about 300 liters of color and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplích-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war for his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an international camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother were able to avoid concentration camps thanks to Nicholas Winton's organization.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in Great Britain, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) and then studied pilot training in South Africa and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the summit revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and the native Teplice, who granted him honorary citizenship.
The 60-year-old Kamil Vacek, whom people in the street art industry know under the name of Camo, has been working spraying in the streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the surfaces that the then primacy of Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) was part of for these purposes.
Hurricane Hanna reached the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of Texas on Saturday afternoon at local time (before midnight SELČ night to-night).
He struck the Texas Island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and weakened on the tropical storm when he moved over the mainland.
However, according to meteorologists, it poses a major danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
He brought with him strong wind and intense precipitation; together with local floods, electrical accidents and various material damage, including damaged ships, have been reported by the AP agency.
The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, announced the state of natural disasters on Saturday for 32 periods in southwest Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The most powerful warning was given by people from the coastal zone between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay, but overall he was supposed to have lived to reach the area nearly 500 kilometres long before moving gradually across northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising colds, a dangerous relationship and a united tornado can pose a threat," warned the U.S. National Centre for Hurricanes (NHC).
This morning of local time (in the afternoon SELČ) the storm moved across the American-Mexico border and accompanied it with a wind speed of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane this year in the Atlantic.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was driven by a wind of up to 145 kilometers an hour, but the wind gradually weakened to 112 kilometres an hour, which evaporated Hanna from the Hurricane category again.
Local authorities have called for the storms to cross the house and not forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas is one of those states in the United States that use most of the pandemic of covid-19 disease.
Given the current security measures and the need to comply with the derogations, there is a great challenge and possible evacuation.
The supervisory roofs were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas period Hidalgo was also one of the buildings adapted as shelters after evacuation, which had a positive test for coronation virus or were otherwise exposed to infections.
Local authorities have called for all evacuated to take Russian and disinfectant gels with them, if possible.
"We're not even far behind.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted the agency AP Chrise Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville.
Forecasts say that in some places it could be up to 300 millimetres of precipitation for a few hours, in some cases it could be 500 millimetres long, which could flood a number of sea level.
Zeman will borrow Colonel Lipkov's general value
President Miloš Zeman will pass the general value of Colonel Paul Lipkov on Wednesday.
This results from a review of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for borrowing the value of the Brigadier General is the August entry of Lipka to the post of deputy commander of the alliance multinational division of the northern regions of Poland.
Lipka has so far acted as a representative of the commander of the earthly forces of the Czech army.
The increase in Zeman at the end of June was proposed by the government.
July from the beginning of August replace Brigadier General Karl Röhk as the deputy commander of the multi-national division of the north-east of Poland Elblag, which directs the units of the Allied pre-eminent presence in the territory of Poland and Pobalt.
Greece became Director of the National Office for Cybersecurity and Information Security (NUKIB) in March.
The government has proposed to the president that Lipkov borrow the value of the Brigadier General.
Under the Civil Service Act, a higher value may be borrowed from a soldier during the term of office of the elected function or during the period of service required to borrow a higher value.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division shall correspond to the general value.
The soldier to whom the value was borrowed has the same rights and obligations as if he were appointed to that value.
However, he has no claim to adjust the salary that would correspond to those values.
Borrowing of value is a matter of forgetting the reason for which it was granted.
"Col. Lipka shows a high professional readiness and is a model for the subordinates.
It participates significantly in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for an increase.
The mid-term increase will take place at 12:30 p.m. on Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for the travel of aircraft to help limit the spread of the new coronavir.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer announced it.
Among the agreed standards is the compliance with the departure or carriage of rifles in the aircraft and at the airport, but the average seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
She reported on that agency Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree to these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the officials had concluded the agreement and that it still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures shall include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from six years of age, to comply with the recommended derogation from safety checks and landings at the airport.
The aircraft must also be provided with sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules on which the officials have agreed shall at least meet certain requirements of the airlines.
Different standards have caused confusion.
At the Arctic Spiccberk, the temperature record was dropped, and it was about 22 degrees.
"In Longyearbyen, 41 years old record fell," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, and by 0.4 degrees she beat the 1979 record.
The ridge of the 2,000-year-old Longyearbyen is the largest city in the Spicberk, located some 1,300 kilometers from the north.
Spitzbergs are heating faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the danger arising from the warming of other ends of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, the last report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies states.
The average temperature in the Spicberk has grown from the 1970s to the 20th century by three to five degrees.
By 2100, it can even rise by ten degrees, unless the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is reduced.
The increase in temperature may result from the ever-frozen landification in the Spicberk, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can also lead to greater quantities of lava and suction.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or sharks, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Brits who come back from Spain are waiting for a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain, which are not necessary, due to the risk of spreading the disease.
So the Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after their return, people must be in isolation for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomat stated in her statement.
"We have always made it clear that in case it is necessary, we will remove a country immediately from the list of those safe ones," she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement would affect thousands of British travel plans.
Spain belongs to a very popular holiday destination.
The British are concerned, among other things, whether they will be paid sickly if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after their return from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne made a ten-day vacation on Lanzarote, they had to fly on Tuesday.
The train has been ordered since December.
"We were supposed to go all family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a driver, and I don't think my employer will agree that I'll be back from a two-week vacation in quarantine," quoted the Metro Hunter daily.
In relation to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
During the last two days, over 900 newly infected people have always been there within 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already aggravating coronavir measures, for example, Catalan is trying to limit every night’s life and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out the increased risk of infection in Catalan, Aragon, Basque and Madrid.
The model of the purchase of electricity from Dukovan is passed by the government
On Monday, the government conducts a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovana Nuclear Power Plant.
The draft law is based on the fact that in the event that the price of the purchase will be higher than the price of electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
Second, where the ransom price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be different.
Power power is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for the UN) and the ČEZ energy company have previously stated that the most likely option is for people to save electricity by building.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook of electricity prices in the markets is always unrealistic, which has shown developments in the past several times.
The focus has already been criticised by environmental organisations.
"The ransom price can be both below the market price of the power plant and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the safe - at lower consumption or at higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) stated in the basis of the material.
In May, the Hawliček stated that it assumes that the wholesale price of electricity growth and people in the Dukovan building are making.
Otherwise, the impact of tens of crowns per family year will be less than the amount of electricity charged each year to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the ransom price could be between 50 and 60 euros (approximately 1320 to 1600 CZK) for megawatthodina (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any proposal for an amount to be included in the redemption contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for the year 2021, at which traders are now most stocked, currently amounts to around 45 euros (approximately 1190 Kč) per MWh.
"With the difference between the redemption price and the market prices of electricity of up to ten euros, an average household premium of 3.3 MWh per year - can correspond to four-member households, standard equipped with electricity consumers including electric safe plates and pipes, but not using electricity for heating and heating hot water - less than 100 Kč/year," wrote the MPO government.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
Pandemie coronavir has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term predictor of market prices to be an expressive speculative matter," the CEO of the Energy Financial Group Tomáš Voltr said earlier.
The proposed law is based on the fact that the payment would be carried out by the MPO, the legal person owned by the State, respectively, at the pre-determined price.
The contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated, but not later than the end of the operation of low carbon production.
The low-carbon production proposal defines as a nuclear power plant connected to an installed power system with a minimum power output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
The Havlíček earlier stated that the new Dukovan block should have a power of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthodins of electricity annually, corresponding to the ten expected Czech consumption.
The block should be placed on the market in 2036.
The model of funding for the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed without delay during the construction process, with a two-percent interest rate for the operation.
The financing model does not agree with the opposition, it also disturbs the possibility that the Dukovans would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should share 70 percent in the construction.
The balance should be paid by ČEZ, which will also bear all possible additional costs.
ČEZ Director General Daniel Beneš said in May that the expected amount for building a block at current prices is about EUR 6 billion (approximately SEK 162 billion).
Contracts between the State and the Czech Republic on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has downloaded material to support tourism in the media in two billion
Material, according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holiday in the Czech Republic, two billion crowns, the office of observation has been set aside.
Minister Klara Dostálová (for the UN) of the List ofNews.cz said that the material is still working.
The eKlepu document (e-book of the legislative process) was pointed out on Friday by the server Zdoverzy.cz.
The Ministry of Plans has justified the collapse of the travel movement due to coronavir.
During the coronation crisis, revenue and media declined.
The proposal called for criticism of the opposition and representatives of the travel movement.
According to the proposal, which is now to be viewed on the watchstat.cz web site, MMR planned to give money through the state agency to support travel CzechTourism on advertising on television, advertising, press, on the Internet, billboards or stations.
The biggest part of the money, and that's 700 million crowns, they'd get TV.
Most people would get private TVs from Nova and Prima.
Pressed newspapers and weeklys would get 400 million and the same share would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Advertising stations would receive 350 million for a media campaign, most of which would be private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and platforms on stations or in the subway.
The campaign to support travel in the Czech Republic should start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still working on, it is certainly not in the form that should be presented," said Dostálová without further details from the List of News server.
The material criticised the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markets of Pekar, Adam would benefit from advertising media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andreje Babiše (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this apparent humiliation will be achieved in the fall at the election of the morning between the eyes," she wrote on Twitter.
In fact, he denies that it is a media crisis.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," Dinik N said on Friday.
According to it, the budget is two billion indicative.
"We're, of course, counting it, it could be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
Initiatively Save Tourism does not give a media campaign to support domestic tourism sense.
"We want two billion for companies in travel, not an excessive advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, president of the initiative on Sunday.
If those two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should direct companies, not the media, to the government's open letter of initiative.
Life-forming, brewing and death as grass stem
The third album titled And death is the stem of the Brno poet's grass, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and the publisher of Jaroslav Erik Friče, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Frič's discography is the fifth entry, and as in previous titles, here is the main emphasis on Frič's poetry, which is the very outstanding interpreter.
Frič, 1949, was appreciably influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration passed through his own, personal experiences and also very neutral expressions of faith.
However, some agitation was removed from the hooves, when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, totally tolerant.
I'm thinking in this context of God's Slav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zaradníč), the masters are passing.
Frič's album offers recordings of author reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always accompanied it very sensitively, whether it was the violinist Josef Klíč or Honza Barton and the Vítezslav Holata.
I will help - like - the words of Ostravian poet Peter Hrushka about the long poem compositions of Frič.
"The pride and inexhaustible bitterness of them," says Hruška, "is above the state of our world threatened by the ban.
The world, which is falling ever more into dense consumer vanity and greed, is increasingly turning away from what his soul was created out of the secret of faith, humility and human proximity.
There was a gap between those who knew that the values for which they were created were of little concern, but who also knew that they could not be denied for the sake of general interest.
Those poems remind us that a person may have to lose everything he loves, but it is not inconceivable in what way.
If he sells himself to a general decline, he sceptically resigns, he is afraid to shut up, or he remains at the last moment in calm and proud endurance of what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and President of the ČSSD Jiří Parubek is not a paid social democracy adviser.
The President of the Party and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamaček said that today in the Prima Party TV series.
The Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor, informed the server List ofNews.cz on Friday.
"From time to time, we write an essay, he will sometimes send me some material and I will read it," Hamáček said today.
He added, however, that it is not about official and paid cooperation.
According to ČSSD, it does not have the means to waste it for similar purposes.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, so many people are," he said.
In the ensuing discussion with the ODS Member, Jana Montenegro's Minister said that many members of the ODS are still "uncoverably listening to the views of Václav Klaus".
He said it was okay, because it is an experienced policy and a former president of the party, which is also the Paroubka case.
The fact that the media are doing an affair was marked as the mark of this year's corn season.
The server List ofNews.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Hamáčkov's informal consultant.
He also wrote that in the fourth place the party's candidate in the oral region was headed by a former president of the Petr Bend cell, who was associated with Paroubka and acted as vice president of his LEV 21 party.
Hamaček said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile jump, it's a kick in the ass, it's a Swede challenger.
The 22-year-old American sticker has ambition and potential to be among the most important competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to defeat a two-year-old Duplantis, who beat her last year at the NCAA Association.
"We had a fight a year ago, then he won, and I was the second, and then we threw it away.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," says Nilsen, who won the 5.95 meters.
Since then, however, Duplantis has fired a sharp blow and is currently in the highest points of the world alone.
In just twenty years he became a world recordman, this February 8th in Torun, he beat a blade of 6.17 meters, added another centimeter in Glasgow a week later.
"He jumped six meters in 18 years when he graduated from high school," recalls his Nilsen for the World Sports Web.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up from a boy in a man, all his potential and talent would be tenfold.
Twenty years is a good age for jumping the world record," he thinks.
Although Nilsen's number of successes is more accurate than the one who boasts of Duplantis, the American sets similar goals.
He pointed out his options at the NCAA competitions which he won on a regular basis, and this year he improved his internal personal record at 5,93 m. In August, he won gold medals at the Panamanian games in Lima, and in 2017, he was on his way to the U.S. World Championship, where he finished 13.
Then the closest lover is to taste the Diamond League for him for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get to the professional circle and run as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can no doubt lead as well on events such as the Olympics, the world championships or the panoramic games."
However, because of the pandemic, these top holidays are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and the others time to improve.
But will it be enough to get Duplantis, which easily the race under five circles can turn into a mere silver fight?
"Everyone is trying to reach it, but I don't think it will be possible as soon as possible," Nilsen thinks.
"That boy's been jumping for 16 years, and he's been in training for over every other mile."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, she's gonna want to raise it.
A woman has lost her pregnant son's disability pension.
There's a court waiting for her.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
A woman is threatened with eight years in prison for treason.
Because of his poor health, he was released by the court of the sick man of conscience and his mother set up a guardian who, among other things, was to manage the money of his sons.
"A woman from mid-November 2013 to January this year used part of her son's disability pension funds for her needs and so prepared 440 thousand crowns," police spokesman Dana Ladman said, arguing that the accused woman had a special obligation to pay attention to the injured.
The woman, according to the court's instructions, set up an account for her son because her pension had been transferred to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of the son in the hospital and the reimbursement of the necessary medicines, the remaining funds were used to buy vehicles, electricity consumers and households," the complaint was lodged.
That he can't use his son's money for his own needs, the woman confessed.
But she was embarrassed that she was helping them pay for their family expenses.
"We had problems with our incomes pulling the pace of the household.
We've never bought anything superstandard.
It was always about things that his son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't know that I was allowing this to happen," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been home for 30,000 years, hard scientists after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include weapons instruments, including fine sharps that could be used for cutting meat, and spicy objects that could be used as a tortoise or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest instruments come from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products here of this old man.
But they are here," said the archeologist Ciprian Ardelian from the University of Zacatecas and the lead author of one of the two studies that were published on this subject in Nature magazine.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500.
According to experts, the people of Chiquihuite caves, located at a high altitude, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, the generally accepted theory has said that the first representatives of the Homo sapiens species crossed the bridge from today's Russian territory to Alaska about 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique caves used to kill mammals and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Bolivian culture has subsequently expanded in much of North America.
But this model has been achieved in the last decades when several old settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
In the second study published in Nature magazine, there are 42 locations throughout North America that demonstrate human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that small numbers of people could have come to the North American fort before they were supposed to.
Some of them were able to get ships to America.
"It is obvious that people were in America long before the so-called Bolivian culture developed," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn from the University of Canada in the province of Albert.
So far, the interest in flights is filling up an optimistic scenario, a tough salesman.
Prices also gradually decrease
It sells flyers in the Czech Republic growing every week.
In contrast to last year’s summer, interest is still almost half as high, but demand increases by up to 20 percent every week.
Development after the crisis thus, according to the sellers, fills the most optimistic scenario.
The prices of the aircraft are decreasing gradually.
Among the most sought-after destinations are those of sellers, in particular of the South European countries.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At the Letuska.cz portal, flights to the Croatian Split are most sold.
From other countries, then, Britain is the most sought after, but it has always been one of the most difficult destinations.
The average price of flights is also reduced.
At the Portal Letuska.cz, approximately half a month, about 6250 crowns were moved, between 3,000 crowns less.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for a European destination, which now accounts for about 85 per cent of sales.
However, prices in some European places, such as Spain or Italy, have dropped by about five in recent weeks.
The crisis also affected the behaviour of customers who now buy airplanes with much lower preference than before because they are afraid of further development of the coronary situation.
According to previous information Kiwi.com, the time of purchase of the pre-flight flight was reduced by about ten days between year.
"It confirms our future trend, when people will order flights with much smaller fronts, they will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice President for Kiwi.com Michal Šindelář.
Currently, the average booking time is 21 days before departure.
Along with the increase in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic also rises.
At Prague airport there are currently regular lines running to more than 60 destinations.
Last summer's season is about half the destinations.
Big finals tonight!
Watch the shooting battle live on New Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC has reached the big final.
There is an experienced 19-year-old Scottish archer Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, the 60-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson took Justin Pip in the first round, then hit his neighbor in the table knife.
Even James Wade, however, took advice, and at the fourth final, he made a thorough deal with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home a world unit.
"Flying Scott" had plans at the semifinal when he was facing Michale Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the tombstones from the shovel, continued to dominate and after the result of 18:16 he fought a place at the final tournament, which he had already ruled in 2018, when he defeated Mensura Suljovice 21:19 in a wonderful battle.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoyed the tournament, and perhaps knowing that he had nothing to lose helped him to play a completely fantastic wave.
The 16-year-old shooter first surprised the world's six Nathan Aspinall, pushed Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and beat Adrian Lewis in a quarter-final.
A big check was semifinal.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the introduction, but in peace playing the Belgian series, he got a jump, which then kept most of his problems to the finish.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scores, with which he struck a temporary uncertainty on the doubles.
Coronavir cases occurred at least from the beginning of the week, decreased number of tests
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronation virus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has been reportedly infected by 15 212 people.
Nearly 9,600 of them were already cured, 368 patients died.
Currently, there are 5,254 people who are sick.
It comes from data on the Health Ministry's web site.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times as many as two hundred.
The maximum was Friday's 281 cases.
On Thursday, there were positive 235 tested, the day before 246 and Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have already been cured, 63 percent of all the infected so far.
In most cases, the disease was mild in duration.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavir are in the hospital, with 19 of them rated as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days are still showing Karvinsko, which is nearly 59.
Following is the period of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Mětecko with 36 people infected with 100 000 people in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected in Czech Republic, new measures against the spread of coronavir have been in place since Saturday.
People must wear roaches on internal mass events of over 100 people, they are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited from the present thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have proven to be infected with a new coronary virus has already exceeded the 16 million limit.
It was introduced by the American University of Johns Hopkins, which is following the development of the pandemic globally.
The balance of the victims who died of covid-19 disease is estimated to be 645 thousand.
The most recent million infected have arrived in statistics in just three days; the 15 million threshold fell on 22 July.
In recent days, the United States has had the largest share of rapid case growth in over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected by the authorities.
The infected are now at a record rate.
This week, the World Health Organization announced that from Thursday to Friday, more than 284 thousand new cases have been reported worldwide, which is the highest daily balance from the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top of the world in countries such as the United States, Brazil or India, according to the Reuters agency, but the number of new cases has grown in almost 40 countries worldwide last week.
For example, it concerns Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The plague has already occurred in almost all countries of the world, the first case officially reported today by the KLDR.
The air in the homes is up to five times worse than the outdoors.
Health damage to air fresheners and deodorants
Health is threatening not only poor air quality in rural areas but also at home.
The Israeli expert on human health, Carol Abraham, quoted in The Jerusalem Post, pointed out.
According to Abraham, who was responsible for the establishment of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on household damage right now when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the United States Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than that of the country.
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that poor air quality in its homes kills 3.8 million people every year.
"Because of the coronation epidemic that forced many and still forced to work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of the air in the homes," Abraham said.
In Israel, it says that the quality of "home air" is hardly forgotten.
At the same time, dangerous things can be the things that people usually come into contact with - insects, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides.
"The poisoned gas also throws clothes that we regularly carry into the cleaner," Abraham said.
The most vulnerable are children, older members of the household, and people with breathing problems.
Otherwise, health problems such as headaches, nausea, nose irritation, nose bleeding, vomiting, or skin allergy may begin.
Long-term exposure to non-healthy substances may cause damage to the internal organs and central nervous system.
Not all of the damages come from inside the house, but the material from which the houses are built may also be the source.
