Colonel Rubina Pavel Mogilevec told us about the reasons for the team's failure.
The Kazans in the Russian Championship suffered four successive defeats, as well as the refugees from Cuba.
We're going to play every game, quote Mogilev's News.
Each of us, therefore, needs to consider the causes of such failures.
Further meetings are needed to prepare and correct the situation.
How?
If we had known, we'd probably have made it right.
But first of all, I think we should add something like loneliness.
I think we have a problem with this.

China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the Tibetan Bill
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called "Taibah Bill", which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was stated by the official representative of the Office of the GOC on Thursday, Taiwan, Ma Siaoguan.
The approval of the United States Senate Committee on the International Relations of the Bill is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and a gross interference in the domestic affairs of China, Ma Syaoguan noted.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China and the related issues concern China ' s domestic affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative draft laws, and immediately stop interfering with the Taiwanese issue in order to avoid further damage to Chinese-American relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwanese Gulf,” he said.
China must be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by any and no forces, Mr. Ma. Seoguan stressed.
TikTok hides uncomfortable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18
Image China / Reuters
The Chinese Social Network TikTok is subject to videocensorship, which refers to the area of Tianianmen, the independence of Tibet or the prohibited religious group of Falun Gong, says The Guardian.
The documents published show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is promoting the foreign foreign policy of China through the annex.
Most of the violations related to China's policies are under "inflamed hatred".
In each case, TikTok places unfavourable publications in a context appropriate under general rules so that social networking does not look like censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China is subject to a general ban on “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in the area of Tianyanmen or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “declaration of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also lists from the prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or state actors”, including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Chen Yn, Indian policies of Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barak Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kin Hei, President of Indonesia, Joko Vido, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by the administrators of the tape and may involve blocking the user.
Not too severe violations are the second category: such publications remain on the website but are limited to TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules have become obsolete and no longer apply: "We are now using a localized approach to modernization as well as attracting independent local professionals."
The Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says the co-founder of the "Producer Centre" Ruste Bogdanov.
"Producer Center" is a Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of the "Producer Centre" bloggers agree with the members of the Socset, but the materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov.
To ask whether TikTok could speak of politics or Putin, Bogdanov answered positively and said that he had seen such publications.
With Bogdanov, the founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaripov agreed: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: a shocking content cannot be explained, discriminating statements and so on.”
But under these rules, any content that does not like moderators can be underestimated by Zaripov.
Zaripova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Under the user agreement, only 13-year-olds may use TikTok.
Cossette administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: the nerve analyzes the person and determines the age of the person, says Bogdanov.
If the nervousness decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to the RBK, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 in the territory of WeWork.
The inhabitants of Istanbul told of an earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake caused panic in Turkey's largest city
Last Thursday, 26 September, an earthquake struck Istanbul with a magnitude of 5.9.
34 people have been injured, ten of whom are still in hospitals.
Istanbul Melika admitted that she had a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
It was just in the workplace.
Later it got easier, I went back to business.
But I'm so embarrassed right now!" said the girl to the 360.
"In Istanbul there was a really strong earthquake
I can't go back so far!
But in general, I'm fine." I shared my impressions with the politician J. Ozgul.
The project manager of Selin noted that the mayor of the city kept all the residents in mind, but she said that the city still feels a slight surge in the magnitude of about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the problem of connection immediately after the earthquake.
She reported that she could call her mother, but the Internet was working “well” and she was able to send a message through WhatsApp.
As kp.ru wrote, after the earthquake, all kindergartens and schools were closed where all students were evacuated.
473 buildings were damaged.
The epicenter of powerful underground thrusts was recorded at 68 kilometres west of Istanbul, the Marble Sea.
Matthews met with Toronto leadership.
The attacker of Toronto, Oston Matthews, met with the club's leader.

And I take full responsibility for what has been done.
But everybody's making mistakes.
And the club and I discussed how to deal with the situation.
I don't think anything's been exported in our relationship.
The results of an amputation check on the child’s hand
The child in the Rostov area was amputated by a doctor's mistake, reports the "View" with reference to the website of the local authority of Rostavnadz.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm and then was put on a hip at the Zernograd Hospital.
After some time, the child developed gangrene and was amputated.
As a result of the verification, it was found that there were violations of the timeliness and accuracy of the diagnosis, as well as the standard and the amount of assistance provided.
The verification materials have been transferred to the Russian SSC for the region.
Previously, URA.RU reported that the head of the South Ural hospital had been arrested.
Russians warned of false bank calls
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of phone calls from frauds that replace the bank's phone number.
This is reported by the Merchant with reference to Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided communication operators with information on more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which clients were called by various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a sub-number.
Another 218 numbers were blocked and, in 59 cases, there was a restriction on the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the Department of Information Security, C.B. Artem Sichev, told us that a wide range of Russian banks had been hit by a number change.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank ' s warning about fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such an obligation in the Communications Act.
At the Open Bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank, information on the increase in the number of counterfeit phone numbers was confirmed.
As reported in the Bilaina Press Service, part of the information on the frauds transmitted by the CB was incorrect: the list of numbers actually used by banks for communication with clients.
Their blocking would lead to failures in the organization ' s work.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank was planning to establish a number base for frauds, to which the liaison operator would address every challenge to check the number.
He explained that an amendment to the legislation would be required in order to establish such a basis.

This is reported by Interfax, with reference to Commissioner Vasilia Piscareva.
In the Commission's view, "Meduza", "MBH Media", "The Voice of America", "The Present Time", "Radio Freedom" and "Russian Bi-bi-sy Service".
Google and Facebook were previously reported to have planned verifications.
Piscarev also stated that he would ask the MIDI to decide on further accreditation by Deutsche Welle, in whose publications the Commission found evidence of the justification of extremism.
In September, Roskomnadzor detected political advertising in Google, Facebook and Youtube.
According to the Bureau, this occurred during the Russian elections on 8 September.
The facts of the violations have been referred to the House Commission.
Later on Google stated that the company supported responsible political advertising.
In the opinion of the staff, it is obliged to comply with the laws of the country.
The Facebook company noted that the responsibility for complying with Russia's electoral legislation should be borne by advertisers, not by the site.
The leader of Rosomnadzor Alexander Jarov accused the companies of applying double standards when posting a political advertisement.
Stoltenberg discussed Ukraine's Green Accession to NATO
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, and the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance in the fields of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
This was reported by the gender during a presentation at the Columbia University in New York.
Responding to the question whether the relevant topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had indeed discussed the issue and stressed that in his reply he had not mentioned the time limits for Ukraine ' s entry into NATO.
According to him, any country that wants to join the North Atlantic Alliance is obliged to meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, RT writes.
In Crimea, a Green Alternative course was offered in NATO
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, should be engaged in good neighbourly relations with Russia instead of taking the course of NATO.
On Friday, 27 September, the Co-Chairman of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegrinetz, reported.
"Mr. President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of the predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [the president of the United States] Donald Trump, who he has heard with an acidic person, and establish relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinec told reporters "RIA News".
Chegrenec noted that Zelenski was a good actor but a bad politician for him.
He said that the Ukrainian President would only be able to remain in power if relations with the FP were established.
Prior to 27 September, NATO Gen Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had held a discussion with the Greens on the subject of the country ' s accession to the alliance.
He said that Ukraine was obliged to meet certain conditions.
On 5 June, the Deputy Council of Evgen Balicky said that Ukraine ' s possible entry into the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important to football.
"Barcelona" blackmails Naimara
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian football player, Neimar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the transition to the French Pari San-German.
The case was almost brought before the court, but the Catholics suggested that the game be decided without the intervention of Femida.
Otherwise, they will deny his return.
Neimar and his clever father, who is also a Brazilian agent, focused on the interesting focus: according to an agreement with the Barsa, which the game signed in 2016, he was due to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the Forvard proved to be a record for €222 million.
Nevertheless, he has received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Little by little, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him even more interest for the payment period.
When Naimar's claims became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a complaint.
The Blue Grants claim that the bonus was based on the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club is of the opinion that the game was worth only a quarter of €40 million and that it would require the return of a proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neimar and the Barsa almost agreed to return the “prodigal” game to Catalonia.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope for the return of the foreword remains.
And according to Sports.Ru, referring to the insulators, the club's lawyers told the players that if the issue of financial claims was not dealt with in a pre-trial manner, it would rule out the possibility of the return of Brazil.
Neimar himself is so eager to return that he asked for assurance that the Catholics would buy him back.
Mart Laar: ECRE members will not join the Bank of Estonia
ECRE members have not been and will not be invited to the Council.
The Board of the Bank of Estonia has concluded that the Estonian State is trustworthy.
Until such time as the ECHR members maintain such conduct as they say at first and then think that none of them will be invited to the bank council.
"The President of the Council of the Bank of Estonia cannot make excuses for the statements made by members of the Council," Laar said in an interview with Delfi, transmitting the ERR news portal.
Laar noted, however, that Eesti Pank had been represented by the ECRE at the meetings of the Eesti Pank Council.
The current 7th Board of the Bank of Estonia comprises, in addition to Laara, Lina Tenisson, Kaye Kerem, Urmas Varblane, Kalev Kallo, Yaanus Tamkivi (Party of Reform), Ann Lystra and Rein Minka.
On the proposal of Laar, two members of the Council - Callo and Tennisson - were to be replaced, and Laar proposed Anna Esmaa (Central Party) and Ivari Padara (Social Democratic Party).
At the same time, the Reform Party wanted Andrés Sutto to take the place of Yaanus Tamkivi.
But Laar replied that the purpose of the Reform Party was to have two seats in the Bank of Estonia's council -- in addition to Yaanus Tamkivi's council, Andres Suttu.
On Tuesday, 24 September, Riggikogu rejected Laara ' s proposal to appoint new members of the Bank of Estonia.
In the mid RF, a scandal in Kyrgyz with a show Malahova commented
In MIDI, RF commented on the situation of malnutrition, which caused the regular release of Andrey Malachova's Direct Air programme in Kyrgyzstan, RIA News.
The Russian diplomat had previously been called upon to MID Kyrgyz since the era of transmission.
In MIDI, the republics believe that the leader has allowed incorrect statements about the situation of the citizen of Kyrgyz Islambek Akbarov, who became a party to the DTP, in which Russian Alexander Marugov died.
Malahov said the Kyrgyz citizen could have built an accident.
The DTP took place in Moscow on 8 July.
Marugov got a ride on the bike in a taxi run by Akbarov.
According to the preliminary data, the taxi driver is responsible for the accident.
Malachov himself, who had been apologizing to the citizens of Kyrgyz, said that those words were merely a personal opinion.
As explained in the Russian Diplomacy, MID Kyrgyzia did not provoke Russian diplomats - it was a planned work visit, during which, among other issues, it discussed the statements of the television conductor.
"Andrey Malakhova's point of view is the opinion of the journalist, his personal view of the situation," said the MIDI, saying that the incident does not affect the interstate relations between the RF and the Kyrgyz.

The same was true of Russia, in which there was an excess sugar of 50 copies per kilogram less than in Belarus.

How to increase future pension and not rework
Eligible for pensioning not only the RF Pension Fund but also non-State pension funds.
NPF is a private company, reports "Volgograd truth.ru".

If you are interested in this, first study information about the NPF on the Bank of Russia website.
All funds work under the same rules established by federal laws.
Pension balls can be purchased by law.
The number of missing balls depends on how many years of internship you do not have to retire.
This approach is suitable for those who have worked informally.
In addition, contributions may be made for your relative, for example, for your wife-in-law.
Recommendation for those who think about retirement at the start of their career.
Increased pension payments are received by staff, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the Northern Territories.
In order not to give up on yourself when you are old enough to retire, take care of it in advance.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, deposit money.
The main thing is to constantly increase your financial literacy.

The football player Pavel Mamaev, released last week from the UDA colony, will not return to the Krasnodar Football Club.
The former half-protector of this club may soon sign a contract with the FK "Rostov" - reports the "Championate" portal.
According to the publication, the negotiations between representatives of Rostov and Mamayeva are now in the final stage.
It is assumed that a contract with a 31-year-old footballer will be signed for two years with the possibility of an extension for another season.
Sport-Express writes that the day before, Pavel Mamaev had to undergo medical examinations in Moscow's Dinomia, but the check was not due to an "unspecified situation at the club".
Krasnodar broke the contract with Mamaev last week on the agreement of the parties.
The semi-protector has been playing for the Royal Krasnodar Club since 2014.
With the team he twice won the bronze of the Russian championship.
Previously, Mamayev spoke of Moscow's Torpedo and CSCA.

The man with the samurai sword tried to stay in the garbage cane
The American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested for attempted murder after being beaten by the samurai sword against its opponent in a dispute because of the garbage found in the trash.
The 54-year-old Curtis Miller was buried in a garbage dump outside the empty house.
This was noted by Todd Beavers on the evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black body in the dumps.
Miller saw Bivers find and he was upset.
He thought he could claim to be in the trash, because he started digging in the trash first.
Men started arguing.
Suddenly, Bevers caught up with her and ran away with her to her house.
Then Miller took the sword of the samurai that was found in the same dog and went after the opponent.
He hit Bivers around his house.
Miller grabbed his sword out of his knife and began to wave them towards the corporal predator.
Bivers told Miller that what's happening is being recorded on the video.
Seeing the video camera, Miller ran away, but he threatened to come back.
Bevers left his body in the yard and went home.
Shortly thereafter, he saw that an unknown woman had entered his court and had taken her broom, shouting insults.
The police have already been looking for Miller to drive a car without rights.
He was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardston, New Jersey, the hedgehog manager attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
So he responded that the guests at the wedding that was held at the same hotel where he stopped were not going to let him smoke.
Mass disturbances on three
The Moscow case against the participants in the summer protests continues, and the more fragmented it is and the more political fill is lost.
The evidence of the fact that “mass disorder” itself does not withstand verification, but without a political solution to bring this case down on brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the lifting of the charges.
The collapse of the case must be a source of encouragement to society, but it is likely that it will leave in the extreme indignation of the rapists whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have become empty.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining defendants under article 212 (mass disorder) - Alexei Miniello was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligation, and a few hours later he was fully remanded: the CRC dropped the charges.
The past had been under arrest for nearly two months, and several professional communities — historians, priests, and writers — had immediately joined him.
Thereafter, there were only two indictees in mass riots (formerly 13): Sergey Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajab, whom the court had previously extended his arrest until the end of December (he was also charged with the use of violence against the representative of the authorities, art. 318 C.E.).
The court sentenced the author of the funny petition for Latvia's accession to the United States
The Riga Videmic Court sentenced the author of the funny petition for Latvia ' s accession to the United States of America to Denis Barteck.
It is noted that the man has appointed 80 hours of repair work and one year of testing.
"A healthy sense is not the strongest side of our system," the Barthet Court ruled.
He also added that the usual punishment is less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia ' s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time, signatures were collected on the website on Latvia ' s accession to the Galactic Empire and on the country ' s withdrawal from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
It is noted that in the case of Bartecko, a criminal case was instituted under the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country, “Public appeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.
Until then, in 2016, the author of the Internet petition for Latvia's accession to Russia received half a year's imprisonment.

Russian MVD proposes to punish police abuse on the Internet
The Ministry of the Interior has prepared amendments to the Police Act in order to protect prisoners from the spread of defamatory and degrading information on the Internet.
On Friday, a request for public discussion of the draft law was made on the Federal Portal of Legislative Acts and the draft document itself had not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the dignity and dignity of a police officer from “proliferation into information and communication networks, including the Internet, information of a detrimental nature, including discrediting nature”.
The precise way in which police are supposed to protect themselves from network slander is not specified.
In addition, the explanation in the document indicates that the amendments will be applied “by the way of individualization of the mechanism”, already provided for by the law on the blocking of posts insulting the authorities and the law on penalties for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March of this year.
The final text of the draft law will be published after public discussions and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory note, amendments to the Police Act should enter into force in January 2020.
On 18 March, President Vladimir Putin signed the law on punishment for “evident disrespect towards the State” on the Internet.
According to this document, Rosomnadzor has warned against the violation of the resource and has given it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine of between 30 and 300 thousand rubles and for the second violation is an administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On 12 April, Rosomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslav edition of 76.ru.
Soon thereafter, the Grand District Court of New Town punished the local population for 30 thousand rubles for posting on the network “two misinformed records that insult human dignity and public morality and express a clear disregard for society, the State, the authorities of the State in charge of the RF”.

Will Phytoestrogens and Phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
Phytoandrogen theme studied weakly.
One of the best-known is a coarse dust.
Phytoestrogens have been studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including heart disease, some types of cancer).
Famous sources of phytoestrogens are all bees (popular soybeans alone), cloud, grass seeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot fully replace natural hormones.
The possible damage from such additives cannot be excluded.
For example, at the back of their adoption, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by the presence of too many analogues outside the body.

The Astana Club, which has been called "Dinom", "Celinnik", "Astana" and "Jennis" for several years, was formed in 2014.
Faithfulmen protected his colors in 2004 and 2008.
“I learned about the action to reinstate the Jennis Football Club, organized by its ills.
And he couldn't stay away!
I spent half a season in this club.
It was not the best time for results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal patients who have always been with the team!
It'll always be in the memory and stadium of the name Munaytpas, at which I killed my 200th ball in my career!
"Genis" has to be born!
He's got a great story and a great pain in the ass.
I wish them the best, and I believe that the people of the city will return to them."

The hydrometer called true people's notes
In Russia there are many peoples who are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometre Centre, all the notes that are allegedly working were checked.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted in a short-term cut.
According to Russian Hydrometre Centre scientist Roman Wilfand, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will be truly beautiful, as our ancestors have noted.
And if the sky were to shine bright, it would rain on the next day.
The second working note is based on the observation of birds.
It's more often called a bat if they're flying low, it's usually raining.
This is explained simply by the fact that when the humidity is high, the muscles are rubbed with wings and the feathers are forced down to hunt for insects, TASS writes.
On different continents there are people's notes.
Surka Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on 2 February.
It is thought that this day we must observe a stork coming out of its nest to determine the time of arrival.
On the beaches of north-east Brazil there are unidentified oil wells
The oily Friday of unknown origin was found on 99 beaches in north-eastern Brazil.
Pollutants have been scattered two thousand kilometres of the shoreline.
The reports on the first found oil Fridays began on the second September.
However, every day up to Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out they're all identical, and it's about crude oil.
In the Petrobras State Oil Corporation, which was transferred to the analysis of the samples found, it was stated that they did not conform to the oil obtained from settlements in Brazil.
"It's oily.
It may be discarded from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And it is likely to have reached the ocean," said the Brazilian news portal G1, the trade union coordinator of the oil industry in Pernambuk and Paraiba Roger Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east, environmentalists found nine shells, fully covered with oil.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning contaminated beaches.
As long as the Institute's experts recommend that tourists and local residents go around the oil Friday side and report on all the pollution that has been detected.

At the same time, Mr. Medvedev has commissioned all the above-mentioned agencies, in addition to the Miniusta, to provide proposals for an experiment to limit monitoring activities for organizations of general interest in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and the Kaliningrad region.
By 11 November, the Ministry and the Ministry of Economics had been mandated to introduce to the Government a bill amending the CoAP on the administrative suspension of activities in violation of the requirements of the food organization, which had caused health damage.
In addition, the issue of a gradual transition from 2021 to the establishment of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products to provide a complete healthy diet needs to be addressed.

The business community required the abolition of the existing SanPinny, and Rossubnadzor announced a joint development of new ones.
There were 33 agencies on the list.
In the meantime, by 2021, Rossuposur intends to reduce the number of sanitary regulations and regulations by 40 times.

The Russians have no reason to postpone their pension - B. Matvienko
The speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentin Matwienko, believes that the Russians do not have enough stocks to make full use of the draft law on the guaranteed pension product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal resources in the world is fairly widespread.
The second thing is how timely it is that we have it.
“In my view, a large part of the population now has income from which they simply have nothing to give to increase their pension provision in the future,” said B. Matvienko.
According to the speaker, the Russians cannot understand the arrangements for the formation and assessment of the pension, as “the permanent changes in this area have been completely confused”.
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything in our power to improve the size of pensions and the social security of citizens.
But the steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account national realities," said B. Matvinko, "RIA News".
Chapter FF stressed that if this initiative (the guaranteed pension product bill) is to develop, there must be a number of basic principles, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strong guarantees and the responsibility of the State for safeguarding pension stocks.
The Ministry of Finance announced on 6 September that the draft Act on Guaranteed Pension Product (GSP) had been approved.
Among its main elements is the purely voluntary system of citizens ' accession to the system of collections, the preservation of long-term pension accumulations by citizens by the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, business tax benefits and tax deductions for citizens.

Sony and Disney agree.
The owner of the illustration Getty Images Image caption The news of the care of the favorite superhero from the movie Marvel caused anger among many loyal worshipers
One of the most famous comics heroes, the Spider-Man, will remain in the cinematic Marvel.
Disney and Sony Pictures agreed on their rights to use it in French films.
Sony's press release said that the third part of the "Human Spider" with Tom Holland would be released on screen on July 16, 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on income sharing, so the Human Spider would leave the filmed Marvel.
Sony has the rights to the cinema.
She gave them to the Marvel film rental, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received money from the filmmakers and Disney from the souvenirs and toys.
At some point it was reported that the situation had ceased to exist with Disney, and the company wanted to review the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faygie said he was in the lobby.
Amazingly, the journey of Spider-Man to cinematic Marvel will continue.
"We are all very happy at Marvel Studios that we can continue to work on it.
The spider man is a sign.
It's a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences all over the world," says his press release.
However, Figgy reminded me that Sony is also creating his own movie set, built just around the Spider-Man.
"It happened that he was the only super-forced hero who appeared in various filmmakers.
So, while Sony continues to develop his own happy Speedy, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who was playing the Spider-Man in five films, apparently, commenting on the news, put out in his Instagram account a passage from the movie "Wolk with Wall Street," in which the hero Leonardo di Caprio yells, "I'm not leaving!"
Information on the contradictions between companies appeared in August.
As reported by the media, Disney wanted half a box of Human Spider films, provided that both companies would pay half the cost of painting.
But it didn't set Sony up.
The news of the possible withdrawal of a beloved superhero from the cinematic Marvel provoked anger among many loyal worshipers.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: “We have been working together well over the past four years, and our shared desire to continue to work together has been proportional to the wishes of many fans [the Spider-Man].
We're glad we can move forward together."
The film "The Avengers: Final", the United Human Spider, Tora, Halka and other superheroes Marvel, became the most cassette in the history of the world cinematographer, moving from the first place to the Avatar.

The expert told me why she had to give up the tea in the packages
A group of scientists from the University of McGill, Canada, found that more than ten billion particles of microplastic matter fall into a five-minute cup when the tea is closed.
Packed drinks can also add bottled particles, said the National News expert on food security Elizabeth Tihonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packed tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be indicated on the packaging.
Drinks don't leave at the end of the season, so they can be in tea.
"Moreover, packages don't always include tea plants," Tikhonova said.
She said that it would be better to refrain from using such tea for desserts that are sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packed tea was not only in its composition but also in its production - micro-organisms were heating up to high temperatures, which could lead to harmful substances being removed.
"It's nice to buy pure green or black tea - in such a drink will be the least of the supplements," said the expert.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
As the parliamentary newspaper was known, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy, Andrey Kutepov, addressed a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Max Oreskin, and Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, proposing that he take a position on the initiatives of the Federation's actors to improve legislation on support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy has provided information from the regions on their business development programmes and on the legalization of self-employed people, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SMEs development and submitted proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, there is insufficient communication between regions, leading to a lack of information on regional enterprise development programmes in the country as a whole by the entrepreneurial community in all regions visited by senators,” noted Andrei Kutepo.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the regions for the legalization of self-reliance and consolidated data from the regions with proposals and issues (recorded).
In addition to the profiling ministries, the data from the regions are also sent to the heads of the regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on the positive developments in the regions could provide an incentive for entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such exchange will be to forward the information available to the Economic Policy Committee," said the Senator of the Parliament newspaper.
Useful experience
Today, support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises are being adopted and implemented in many regions.
For example, the Business Support Centre operates in the Volgograd area, which, in addition to financial support measures, helps businessmen to carry out the certification of ready-made products.
A business support system has been developed in the Ivanovo area, which provides for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centres.
In the country of Krasnodar, the opening agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the final budget.
The Centre for Cluster Development operates in the Orlov area.
The Amur area under the federal project “Acceleration of Entrepreneurships of Small and Medium Enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidization of business incubators established on the basis of existing non-state quarking centres through the federal budget.
In a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Loneliness continues to be removed from the shadow
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Archangelian area proposed replacing the term “community” with “undertaking activities”, since this “corresponds most to the content of the public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanov area, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities undertaken by self-employed citizens, including activities relating to the division and repair of housing, tax facilities, physical training.
The Brian region considers it important to strengthen control of poor dairy producers by means of the Mercuria veterinary system.
And in the Kostromian and Magadanian areas, the concept of social entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship support are at stake.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes for support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be development in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes for support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be development in the form of specific bills,” Andrei Kutepov assured.
The airline helped passengers to avoid neighborhoods with crying children
The Japanese Airlines (JAL) air carrier has launched a new function: it is now possible to find out where the young children will be sitting.
Now they can be avoided if they want to be neighbored.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers have been given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and to avoid unwanted neighborhoods with small children.
The air carrier has launched a function that allows the tracking of the places where children will sit.
When choosing the seats in the living room, passengers will be able to see a picture of the head of the child on the ground, who are employed by children from eight days to two years of age.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near the little ones because of the possible inconveniences associated with their crying may be as far away from them as possible.
Internet users using airline services have been shocked by the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the Yusers complained that a few weeks ago, he had fled from New York to Doha, and three crying children were immediately sitting next to him.
Another commenter suggested introducing “travels only for adults”, expressing his willingness to pay for such overflight.
Many tourists have noted that they are now always trying to choose Japan Airlines for their movements because they see nothing pleasant about flying near a crying child in a closed space.

The “sanctions” to Russia have dropped 100 times
The Government of the RF estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to the report sent to President Vladimir Putin, 31 000 tonnes of product were imported from the sanctions countries in the middle of 2019 against 3 million 442.2 thousand tonnes for a similar period of 2013, reports Interfax.
The value of the imported product decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million respectively.
It is the delivery of goods which have not fallen under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, imports of banned products were offset by increased imports from the CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Recall that, at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the time limit for the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs which were prohibited from entering Russia in the context of counter-sanctions.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the rules had been extended for another year from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Originally, the decree on the abolition of sanctions was extended to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein joined the list from 1 January 2016 to Ukraine.
The Putin decree on the destruction of illegal “sanctions” (products falling under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to the West’s anti-Russia sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has authorized the destruction of “sanctionary” food in any legal manner.
As sanctions were maintained in the West, the FP also extended its response measures.
However, the measure is not applicable to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council, President-in-Office of the RF on the development of civil society and human rights, Michael Fedotov, had previously called the destruction of food simply immoral, and he said that this had a negative impact on human development.
Moreover, in early June, Rosusenavár made an initiative to ban the destruction of food products suitable for use.
Thereafter, the Human Rights Council, with President RF, gave a similar recommendation to the Government.
And Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that destroying food was wrong and should consider how to use it for the purpose of assessing quality.
