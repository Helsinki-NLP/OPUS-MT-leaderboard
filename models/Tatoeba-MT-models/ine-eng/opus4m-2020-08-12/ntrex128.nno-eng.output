Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently afraid of a proposal to change the names of members of the Assembly or AM (member of the Assembly) to members of the Wallis Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction was due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Wallisian Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they can be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group was concerned about your «MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp»
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means stupid and "pwp" bass.
A member of the Plaid party said the group "Is not naked" and suggested options.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group had an "open mind" when referring to the name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Wallisian letter w is not expressed differently the English Yorkshire dialect its statement of the letter u.
The National Assembly, which now writes legislative proposals for the introduction of the name change, said: "The final decision on which members of the National Assembly will, of course, be up to the members themselves."
A Welsh official decided from 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals which showed great support for the Assembly to call the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of national assembly members, the delegation of Walesian Members or WMP preferred, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
Members of the National Assembly have come up with other proposals, but the struggle to reach agreement has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main works, to submit the legislative proposal in a few weeks.
The legislative establishment of the reforms includes other changes to the functioning of the delegation, including rules on the disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will be able to vote on their names when they discuss the draft legislation.
Macedonian people's resolution to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the electors shall decide whether to change the name of their country to ‘Nordic Macedonia’.
The People's Resolution was determined to resolve a conflict that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's EU and NATO membership requests.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he was coming to look away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change right and away is the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin stop while the churches in Harlem, New York, struggle
“The old I have spoken to said that in old days there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Adams.
«Today there is no part.»
He said he understood why the barbarians disappeared.
"People are socializing in other ways now," he said.
‘Bars are no longer the substances in the neighborhood that people usually visit.’
When it comes to the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not be as long as the leaders believe, "and before or since they are back where they started."
He allowed churches to be replaced by apartments filled with people who don't care about helping the historic sites in the neighborhood.
‘Most of those who buy shareholdings in these buildings are white,’ he said. ‘and so comes the day when all the churches are closed, because it is not likely that these people who move into the shareholdings will become members of these churches.’
Both churches were built of white juice before Harlem became a black village - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black joker who had preached in the neighborhood moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock hired by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops in 125th street, a chief handcuff in Harlem where the owners were opposed to submission or promotion of the answer.
The building suffered great damage in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson's followers planned to build him up again, they also ordered a new game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor of St. Martin, was proud and called the clock game “the clocks of the poor.”
The expert who played the game in July calls it something else: "A cultural tax" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who made the church easy to play the major game of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a substitute for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has become a complicated narrative of architects and construction workers, some of the additions by the leaders of the playwrights in the church, and others of the episcopal bishop.
The Sakrist, who is the leader of the sock and consists of the leaders of the toy people, wrote to the bishop in July with concerns that the bishop “will ask the sakrist to pay” even though the sakrist was not involved in the bishop’s addition of architects and construction workers.
Some members of the Sock have complained about the lack of openness from the bishop.
13-year-old shark damage under the hummingbirds in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while he drowned after humming in California on the opening day of the hummar season.
She was arrested just before 7:00 in the morning near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had drowned with friends in about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the guy yelled for help.
Hammel said that first he thought only the boy was excited to have caught a hummingbird, before he realized that the boy shouted "Something bit me!
There's something waiting for me!"
"His whole neck was torn off," said Hammel, "that he observed when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone had to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The good was picked up by air ambulance and taken to the Council Hospital for Children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's not sure what kind of shark it was that attacked the guy.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious damage to the body.
The authorities closed access to water from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species in the area, but most are not at risk.
Sainsbury's store chain bets on beauty product
The British Sainsbury's store chain will compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenham's beauty product and offer business services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continuing to grow as the fashion and interior hall goes down, Sainsbury's beauty products will be tested in 11 shops next year, and more shops will be successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said that they should double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer brand Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They will give L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand as in Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own Boutique jewelry series and make most of the products vegan, something that will attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test the room of his perfumes in two of the Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online action and a shift towards buying small quantities of food every day from local retail stores means that large retail chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that shops will look more and more like a supermarket, while shops are trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl low-price shops with several services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has joined the Argos interior chain in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the food hall and so protected the purchase.
The store chain's previous attempt to renew beauty and pharmacy was not a success.
Sainsbury's cooperation with Boots early in the 2000s, but this ended when the parties did not agree on how to share the profits from the pharmacy in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's rare pharmaceutical chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmaceuticals and owned Lloyd's pharmaceutical chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an extended series of leather products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty helms will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special competence to offer beauty services.
Our products are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an attractive destination of beauty that challenges the old way of acting.»
Peter Jones' "breathing" after Holly Willoughby moved out of the deal worth £11 million
The star from the Dragons Den TV program, Peter Jones, is "raving" after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out an agreement with his lifelong mark worth £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote the interior and accessories deira True.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to Gwynet Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host from this morning program, 37, updated on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the stars from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the midst of the development of the new cooperation they want about a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was “sweet” when the Golden Holly attended an effortful meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of Jones’s business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - mean that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and accessories brand True.
Cooperation has been compared to Gwynet Paltrow's Goop brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to tell her not to work with True, while Jones hid Britain to settle down in one of his holiday houses.
One source said: "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and it would last for many decades.
Her decision to move out has surprised all the people involved.
No one touched his own ears on Tuesday, Truely was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.’
Experts believe that dedicated to this Morning Host, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions because of strong investment in product, from pouts to stearin light to clothing and interior, and can cause delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has our close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand True together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Couples holiday together and Jones own 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin who will host his ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We are not commenting on his business."
Mute calls "and we love each other"
He paid tribute to the criticism he came to get from the media to bring a comment to some people could experience as "unpresiding" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his voice as a "new-reader".
‘I haven’t given up anything.’
He commented that Kim was interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the nuclear programme in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear programme have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "response" from the United States regarding North Korea's early retirement.
Instead, he added, the United States continued with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It goes great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a nice relationship."
He added that his work to improve his relationship with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, help in the release of hostages and the return of survival to US soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure when it comes to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump and pointed to the group that stood in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy the island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organisations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of the residents of Lombok had to flee, no one declared a national crisis state, which is necessary for international emergency assistance.
“Unfortunately, they have in many cases been very clear that they do not want international aid, so it is a bit challenging,” said Sumbung.
While Redd Children put together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain that adding with a foreign passport allows them to work in the field.
Sutopo, spokesperson for Indonesia’s National Crisis Agency, said that the authorities are assessing the situation in Palu in order to look into international organisations for the law to provide emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is often subject to earthquakes, the country is not particularly vulnerable to natural forces.
In the Aceh area they have built escape rooms for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more casualties.
Traveling between Indonesian eyes is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship lying in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the collapse of Indonesia's infrastructure during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year it is the choice again.
President Yoko is also being pressured when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have taken advantage of his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands had to flee as Christians and Muslims repeat their struggles in the streets and used machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.

Parliament Statute of Cromwell will be the last victim of the "rewrite of history"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his Puritan followers did during the civil war in the 1600s.
But the Cromwell Association describes Crick’s proposal to remove the statue as “dress” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of the statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The icon class during the English Civil War was Cork ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his forefather, Thomas, centuries ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's outstanding representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 1800s, and is part of the history of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating.»
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: «Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or one is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual whom we knew represented on one side of that divorce.
What he has achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killing and killing Chinese peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, following local media reports.
The man, named Yuan, was found dead, with cut wrist wounds and cover with blood, near a pig belt on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a garden on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He had recently traveled with his fat from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found the fatter his death, and discovered that the door to one of the pigs bins was open.
He said there was a big goose with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilos of pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
'The bones of my fat were bloody and rotten,' said the fat, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him, did not belong to Yuan or his fat.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police gathered evidence on the charge.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Even if it is rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016 a pig went to attack a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and caused serious damage to the man.
Ten years ago a 295 kilos of heavy pig caught a whale farm between itself and a tractor, until his wife frightened the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became one of his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to the CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to the common, but that the taste of blood can carry animals.
"They will only play.
They like to bite a bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
The rest of the hurricane Rosa brings rain to southwestern USA
As foretold in the weather report, the hurricane of Rosa is weakening over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Still, Rosa will take the rain rain to North Mexico and South West America in the next few days.
Rosa had wind strength up to 136 km/h and was an hurricane of category 1 until 05:00 in the Eastern Time Zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane centre was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a low pressure across the Pacific that moves east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa approaches Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to Southwest USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with the low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest in the following days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous rivers and possible landscapes in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to rain between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the South West USA, especially in parts of the South Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of South West USA; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Hazardous flames can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
A warning is given against trips in the desert of foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can make cracks into flaming rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is possible, something that can create small rivers and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain village for the season in the region.
Spreaded tropical rain villages will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain increases late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can testify to intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is becoming colder, but tropical strains will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Many of the Central and Eastern US are expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the North-East USA.
New York City can now reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warning indicates that there is a high chance of temperatures above the average in the Eastern US through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw the testimony to Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. High Court and women who owed him a sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blazey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political debate around the matter continued, with interruptions in the usual TV programs of various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: a unity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI should investigate the debts during the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was full and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, in a sensitive hearing, that he's 100 percent sure it's not her.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the hearing on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company came to this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Speech was not successful from other channels that showed answered, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting lakes looking at from the office.
To put this into perspective, there's a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or Oscar distribution.
Fox News hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also it with most lakes during the day with 5.69 million lakes, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million lakes.
CBS had 3.1 million lakes, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested after the call.
Flake was focused during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared that he is on the Kavanaugh side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants called after him on the way to a hearing with a court committee Friday.
He stood and looked in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants kept him on CNN live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he will tell the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, but so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had spoken, and before he went into the elevator he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The broadcasting agency showed the audience on TV when the court committee would vote for or against the appointment of Kavanaugh to a full Senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do it if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh during the next week, something that the Democrats have also asked for.
Flake was partly defeated after talking to his friend, the democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators later, Flake made a decision.
Flake decided to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not solve for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May owes critics to "play politics" when Brexit is concerned
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May owes critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom, regardless of national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Conference on 29 September 2018.
In addition to the interview with May on the front of Sunday Times, an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is taking place on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their fees is "full of absurdity".
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Diteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for intentional murder, reports the Baton Rouge police in Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, followed a report from the WAFB channel, which is connected to CBS.
After hearing with Simpson, the police said he agreed to have a shot by Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set to $350,000, reports the local Advocate.
The coroner of the East Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday that showed that the cause of death was a bullet in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police thank the state police in Louisiana for their special forces, the state police for their crime lab, the police at Southern University and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being “awaken in the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 backslashes per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was “solved” after Wayde was killed.
"That's something we're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano Explosing Osce over Mexico City
Oske from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Crisis Prevention requests Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after increasing activity in the crater and centre recorded 183 gas and oske emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several vibrations and tremors.
Pictures on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital, as a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Politicians throw in with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the self-defense
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrations of self-defense with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against self-defence one year after the vote on any release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while they threw eggs and powder sheets that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The crash also broke out later on the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists shouted, "Don't forget, don't forgive," while the Protestants protested against their own calls, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor damage after the protests.
The vote is still under pressure in the region and many will still have one year after the 1st October resolution, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which became a fair of separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the choices were self-contained, but there was also low participation among those who were against self-contained and boycotted.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured yesterday after the police tried to prevent the riot and elective clashes occurred in the region.
Groups that were too self-contained sleeping in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of being in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to speak for themselves, but now we are stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties, who are too self-reliant, strive to maintain power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or in custody while waiting for their legal cases to be taken into account in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent stand-alone declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on her phone, said that the conflict was housed by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is increasing more and more,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been part of the ongoing proceedings since last year, declared that he was going to vote in the European Parliament next year.
“To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the withdrawal of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state,” he said.

A brush may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga-School gives Livingston 1-0 matches over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga her first goal for Livingston Winners says
Reputed Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second saying after 18 matches as coaches for the Ibrox Club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to make the difference while Gary Holt's side said match with the hibernian in others.
Gerard's side has no winner in the Scottish Premiership League this season, and will play against Hearts, as they lay eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and Chief Coach Holt still hasn't lost since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone loses odds against the remote layer
Hold his team should have rented long before they scored, and created several problems for Rangers with the direct play says.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had a low effort towards goals, something that made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett his head over the goal.
The home team was naked to let Rangers play ahead of them, well aware that they could create trouble for the team.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers joined a fresh park and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and score from the middle of the penal field.
Before that, Ranger's ball dominated, but he saw that the home defense was solid and the Keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow played far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passions were sent forward and back to the Livingston-Punishment Field, while two sentences--after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hands--were blown away.
Livingstone's Phenomenal 'analysis
BBC Scotland Sin Alasdair Lamont and Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal match and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played a great game and still impresses the curve on top.
Their game and player style have changed slightly since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks go to Holt for the way he has looked at the layer since he became a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organized a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the entire fight.
The ranges were, in contrast, not motivated.
Even as good as they have been under Gerard, they were still not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and cut up only half of the home once, which should make Rangers realize they don't get up anymore.
Erdogan is welcomed to Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky when they met for breakfast on Saturday 29 September in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries disagree on human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevent a population of over 25 000 from gathering in front of the mosque due to ‘safety reasons’, but many of Erdogan’s supporters met to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met up to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state decided to welcome him to the country.
The dubious Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who saw Erdogan as a whole, and others, who saw him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclists died after car collision
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a London car.
The collision came near her crossing at Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road in Deptford in southeastern London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and the ambulance staff arrived quickly, but the man died on the scene.
The collision took her only a few months after another cyclist died when the driver left Children Street, about 1.6 kilometers from today's accident.
The London police reported that they are in the process of identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other drivers have been invited to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six Guards Damage in Rebellion
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security prison for men, says the England Prison Office.
An ongoing riot broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special ‘Tornado’ forces are collected to calm down the riot, involving eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor damage to the face.
One prison guard said: "Special-rate guards must calm down the ongoing rebellion in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate the choice in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to be in prison any longer."
There are more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for damage after a prisoner went into custody.
And in October yesterday special forces had to come to prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners threw billiards on the guards.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flame (for dry land)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is on its way to Arizona early next week, in the rest of the hurricane Rosa moves southwest over the desert and creates fear of flame.
The national weather service has issued alerts against flames on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and east Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the villages Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give the rain already late Monday.
The Phoenix weather service tweets that only “the tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low-pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane that reached 60 kilometres within the Arizona border.»
The latest models from the national hurricane centre report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can be calculated between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the South West Desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with total insulated quantities up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside of flame risk, the Rosa can be a blessing in the dry.
Although flame is a serious concern, this probably means that the area in South-West America is exposed to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, the extreme drought is more than 40 percent of Arizona, which is the next highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First comes the hurricane Rosa to move across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With wind over 135 kilometers an hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers an hour.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and is rushing down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm, Monday afternoon or evening.
There's going to be a lot of calculation in parts of Mexico, something that can increase the risk of flame.
‘The rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a potential for up to 25 centimeters,’ weather.com reported.
Rosa will drag north along Mexico as a tropical storm before he reaches the boundary of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull up through Arizona and enter the South-Utah Tuesday evening.
“The greatest danger to Rosa or the rest of this is a lot of rain in Baja California, North West Sonora, and the American Southwest,” said the national hurricane centre.
This calculation is expected to create life-threatening rivers in the desert and landscapes in the mountain area.
Action in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found the knife in Somerset, England.
Ten-year-old Goddess was found damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, reports Avon and Somerset Police.
The police have asked people who can have mobile recordings of what happened, to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'member' during which 'bad and bad' democrats were against him
“A voice for judges Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unreasonable tactics of the democrats,” said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had a ‘member’ under which ‘bad and sine’ democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness in front of the convention on Thursday, and emotionally refused to blame Christine Blasey Ford for assaulting her sexually for decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her debts during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people had seen how brilliant and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
“A voice to judges Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most skilled lawyers in our time, a lawyer with perfect public service,” he said to a number of followers in West Virginia.
The President also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republican elections in the US.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't stop, but I really stop," he said.
‘That’s why I travel around to fight for good candidates.’
Trump argued that the democrats are outside after ‘opposing and blocking’.
The first important resolution of the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, talking on deadly increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and tsunami bordering the Indonesian island of Sulawesi reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, hit the beach at sunset, and took many people while the evil all they came over.
Tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunami warning came yesterday, there were still people on the beaches who didn’t go at once and who became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson for the crisis relief agency in Indonesia, in Jakarta.
“As if the tsunami wasn’t enough in itself, he took with him cars, wooden trunks, houses; he framed everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climb up into three to avoid tsunamis and survive in that way.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the crisis agency show many damaged buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque of water.
Aftershock continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquake could be marked in the area around, with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s technology testing and testing agency (BPPT) said that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the Hiroshima nuclear bomb during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow wave, can have an increase in the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as «comprehensive» and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the deceased have been found under the rest of the collapse buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and that 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and the size of the destructions may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donghala, communication is cut," Nugroho said.
‘More than 300,000 people live there,’ said the Red Cross, adding that their added and volunteers are on their way to the random areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse," said the Red Cross.
On Saturday, the crisis agency was criticised for not informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the authorities said waves had arrived before the warning period.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building calling desperately to people down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hit the coast, and it took buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video first.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power break and cut the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has launched the process of sending in cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other villages, reporting to the authorities, but the refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
The additions to the World Vision from Donganga have come safely to Palu City and have set up a tent in the backyard of his office. On the way to the city, the total damaged areas passed, said Doseba.
“They told me they saw many damaged houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
While emergency relief organisations are starting their work to help those affected by tsunamis, some have complained that foreign emergency relief workers with crisis management expertise have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations cannot and should be added to start work until Indonesia has declared that the area is a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"There is a crisis at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the state says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open for international emergency assistance, but they haven’t updated the status yet.’
It's the night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, and the friends and family of those who still have no hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday a little good was saved from the clock.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the rest of a collapsed building, where she had been held captive by the dead mother said for two days.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, thirty-two of the missing paragliders from the Asian games that were ending earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man named Mandagi said that some of the prisoners at Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
“As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have an emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon told me that he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had participated in the local beach festival, after he heard that Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one gray hook, instead of two blue hooks.
“I think it means that the messages did not come forward,” he said.
Thieves set $26,750 from a minibank in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday he stole $26,750 from a worker in Brink's company in what he was about to fill up a minibank in Newport, Levee, USA, followed a press release from the Newport police.
The employee had just emptied a minibank in the maintenance area and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "slow up a man behind the worker" and stole a bag of money to deliver.
Witnesses observed several suspects while they escaped from the scene, followed the press release, but the police were unable to determine the number of people involved in the scene.
If anyone has information about anyone involved, they should call the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper renames to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: "The creation was previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came right before he was to act on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled because of "emotional reasons," said the programme host.
In addition to being abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe the word ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means only Ye - to reflect what we do, what we do bad, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also changed the writing style to the name with and without brackets and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would «never use the military to oppress the Mexican people».
On October 2, 1968, the military fired at peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to become involved in criminal offences.
USA should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is working more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research on the subject, win the investor and the user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government expressed their opinion on artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan yesterday, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A duplication of the research budget on artificial intelligence would be a good start, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking forward to the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
A double in funding can double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month via the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director (CEO) of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest ranking player of the Othello game, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognised earlier technology competitions organised by the US state, such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be, so that he would be with and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen research into artificial intelligence.
“I think that doctoral students before artificial intelligence will receive automatic residence permits,” he said.
The Government Council of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s national science federation funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. national science federation and other state organisations’ way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint centre for artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House declared the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no work has been done on legislative proposals on national security and artificial intelligence for several months.
Macedonian people's resolution to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people rose on Sunday in a referendum on whether they should rename the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decade-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement on their territory and has used veto to vote against Macedonia's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has questioned the extent to which the referendum is reaching at least 50 per cent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum is, Are you for NATO and EU membership and in agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth EU and NATO membership. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I am here today to resolve for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding in accordance with the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two thirds of its membership.
The State Elections Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 per cent had voted, in contrast to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
“I’m shouting for my children, we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Minister of State of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dushko, in Strumika, in the referendum in Macedonia to change names and open to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of popular rebellion in front of Parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
State Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 per cent of jobs.
‘I believe that the majority will resolve for the change, of your 80 per cent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO,’ Zaev said after the vote.
He said that a 'yes' result can be interpreted as a 'confirmation of our future'.
A poll last Monday of Macedonia’s Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are coming to participate in popular clothing – something that is below the desired number.
Another measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent came to solve yes.
In order to close the crowdroom, at least 50 per cent of the voice, plus one voice.
If the referendum does not close, it may damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense which led to a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored for 65 minutes.
The Argentine eater received a fit on the central track at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton defense players and reached open ground.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender, before he ran past several others on the edge of Brighton's penal field.
He came past a fit on the left and found Sterling.
The English tip used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit the Brighton Keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the target.
“Aguero still wears his feet,” said the City Coach Pep Guardiola to reporters.
«We talked about how he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did.”
But it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League fight.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He kicked the ball in a beautiful way along the left end of the track to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball while he hired Sterling against the target.
The sky blue tip threw the ball into the target right before it splits out of the path.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play robbers against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals removed from Playoff containment, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer is highly competitive, and hopes to take the “mound” on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to “playoff” for Rockies, who is leading a game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies water at least 5-2 against the National Friday night, but looks like it's about to lock the first division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team that most likely plays at the highest level so far this year.
Who doesn't want to play with such things?"
It is still unclear who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but it may be that Scherzer will be "pitche".
Scherzer, which in this case starts for 34th time, throws a "bulpen session" on Thursday and should normally "pitch" on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump collects voters in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to his first election for the Right of the Right, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of voting for the Republicans in the U.S. interim elections.
«All we have done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't stop, but I'm running all over the place to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're superabundant that they're absolutely going to take back power, you see how flawed they are, how smart they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
“And you can see it based on the last four days,” he said, and he called the democrats “sense and bad and pure and dishonest.”
He referred to Senator and Democrat Diane Feinstein, who had his audience bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Were you the one who played the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant to those who say they're mine.
When the Momentum activists in my local party called to censor me, it wasn't surprising.
I'm the last in a series of Labour MPs that have been told I'm not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it came to how important it was to drive responsible economics, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically probably disagreeed with previous leaders.
At the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said ‘we want to meet to be inclusive and productive’.
In the last eight years my Labour MP has Friday meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like this, and the promise of "smarter" policy has been forgotten for the longest time, if it was followed at all.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each sentence is condemned by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a partisan, when colleagues I used to be politically agreed with the expectation that I should redefine myself and agree on matters I would never agree on - whether it is national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak in public, there's nothing to say about what I say, I always get a hold of social media and people who want me to quit while they're criticising the central policy and saying that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who are facing gender discrimination and racism every day and who are still professional and not out of business.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normal it has become to worry politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerance party that has something for everyone. For every mishap and for every change in the parts, the party becomes smaller and smaller.
I've received a lot of advice in the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "just like me."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I still went to school 32 years ago, it was because I was mad at Thatcher and how the government failed the country.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can doubt what I stand for and which of the current leaders I disagree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country faces a Brexit that will harm private, local businesses and public services, I do not understand why people care about wasting energy asking questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, it is not the only message I have addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the electors in the electoral process, whether they are Labour electors or not: I am proud to serve diving, and I promise that no one can get me to go off or change my policy and prevent me from doing diving in the way that I think is best for everyone.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr goes to top in Scottish rugby
Two of his "tries" may change the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this very entertaining Tenent's Premiership campaign today.
They are now at the top of the ball as the only invincible made of all ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be naked.
“We have been tested in the last fights, and we are still invincible, so I must be naked,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr fortifies roses, they were more handsome than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" in 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a "convert", which put Air in front, but a yellow card from Scotland's captain Rory Hughes from the Warriors' fate Melrose gathered, and Jason Baggot took a "unconverted try."
Climo got a penalty right before the break, he scored and "converted" a solo try to give Air 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the other half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the slender moon by five points.
There was a long break when Ruarid Knott was seriously damaged and put on the bar, and from the restart fauk Ayr forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, such as Climo "converted".
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose tried a "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the penalty statement, score MacPherson a «try».
Climo 'converted' again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's 'box kick' and sent the 'flander' Gregor Henry away from the home team his fifth 'three'.

«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes that the right will open the waterway to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the Marine Headquarters of La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonaselva are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and the obligation to return to it.»
In the landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources in the 1800s.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades while Bolivia waits for the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on 1 October, after five years with an area.
“Bolivia has drive, peace of mind and is united, and of course expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to see the verdict of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court of Justice will support Bolivia's claim, and that, after ten years of negotiations, Chile will give Bolivia a separate way out of the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who strives to be elected next year - has good reason to hope for a positive outcome.
“Now we will return to the Pacific soon,” he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the court is coming to let Bolivia have access to the sea -- and that it would have changed a little even if they had access.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The ruling from the Court of Justice is only six months after the last negotiations, indicating that the case ‘was not complicated,’ said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have been far from bringing up Bolivia's case, they have done the opposite.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,’ Zárate said.
Morales, with his warlike rhetoric, has killed what was that of Chile's goodwill, Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the problem after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s ruling was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given ‘an extraordinary opportunity to open up new relations with Chile’ and a chance to ‘set a line at 139 years of disunity and gain both’, he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime problem to win voices.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to do in order to forget the past.’
North Korea says they won't kill nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to eliminate if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow up on the pledges they made during the meeting in Singapore between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the U.S. foreign minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to start off with his fixed nuclear pendulum, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will be subordinated if the United States continues with sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to take part in any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing it first.
Both Kim and the U.S. president, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
However, many are critical of Pyongyang’s gravity when it comes to construction and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive lead plugs are the last target on the way to a hand-held close to you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have discovered a number of large and special headlines in their SS19 collection.
The highest practical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent the shocking creations their right to the catwalk.
The biggest plague was an obnoxious, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, brake that covered the models its heads.
There was also another oversized fitting under the motesshow, including a jewel-sprayed vasmelon, a magic hat, and even an pineapple--but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also discovered a collection of bizarre masks--just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high couture.
One of the creations looks like dive equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in cookies.
If you like this huge dramatic motto, you can only enjoy yourself.
Moteexperts track that the huge hats come to the room in a hand-held close to you.
The oversized hats come right after La Bomba, the stretch hat with the 60 centimeter wide brake that has been seen on flags from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult-mark behind the highest unpractice hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk--a stretchy beach laundry of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that carried her.
Beach bag, with color of burnt orange and frenzy top with a white leather handle, was the most striking part of Jacques sin La Riviera SS19 collection during fashion fairs in Paris.
Kendis-styler Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the fashion shops next summer – the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt that it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only reinforced by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social measures.
With more than 30 000 lifts across Scotland, these shields, represented by the Scottish Council for Self-Effective Shields (SCISs), work to offer the best services to their high and parents.
Self-embracing schools aim to promote their higher education and higher education, careers and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made pensum, we see that modern languages are a popular choice of languages in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, the message will go to his own heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot only lean on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
By looking at the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is at the top of the league tables with the highest standing characters for self-adhesive shells.
A total of 68 per cent of the elevators that took forward language received A.
The data collected from SCIS' 74 member schools show that 72 per cent of the high scores received A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who took German, 69 per cent of those who took French, and 63 per cent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support language as vital qualities, which children and young people will absolutely need in the future.
The language of choice is considered equivalent to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the mind of self-esteem and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Selection for Additives and Characteristics in 2014 showed that 17% of employers were employed to fill jobs due to a lack of language skills among applicants.
For this reason, language in the school is more and more important in order to prepare youth for work life.
With multiple job opportunities for language experts, these properties are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what kind of career a youth has, if they have learned another language, they have a proper advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically provide a multilingual person with advantages in a competitive world.
Following a YouTube survey of more than 4000 adult British in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Learning more languages, especially those used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to what languages they teach.
Many scholars focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are classified as important in Britain when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between in self-employed schools and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish self-employed shells are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will provide children and give them the qualities they need to close, whatever the future holds.
One cannot deny that in this global business-oriented environment language is vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called ‘international communication properties’.
Self-embracing shells will continue to offer this choice, offering diversity and high competence for Scotland’s young people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is soon for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James debuters at the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season match on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the length of the game has not yet been determined.
“It is coming to be more than one minute and less than 49,” Walton announced on Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweets that James most likely will play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the previous season.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get me ready,” he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned stops next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmatory vote to choose to fill the position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build up support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
How long will Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 19:00 this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump si West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to record this week's hearings of the Supreme Court-designated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about debts of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmatory vote from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the primary objective of this cafe of collections is to help Republicans meet November elections and have some time (driving power).
So President Trump's campaign says that these five meetings next week are aimed at "convening volunteers and supporters who the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the President will travel to as many countries as possible when we enter the busy campaign season," says a speaker for the Trump campaign who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Designed for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening collection can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw cover from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican latent Patrick Morrisey, who is sought in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a promise in terms of terms,” said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows stomach for fighting to keep hope alive on Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions Saturday afternoon could only be foursomes as this Ryder Cup's throne.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport, but one that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the moment is now?
“They had a six-point lease, and now there are four, so we take it as a little moment, I suppose,” said Jordan Spieth when he stepped off for the day.
Europe has, of course, four points leading to 12 more at stake.
The Americans, as Speeth says, know that they have some wind in their sails, and they have much to encourage by, not least the shape of Speeth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has our mortals from tea to green and rents by example.
The guitar screams of the fair were higher when his round continued, sought an important put to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been down two after two.
His suit that won the 15th match was met with a similar scream, the type that tells you that he thinks the American team isn't out of this.
“You have actually just got buried deep and worried about your own fight,” said Spieh.
There are all of these players left now.
18 holes to create a brand.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but sweet couples are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who would not shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also knocked on the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a 18-hole track) on Friday morning.
That course, and the way their energy seems to move both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cements that they are the players to be hit on Sunday, and it would not be more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
At the same time, both in different holes.
Talk about European honor is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning's football hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, dug the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole they never came close to climbing out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the way they don't give, and the way that a strategy can change the eyebrows.
Europe has played better than a team so far and has taken a significant lease in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the guts to the fight that someone, especially Stateside, had hesitated on.
Europe takes 10-6 rents in the Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursome camps with a 10-6 rental across the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to take his fight so far on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side offered to keep the trophy lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a mist American side in tomorrow's fourballs, and took the 3-1 series.
The U.S. provided more resistance in fursomes and won two battles, but they could not get into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's page needs eight points from the 12 single campaigns on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a stunning weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four battles in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they went out so nice to beat a rocked Woods and American smoker Bryson Dechambeau with another five and four.
Woods, who slipped through two camps on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in rows.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to his partners Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka--ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not yet get everything they wanted on a nice, windy day south-west of Paris.
Three times, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 says about Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they lost the two holes in the opening.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history has a layer come back from a four-point base and entered into a single, even if the owner only needs the Furyk side to draw to maintain the trophy.
After having been the next best for two days, it still looks like a Sunday attack will be outside.
North Korea says it's not possible to move down one-sided without trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that if sanctions continued to increase mistrust in the United States and that the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Power that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve the situation in the last year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing site and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t get anything back from the USA, however,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has filed several complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase” approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, showed itself significantly by not rejecting unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a common phrase published by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit sometime between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "the construction of nuclear power on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed talks to facilitate the imposition of international sanctions in North Korea.
‘The United States insists on ‘building of nuclear power first’ and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and they oppose even the ‘declaration of ending peace’, Ri said.
«Trusting that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the sanctions continue, our mistrust will only increase."
Ri mentioned nothing about plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead of three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months, he added: "If the party in this call for the disarmament of nuclear weapons were South Korea, and not the USA, the disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Nevertheless, the tone in Ri’s speech was dramaticly different from yesterday, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the American mainland, after the evil president Trump called Kim a rocketman on suicide missions.
Trump, who yesterday threatened to “total destruction” North Korea, praised Kim for taking steps to disarm it, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to be placed in place for North Korea to disband its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained strongly and without fail until we have the complete, final, verified discharge of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last tour did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that he had made progress, but a few hours later he condemns North Korea to come with "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile city and also a nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate action”.
He said that Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he was seeking, were security guarantees such as Trump promised in Singapore, and had taken steps to normalize Washington's relationship.
Harvard students take the course in getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year has helped all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight against the growing macho culture that goes out to study in caffeine all night long.
One academic found that students at the top university often lack care when it comes to all the basics - how one should take care of itself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his battles in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the affected lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of it came a girl to me, saying, 'Why am I told this now, when I am old?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping--something that surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, roll out for the first time this year, explains what is important for good sleeping habits helps academic and athletic performance, and improves the general enjoyment of theirs.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students had severed their sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, wardrobes, coaches and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleeplessness, as well as how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, invites participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behavior of the elevator at once.
But we think they have the right to know-- just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, let Prof. Czeisler.
The pride culture of daily living still exists, he said and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To ensure that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid going up to weight, since lack of sleep sees the brain in swallowing mode and makes them constantly sweating.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after having our students with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press on to get a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that the elevators should consider setting up an alarm when they are to go to bed and, moreover, when they are to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ coming from electronic displays and LED lighting, which can convert the internal clock to total, leading to difficulty sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets Gerard's men down
Rangers went on a new defeat on the highway when Dolly Menga sent his post to Steven Gerrard's isolated side to a 1–0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking forward to taking the first winner on the faraway side of the 4-1 triumph of St Johnstone in February, but the team to Gary Holt caused only Gerrard his second defeat on 18 matches that he was leading, and gave eight points, a round under Ladbroke's leader of Premier League, Hearts.
Lots of hits to seven minutes before half-time, and a ranger setup with lack of inspiration never seemed to work out.
While Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and only lies behind the Hibernian on target.
And there may be further problems in stock for Rangers after the liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an object appears to have been thrown from the side.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that made Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way that the well-dreamed suit of his took the qualms of his opponents on each shift.
Rangers might have had the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Menga sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor, but the middle-level player failed in his fight.
A far-off park from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far at the return.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morello's knowledge was certain that he would have been punished on the 20-metre mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judge Steven Thomson appealed away to the Colombian.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first half, but earlier Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was hardly concerned about Lassana Coulibaly's head and an empty shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules of the game, no one can deny that they only earned it because of the "shot".
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep deathball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, which seemed fun to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard paused as if he were replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the switch caused an immediate effect when the wing player made a hole for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly race ahead to block.
But Livingstone continued to list the guest layer to play exactly what they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending long shot at the long shot.
Holt's law could have increased the rent said at the end, but McGregor succeeded in preventing Jacobs from doing so, until Lithgrow left a long post from the corner mark.
The ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new requirement for punishment when he supported Jacobs, but again Thomson ignored it.
Almanac: The Founder of the Geiger Counter
And now one page from our Sunday Morning Almaac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE RECOGNIZED ... the day that he became physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific bear tree since then, the Geiger counter was also a bear tree in pop culture, as in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, with the apparently unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it in all the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you look at these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms coming from the radioactivity of minerals.»
Evans: "Yes, don't worry about it."
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old day.
But the inventions that call his name live on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to see red cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to see red cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise red cells as part of the treatment
This method involves removing immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many forms of cancer, and then they reinstate it.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise red cells, experienced that ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, transforming them into the laboratory, so that they can “see” a protein that is common in many forms of cancer, called HER2, and then reinstate the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 «drive the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to withdraw immune cells from patients and "learn" how they target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West started a Pro-Trump Diatribe, introduced a MAGA lue, after he visited the TV show Saturday Night Live.
It didn't work so well.
Kanye West was tipped off at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a tremendous performance in which he praised the United States president, Donald Trump, and said he would put up the election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had on a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a tiring and repeated his support to Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person, and they say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America for a long time, he said.
SNL started the show with a number together with comedian Matt Damon, where Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's legal election on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, it was taken to the West by the comic stripper Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to skip West with the post.
The West had also complained to the public that he had the difficult backstage due to his headache.
«Dei mobba me gran scene.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on.
Get the fuck off me!
And then they say I'm in a low-down place," he said, following Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the lower space?" says he wants to "take on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.
His comments led to eviction at least two times from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed to be deeply concerned, Variety reported, with a person who told the publication: «The whole studio was killed».
West was picked up as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the chief of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as a tweeter: «To one of the most brave spirits: THANK YOU TO BE BROADING UP TO THE PUBLIC.»
But talkshow-vertinna Karen Hunter twitter that West “almost simply was just like him and it’s absolutely fantastic.”
‘But I did NOT choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe to be ambitious and question ideologies that are harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's what we're doing too.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dog has got the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the sword-winding role of Jon Snow in HBO's chosen medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the shooter, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, and says that these roles on the screen often lead young guys to feel that they have to be smart to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thought something had gone wrong and asked how one should deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, as well as 31, admitted that he knew “very strongly” to address the problem.
“Personally, I am overcome by the fact that something has gone wrong with masculinity.” he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He went on: 'What is born and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and in the streets, what makes young guys feel like they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time -- how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones predecessors or followers when the series ended in summer and said he was "completed with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The shooter recently revealed that he was watching the meeting with the woman said Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family and my life ahead,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the winner of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are the framework of the country, saying health supplements.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transmitted through six and marked a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who received HIV this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health personnel said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ persons is claimed to be widespread flowerers.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies have shown that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add leak information from the GOP senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
USA Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had provided personal information about three republican American senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislature.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were pedalised by extreme right wing investigations and websites.
"Lies, lies and more contemptuous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published included informational addresses and phone numbers of the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the charges of sexual assault against the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters 'office and issued the information to a member of the Waters' staff, reported Hill.
‘This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie,’ the Waters continued.
«One of my additions - which has been compromised by their identity, personal information and security as a result of these malicious and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This groundless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.’
From the point of view of Water, there was rapid criticism of the network, among others by former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is crazy,” Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have a temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is blamed for something they didn't do, they don't have to be crazy.
They don't have to be stupid.
They don't have to ask questions on the reason for the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleicher proved to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the democrats of Kavanaugh, who were owed by critics to be apparent to mind during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take over the Waters place in the middle election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
«No matter if it is true», he tweets.
In the questionnaire, Waters said that her office had warned "that the governing powers and the law enforcement units of these false claims should be corrected.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed,’ he continued, ‘and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each of my employees.’
Johnny English beats again - spyball of weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to watch Brexit's remarkable features in all new films with a British angle, and it seems valid for this revitalization of Johnny England's action comedy spof-frenchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the self-vironent satire that deals with how openly we are, become the new export potential in the country?
In any case, the large-eyed, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber handle has for the second time been renewed his permission to fuck things up--his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic book for filmmakers in non-English countries.
He is, of course, the stupid, secret agent who trascises in his bizarre desire to spread a little glamorous has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with a simple melody to the Fire Vaccines, theme during the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, something that left chaos at the back.
There are one or two nice eyebrows in this last JE excursion.
I love Johnny English who approached a helicopter while he was dressed in a suit of armor from the Middle Ages while the rotor leaves hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on the screen, but humor is quite weak and strangely abundant, especially since “serious” film brands such as 007 and Mission IP itself now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor felt as if he was directed towards children instead of adults, and for me, Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's tailless dress in the person in Bean.
The current permanent record is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-intimidating spy web network, which exposes the identities of all agents in the UK, to the horror of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last line of a state minister who is a pumpor and war hero figure who already has a complete breakdown of political populality: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but it is not so much in the script to work with.
Her informant informs her that when each active spy has been owed, she has to get someone who is retired.
And it means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at some elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons about how to work undercover: a couple of nice families here, since English offers a School of Rock type Academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving to an underage job, an over-enthusiastic role where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to get awfully crazy in Hennar's Secret Service is back too fully in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Minister of State is in danger of the charismatic revolution of the billionaire, which claims that he can solve the data problem of the United Kingdom: the alarming Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin to travel by father-like wild game: dressed as servants, they look at a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle on Volta’s light boat; and English releases pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality theme to become acquainted with Volta’s home.
All stops are probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as lovingly and undisciplined as it is, it's quite a lot of children's TV all over.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talents?
The Labour Party refuses to draw up a plan to enable English people to work for a four-day week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work for a four-day week -- but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the company leader will continue to send savings through the AI revolution to workers by giving them an extra Friday.
Then add could enjoy a three-day weekend -- but still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea would "pass" with the economic agenda of the party and plans to increase the benefits for workers.
The change of a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the year shift.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits into the approximate party to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The working party would not be the first to approve such an idea when the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the ambition is not approved by the entire Labour Party for the eyebrows.
A Labour Party spokesman said, 'In four days' work, party politics is not and is not evaluated by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the previous week's work conference to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to withdraw power from ‘faceless directors’ and ‘profiters’ in rich companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in the washhouses cannot fully recover their efforts as a Labour Government could make 'deduct' due to perceived mishap.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in company management and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to add 10 per cent of the equity of private sector enterprises, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, approximately SEK 5000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told the TV program "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could have them change their minds
The FBI investigation of complaints against judges Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of the extent to which the Agency could influence some Republican senators to withdraw the statement.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to redefine themselves.
Kennedy seems to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
'I mean, of course,' said Kennedy.
«I said on my way into the ear, I said, I have spoken with judges Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, ambitious.’
Graham's voice seems still seen in stone.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly refused it," added Graham, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all of her names could not confirm it.
It's 36 years.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosted by the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive picture of stars that perform and an equally impressive mission; to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's grand plenary, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes' performances, but also to increase awareness of the real objective of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert vendors had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary work; send email to a world leader, call a telephone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been at 12 years of age to reach its goal?
Is it the idea to hire people with a free concerted real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, and has participated in and pressed on a number of different goals.
These actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements following their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the safe resources so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs who are obliged to "help children reach their full potential"; promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help end up undernourished in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5000 actions to require Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, they say, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-aparity movements lead us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among some of the actors who perform at the New York Year's event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the fleet as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can “if necessary” because to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, International Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
‘I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to share energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,’ he must have said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to cover it.
“The US has this ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants on the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group that presents itself as the “vote for the energy consumer” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to handling Russia and Iran, and he noted that they are actually the same.
‘The economic solution of Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,’ he said, while showing Russia as a ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been commissioned to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
In this context, officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘admissible’ Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has been followed by Trump making Berlin into Moscow’s ‘catch’.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has withdrawn from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s Leading Industrial Organisation, Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country disturbs our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to stand as president in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would take a "deep look" to stand as the presidential candidate after the middle election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider acting as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said after The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will carefully assess the appointment of the President.’
Warren admitted to President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that he was “in the wrong direction” of this country.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” he said.
Warren has our crash in his criticism of Trump and his high-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday tweet, Warren said "of course we need an FBI inquiry before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters did not believe that it should be nominated in 2020.
51% of the "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand up as a candidate, followed by Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe.
Thirty percent support such a candidate.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with a view to a potential 2020 candidate include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The prayer said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after his turn in September.
He was arrested and assigned to an election event in the world on Monday night
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, makes me relate to other families who are marked by PTSD and some of the wounded with whom our soldiers return,” he told the audience at a collection of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin calls his arrest "the elephant in the room" and says that his son and other war veterans "they come back a little bit changed, they come back to the shepherd, they come back and wonder if respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other militarymen have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was owed for physical choice in the world against a woman, in order to disrupt a report on choice in the world and the storage of a weapon while he was fighting, followed by Dan Bennett, spokesperson for Wasilla Politi Department.
18 countries, D.C. Support for new asylum policies
Eight countries and districts in Colombia support a legal challenge to a new US policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing from re-elected or elected in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-off-right short Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in Grace v. Sessions is appropriate to the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the elected son-in-laws" abused her, but US officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for American asylum, which nations face comprehensive problems with the world's elections.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration laws, which allowed illegal immigrants who fled the world's elections to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
‘The federal law requires that all asylum cases be tried for the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement and such an obstacle to this principle,’ said a friend of the court card.
Advocates further claim in the summary that the policies that deny immigration damage the economy of the United States and that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply needed work".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges no longer provide asylum for victims of refugee abuse and re-elected in June.
‘Assylicity is available to those who have left their country because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political meaning,’ the Sessions said in their policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while dying in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became even more serious.
“It feels very tense,” said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who put her feverish baby son in a evacuation centre in the ruined city, Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances come with bodies.
Pure water is difficult to find.’
Residents have been observed on their way back to their damaged homes, where they search through washed-up property and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who had broken his back and shoulders, lay outside Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were treated without the door due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I believe, “Haris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador owes China to "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper launched a four-page advertisement in an American daily and highlighted the mutual benefits of trading with the United States and China, the US ambassador owes China Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
USA President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China's Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Registry - the state's largest salsavis - after having owed China to try to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November, a debt China refuses for.
Trump's fault that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections, marked out what American ministers told Reuters was a new phase of an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in turn increasing taxes on each other's imports.
China's return rates in the trade war were originally designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, have been said by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
«China», Branstad wrote in a part of the Sunday's Des Moines register, «doubles now the mobbing by running propaganda ads in our own free press».
‘In its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by inserting a paid ad in the Des Moines register,’ Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the abbey down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the different meanings that the Chinese people may have on China’s problematic economic path, given that the media is under the solid thumb of the Chinese Communist Party” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers derogated from the offer to publish" his article, even though he did not say what a newspaper.
The Republicans are leading women's electors to lead the midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns analysts.
As many Republicans are standing-towns and defend the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several charges of sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a backdrop, especially from women, in the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have noted that they already wanted to move forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse Universities Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last eyeblink pressure for an FBI investigation would be enough to silence the Sinte voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday. Washington, DC.
On Friday morning song protestants “November come!” while they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate when the Republicans, who are chairing the Court Committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination track in the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are becoming out of the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it already has our height, it is true.
However, it may become higher, especially among the female voters in the capitals and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who, while not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailedly stated the allegations of sexual abuse directed at the nominees of the occupying Supreme Rights, analysts suggested that a backlog could be followed if the Republicans press forward with the confirmation.
“This has been a confusing root for GOP,” said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It is not only about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,’ Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that is involved in selecting Democrats, pointed out for the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little bit fragmented about who they should believe in in the cold water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little bit more sidetracking with the latter.
A new YouGov opinion shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's press, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford witness to the Senate's Legal Board Committee on the previous week that Kavanaugh totally assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the highest-ranking showed her the sex organs while attending a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to start a new web to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid lets users choose where the data is stored and what information is available to them.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the concept of Inrupt is "world domination".
'We have to do it now,' he said about the start.
«It's a historical eyebrows.»
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or an POD.
It may contain contact lists, memo lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal web store is that it's completely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, following the managing director of John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to all.
The company consists of the eyebrows of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some additional developers with contracts to work with the project, as well as a community of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely upside down over the night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In an article on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web collection.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a vote with great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will become the current founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this next age on the web,” said Berners-Lee ten l.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine Fair
The only Goddess of the English Church who won a Victoria Cross during the first world war as a fighter has been a celebration in the town of his home 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Water won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
Yet he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A monument was taken away by his two children at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic", that the stone would be taken away just 100 years after his grandfather's winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Water led its battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 “through a very thick shoe and under heavy fire from fields and masking weapons.”
He later ran up to the front line, and with the “greatest gallantry” he led the line forward before he left with a field gun and shot out three of the group.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German ski shooter on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were "something I know I could never live to, but something I am proud of."
He and his brother Dr. James Water also left a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honored to play a part in the parade, and added that “the value of a true being is fully shown by the support given by many people.”
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead.
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206 so you can't see the main event.
The San Jose bill included 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just in the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing to meet each other, the sailors in the United Kingdom were again horrified when the roofs changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were a little impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described changing the series of cartoons for children as "a kind of sick joke."
“It is public regulation that at 6 p.m. if the content was not suitable, they had to switch to the children’s programme,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the transfer.
« Peppa-grisen, «yes».
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they should work on planning to include British sailors in the future.
“I think that when I think about replay, I think we can probably figure it out,” said Coker.
«But the hour is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we do not find out this before Sunday our time, their time Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it passed, there were many scriptures that went back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five fights instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we tried to hand it over to the fan, and we just went over.
It's an accident.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew each other 'underage' due to sexuality
The Olympic runner Tom Daley says that in the harvest he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality--but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went on the next school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disks presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about homophiles' rights to give others hope.
He also said becoming a parent made him less concerned with winning OL.
The permanent reporter in the long-term show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months of free time due to illness.
What appeared to be a departure from the Lawyer's first program, Daly said that he knew himself “less than” all others who grew up because “it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.”
He said: "From today, there has been a feeling of knowing less than and knowing different things, if the real things that have given me strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was something, he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallion has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he knew himself lucky to live up without misunderstandings and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said it was to fall in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "suddenly surprise me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he was, yesterday, but he said that the age difference never had a problem.
'When you go through so much in such a young age!'--he went to the first O.L. his 14-year-old and his father's death of cancer three years later--he said it was difficult to find anyone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and disadvantages.
The couple were parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
“If you had asked me yesterday, then deal with everything if I need to win a gold medal,” he said.
«You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he should die and one of the last things he had asked about, was if they had tickets to London 2012--when he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be on the front row," he said.
“I held on to him when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at OL in 2012 and won bronze.
“I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life – to dive in front of a homeboy at an Olympic game where there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the first song of his--Stolt of Heather Small--who had vibrated with him in the construction of the O.L. and still gave him gauze skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Cup fight, but he must turn shape to avoid that it is an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was seen at the bench of Captain Jim Fury in front of Saturday's golf in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, which he has often been for the United States, divide the five times the winner's day between being a cheerleader and working with his game before the range of hope to correct what he's hurting.
Never the most competent long shot. Do not enter the top of your career, the 48-year-old is best hit by a long shot on the hard, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golfer is not exactly hit.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth match Sunday, the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has fought with smoking Tommy Fleetwood to win all four campaigns this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single campaigns, get to a warm start, Mickelson's fight may be crucial.
Fury expressed his trust in his husband, not that he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Furyk.
«He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was playing two fights.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it was, and that's what we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches that are played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights in his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven and a half, even though Furyk said that his proximity to the team had some intangible properties.
“He’s fun, he’s sarcastic, entertaining, likes to keep fun with people and he’s a nice guy to have in the storage room,” he explained.
«I think the younger players had the fun that got around with him too, this week, which was funny to watch.
He contributes much more than just playing.”
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big rent can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant rental on the way into the last few days' singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant journey.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the goal line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141⁄2-131.2.
“You kept reminding yourself that we had a big rent on Valderrama; we had a big rent on Brooklyn, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Bjørn, after seeing Class 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You're going to a full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have scored.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is going to be.
I've been saying all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're so clear about what's on the other side -- the biggest actors in the world."
Glad to see how his players have acted on a rough golf course, let Bjørn say: “I would never take the winner in advance.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow is the individual performance that comes forward, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, you're going to be tested out of your ability as a golfer.
This is the message you need to share with players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjørn, unlike the number Jim Furyk will be looking after his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furik himself has been at both ends of the snow operations in the last few days, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up losing when Europe went off the «Mirakelet in Medina».
‘I remember every fucking word of it,’ he said in reply to be asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had gathered his players on the way in the last day.
«We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you want to start with the fast start you saw on Brooklyn, as you saw on Medina.
When the moment comes to go, put a lot of pressure on the middle fights.
We've set up our line-up corresponding and we've started the gutana in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to hire the game and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the other top half of the arrangements.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I believe it covers the whole way through,” said Bjorn about choosing his singles.
Germany's new warships once again
The latest cargo of the German Navy was to have been ordered in 2014 to replace older warships from the cold wartime, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and emerging costs, reported local media.
The launch of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the leader of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregattans, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-Avisa, who cites a military spokesman.
The vessel was expected to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered back in 2007, come in return for the older Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest fractals for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the warships, which were finally allowed by Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be deduced when entering service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 ferry made headlines yesterday, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for the return were little known, but German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless if they were placed on a combat mission.
Software errors were particularly important when ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a team of about 120 sailors - only half the workforce of older Bremen.
It also showed that the ship is dramaticly overweighted, which reduces performance and limits the fleet's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000 tonnes of ‘Reinland-Pfalz’ are supposed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germans in other world wars.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the cost of the whole project - including human training - becomes a problem.
It has been said that it has reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial €2.2 billion (EUR)
The problems associated with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's fleet is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually ‘has almost ended up on distribution-competent ships’.
The officer said that the problem was over time because old ships had been abandoned, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He regrets that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Stealing Secret Life for Flag Mouse
New research carried out on a property in the highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that finding will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help to correct future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano pipstrelelles and also brown langurans and Daubenton flaggermus at the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be located in important locations around the property to track flag mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS add-ons and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recording will determine the frequency of the flag mouse calls and what kind of species to do.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural advisor to NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat area, natural homes, which is most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work as a purchase of land and how it is best to maintain equal forest areas for bats and other related species.
Flag musculoskeletal populations in Scotland and over the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting sleeping and habitat/bubble losses.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, such as fly-papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks of pet cataracts.
The flag mouse is not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching exchange animals.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to detect errors and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, take-off inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland’s first and only dedicated flagship reserve at Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten flagship species.
Property Manager David Thompson says that ownership is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave, we have a beautiful area for the bat," he said.
«We have old buildings, many vets and all the good habitats.
But it's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so that the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of checking for flags before carrying out maintenance within property, as it is possible that endless destruction of a single bupplass can kill up to 400 women flags and young people, and perhaps eradicate a whole local population.
The flag mouse is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, plague or disturb them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are at risk."
Ronaldo rejects election debts of the lawyer seeking German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has noted the government debt against him as “false news”, and says that people “want to highlight” by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus have been responsible for electing an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, tells his 142 million followers only hours after the debts, that the debts are "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
‘They want to market themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be known to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good, 'let the player laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to investigate Der Spiegel's allegations, which they have called "an illegal reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy," according to Reuters
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for «moral damage in an amount of how serious the breach is, something that is likely to be one of the most serious crimes of personal rights in recent years».
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the room of the player, who claimed that he should have chosen her anal, followed the documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed with "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries to a hospital, but later she was asked about a solution because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was concerned about "being publicly audmished."
The 34-year-old says that she's now trying to change her habit as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to be with Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'ville forever Undo' to lose car manufacturer
The United Kingdom 'repeats the city forever' if it loses its status as world leader before car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was ‘on’ that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-agreement Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars yesterday, with 90% being exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we see a production stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have been afraid to leave the EU without any agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns deal with which car manufacturers win are the risks of supply chains in the event of a non-agreement Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disturbances may occur at the threshold that the industry is losing can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory values at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers' plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success of today, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's agenda.
‘The proof from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.’
Toyota could not say how long production would have been stopped, but in the longer term it warned them that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the United Union Association at the facility, said that his members are more concerned with: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
One spokesperson for the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with his successor lawyer Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against the highest right nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Council Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian electoral mergers, links between Trump and Russia and potential obstacles to the President's justice.
Corvidt Trump will tell the general of the sakadvokat, or not, and thus put Mueller himself in danger, has given nourishment to Washington sled for several months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lead to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to sail up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who has accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, something that delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "There's no date set.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters may disagree with it: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since 10 September.
Verten, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientation was not due to a lack of TV-reporter's game for the gallery, although she said: "I don't disagree with what they do."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press comes to increase.
‘The President holds more press conferences than any president has done before,’ she said right enough without giving proof of the claim. ‘I have seen the speech.’
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it this way, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump is also asking questions when he travels from the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the President to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, where he acted to lead the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Secretary of Health writes about Brexit's fear of workers from the EU at NHS in Scotland
The Secretary of Health has written to EU workers working at NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and a wish for continued Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, who is a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though it is less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to addressing the costs of applications that have determined the status of EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations on withdrawals between the United Kingdom and the EU continue and the expected end of the harvest is approaching.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for everyone to dive.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I have paid for contributions to all the supplements, whatever their nationality.
EU colleagues, and outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health and benefit patients and society.
Scotland is clearly diving home, and we would like to be here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
The linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after having suffered a head injury when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennesseean newspaper.
Chief Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported that the damage occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sidebar and collapsed in a way," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie the oxygen on the sideline before they placed it on a carrier and he took back for further evaluation.
An official spokesperson from Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie had been completely operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details of the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and added that Tennessee State still tries to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes to college the second year, and is in her first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five seizures before he was injured in the Saturday fight, and is now up to 18 in total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The extra income should be used to help the homeless, following the new plans for the conservatives
Determined to neutralise the success of Corbyn by attracting young voters
The increase in document fees will be added to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Statskassa expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year to help them homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who hold very much, with the promise of offering reasonable busts.
The increase in document fees will be added to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and the additional money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of traffic passengers.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on broken number two and rental housing, may be as much as three percent.
Statskassa expects to receive up to £120 million a year.
About 13 per cent of London’s new buildings are purchased by residents outside the UK. This makes prices higher and it becomes more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the bust market.
Many prosperous areas in the country - especially in the capital city - have become ‘spice villages’ because of the large number of foreign buyers most of the time residing in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help several young people buy their first home.
He assigned large construction companies to keep prices up by taking ownership, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to surrender the allowances at reasonable bus locations to fix the 'bus city' of Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of promising proposals for housing reforms, including controlled rentals and the end of unwarranted expulsions.
He wants and advises greater power to build new busts.
May said: "I said yesterday that I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means fixing the damaged bust market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Nevertheless, it is not right to be as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or foreign companies, to buy buses that are too hard-working, British citizens.
Too many people have dreaming of their own busted harbor too far away, and the audacity of being a crossroads is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his ultimate ambition is to be the manager of Scotland at a time.
The Scotch (42) deals with the challenge of revitalizing the club from the north-east. They are provisionally in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after having led St. Mirren back to the Scottish elite series last season.
«I would play for my country as a player.
I got a B-squad, and that's it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
«But I grew up to see Scotland on the Hamden in line with my father, and it has always been something that has brought me back.
It can only come if I succeed as a club manager.’
Ross' predecessor as Sunderland Manager includes Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he doesn't have our worries about getting so many established names in such a big club, since he's previously turned down approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'For now, success for me will be measured in whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they are at home in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get them there, but I probably can only look at myself as successful if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the Hearts Trainer.
He then helped Alloa to get from low to third level, and turned St Mirren, who was about to climb down, into title winners in the next season's championship series.
And Ross says he knows himself more comfortable now than he ever did while he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was enough a road divide," he says about leading Alloa.
«I thought it was true that being a manager would suit me much better than being a player.
It was right-winged out, because I did it well, burned well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to the stress and pressure with the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I have always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It is the most comfortable I have felt in my own body in my adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can take the whole interview at Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Research shows that the perfect hour for a half-liter is 17.30 a.m. on a Saturday
The heat wave of summer has led to an increase in the intensity of intense pubs in the United Kingdom, but also to increase the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July the hall increased by 2.7 per cent in childhood - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 per cent, the statistics show.
Business adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: “The current sun, and the fact that England was in the VM longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubars and just like selling drinks, it greatly improved and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubars like selling food, getting and marking the decline in the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It's like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and just the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had dropped by three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for travel and leisure at RSM, said: “These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to rooming in the outsourcing industry.
There is no surprise that the restaurant industry is still going to collapse. A fall in the hall of 4.8 percent per year will be worse at the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for food-driven operators. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have in August can give a longer-lasting breath.’
The total salt intake across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the distribution of brand goods.

One of the five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide for parents
One of the five children - some as young as 11 - has secret profiles on social media that they hide for parents and teachers shows a study
Study of 20,000 students on continuing reveals an increase in false Insta profiles
This news increases the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the high scores have a 'head' profile they show parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - creates social media profiles that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 elevators on the continuing school revealed a strong increase in “false Insta” profiles – a reference to the image sharing platform Instagram.
News has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the high winnings they have have a sterile 'head' profile they refer to parents, while they have private profiles.
A mother who cheated on the secret page of a 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “elect me”.
The researcher, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) on different schools, found that 40 percent of them between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private users.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is fascinating that so many teenagers are tempted to create places on the web where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Elidh Doyle becomes the voice of athletes in the Scottish Government
Eilid Doyle has been elected to the Management Board for Scottish Freedom as the non-administrative director of the Executive Board’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated peacekeeper in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from its extensive international experience during the last decade.
“Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world’s civil society, and we are sure that the civil rights of Scotland can benefit from its membership,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am eager to act as a voice for practitioners, and I hope I can help and help the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total four OL gold and is now a regular guest at BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter he wrote: "Today is a month since I got hit.
I couldn't go.
The legans said it was only time to tell me if I came to be good again, or to what extent.
It's our exhausting work, but I've been quite good again, learning to go again, and today I'm doing flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Split Internet opinions about breast pump advertising that compares mothers to dairy cows
A breast pump company has split the internet's opinion with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what is described as ‘the world’s first silent, steady breast pump’, the technology company Elvie released a small piece of advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump gives mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-end lable with cows, to a song that includes text like, "Yes, I beg myself, but you don't see any tails" and "If you don't check it, it's not spongy, it's my dolls."
The refurbished goes on to say, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
On the other hand, the advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, has created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it highlights the "shrieking" in the dairy industry.
‘It is very bad to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and fed to produce milk, only that calves are trusted from the days after birth," writes one.
Elvie breast pump is discreet in an amme-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: «Irrespective enough traumatic for both mother and child
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their young?"
Another added: "For a eviction advert."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seemed to be "fixed."
«I think this is a great idea.
I'd have one if I was still a grandmother.
Pumping made me feel like a bitch.
This commercial is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a product of genius," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a daring advertising directed at mothers as pumps (often at work or at the toilet) and feels like cows.
This is not an advertisement that condemns or condemns the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they've all danced with the discreet pump packed into their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women like pumps say they feel like cows.
Elvie-pump is, on the other hand, completely silent, has no pipes or pipes, and its discretion within an amme-BH, something that gives women freedom to move, hold their young ones, and even walk out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: «Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a wave and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk cows, I wish to place searchlights on breast pumping and related challenges, and at the same time demonstrate the endless sense of peace that the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has created headlines.
In the course of moteuka in London, a mother appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move quietly to tents on the border to Texas
The number of children in prison has increased even if monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the strict policy introduced by the Trump administration makes it more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors have their own undocumented immigrants, and they fear that standing up and taking action against a child may threaten their own ability to be in the country.
The risk of this increase in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members are required to submit fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence from the Immigration and Customs Administration of Congress testified and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of equal minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had nothing already on their scrollbar.
‘Approximately 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to persecute these people," said Albence.
As a result of additions to the clay, new rules have now been introduced to deal with children. The rules require that some of them now have to be in court before a month has passed, for 60 days before.
Many will participate through video chats and not in personal encounters, in order to get an immigration verdict.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
Its older children are in custody, it is more likely that they develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to elective rashes or rescue attempts, say they are added to the clay. Reports that have appeared in the last few months say the same.
Speakers say these concerns are greater in large installations such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the facility, it is more likely that a child will miss signs of wear.
They added that moving children to the tent teacher without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or to say hate to friends, can strengthen traumas that many have already experienced.
Syria requests US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is currently at war for eight years.
Moualem, who acts as Minister of State, said that forward forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and ‘will be treated accordingly’.
‘They must withdraw immediately and without any instructions,’ he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight a holy battle all over the Syrian territory" for both terrorist groups and "illegal presence of the future."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and counselling of both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-fighting country.
When it came to refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed "some Western countries" for having "spread irrational fear" about the environment that kept the refugees away.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate return”, he said.
"They create policies outside of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebellion, has created an opportunity to continue to press ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevents a major attack from Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including warriors from the Nursing Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, as "will be eliminated."
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for elections.
Moualem sets out the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee and says that the panel's work should be limited to "to review the articles of the current Constitution" and to warn against disturbances.
Why Trump's coming to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal players are likely to hope, the Presidency is soon to end because of scandals and the rule of law.
No doubt it would be "the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever!"
Currently, there is no sign that the viewers have been bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best, from 1.7 million to four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has played at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are being lured away because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the "Designated Survival" drama, which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy author and author of «Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club», has another theory.
She remembers a trip to the dorse in Boston before the choice in 2016.
The driver said he came to vote on Trump.
Why did he ask?
'Because he makes me sing,' he answered after Scovell.
It's a maintenance value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, history from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families are to be united and healthy to the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes further than being an informed citizen when you find yourself at six o'clock to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort said bomber jacket of strutzselar to $15,000 ("a plague thick of arrogance", said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's disturbing description of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
Personally, I'm never going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Parts of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, daily manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the show that goes with Trump's employees and day-to-day disputes (enter a fight with NFL, Rose Kim Jong-un).

When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and the sun outside his world on the northern coast of Kaui, but he sat in and looked at MSNBC while he picked up CNN.
He did not succeed in turning away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Commission and the future to the Supreme Court hang in a thin thread.
“I remember when we did all these sparrows show before in time and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside flows into the densest choice box
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania, in its 17th district, sees an abundance of money, thanks to the conversion of the districts of Congress, which led to two sitting members fighting at the same seat.
The recently converted urban district of Pittsburgh is being promoted by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb fights against another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative of the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The map was redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January found that the old districts were illegally designed to win the Republicans.
Competition for the 17th district has launched a ceasefire on the financing of the campaigns, between the major parties their money-launderings, the Democratic Congressional Committee and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb was named in Pennsylvania after a brief statement in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania, its 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been heard by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by more than 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a short advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama for partners to throw out the Trump leader group.
The Secretary of State decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Naurut, the spokeswoman of the department, in a statement earlier this month.
However, punishment was assessed only against El Salvador, which was estimated to receive $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties proposed, which included cuts to financial support and targeted restrictions with regard to visas, would be painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials were exposed to a conference on security and economic well-being to follow up a similar collection last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top managers informed them that they wanted the conference to continue and therefore put an end to the evaluation of the El Salvador penalty.
It has now been said that Vice-President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been planned in mid-October, as a signal of the relevance of the administration's meeting, said diplomats.
And the three U.S. broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A speaker for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three American servicemen, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations of the conduct of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an unintelligible analyst who works closely with the administration and spoke during the predominance of anonymity.
History Studies
A waiting for Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller must have turned his attention to the investigation into whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to devise attacks on our choice.
If the Congress were to exchange rulers, Trump would have to stand right in this body, in which he prepares to convince the electors and possibly a jury of his equals.
It is very 'what', and I do not mean to imply that Trump's case is inevitable – either for his opponent in Europe.
It's a choice to take us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid years of bloodbath this led.
The course of history revolves around such a turning point, and democracy's inexhaustible march is accelerated or suspended.
Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks out the justice minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water since this newspaper revealed that yesterday he proposed to escort the president secretly, and speculated in whether he was unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is incorrect.
‘How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or is he accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the election for a congress that keeps Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be faced with a long winter.
But I don't think I'm wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied the country I have my ambassador in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me out of guard to light up the Saturday lights on the table asking for the Swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that it says about the Austrians, after an impressive undecided in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A broken obstacle to the central stage player Graham Dorrans in making his first performance this season before the 2-2 match against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a leapboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31st.
"We went into the fight with confidence that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it towards the end, but everything is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and it was the better team.
On Thursday it will still be a great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight, and they got a good result in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that's happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the gutane is good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a survey by the Nationalwide insurance company said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don’t take the necessary cries to have that conversation,” says National Wide, Holly Snyder, wise president.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not want to make your acquaintance a good time on the highway.
Cooperation with a consultant and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options may be a large part of determining the costs.
Get an economic advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with a cash value to help pay the costs, or that you self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Reject legal campaigns before they start.
Get a health authority in place, so you appoint a person you trust to have insight into your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals are acting in line with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also assess a mandate for your finances.
You should select a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure that your accounts are paid if you do not have the possibility.
Don't forget the little details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please write all of these details in a written plan so you will be ready.
“It’s not just the finances, but who’s the lawyers?” Martin asked.
«What kind of medicines is it?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."
Men shot several times with Air Force in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with a gun in what he was on his way home after a tour of the city.
The 40-year-old victim was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Politicians describe the shooting, which took place around 02.30 local time, as a ‘random action’.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, telling public officials that the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Without the possibility of communicating, auxiliary workers have not received any information from Donghala, an area north of Palu, which was more passionate about the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesiøya. Estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.
The city celebrates its 40-year anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donghala is an area over 300 km north-west of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the tree of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donganga.
Nickel extraction is and is important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, following the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses were destroyed by a tsunami in Dongala.
In 1996, the West Side of Dongala was hit by a tsunami that took the lives of nine people.
Indonesia lies in the Seismic Fire of the Pacific and becomes a framework of earthquakes.
Here are some of the big shells and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast at the Indian Sea, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of major earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A wave of magnitude 6.8 hit south in Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and took the lives of nearly 700 people.
2009: A strike with strength 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have mixed lives.
2010: A quake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands outside of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 metres as a scourge of thousands of villages and took the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A little tremor hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was released this time, but more than 100 lost their lives based on buildings that had been torn apart.
2018: Great earthquake hit the island of Lombok and took the lives of more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
Scared of thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists on the temporary beach.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and target for being elected in the world
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested, aimed at assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska National Police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of being elected in the world, involved in reporting of being elected in the world and opposed to being arrested.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report a crime.
Palin is going to be the custody prison in the Mat-Su-Fish, and he's going to be held against bail $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when he was asked, enter the network.
Palin faces three of Class A abuses, which means he can be imprisoned for up to one year and get $250,000 in fines.
He has also been targeted for a class B offence, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin has been accused of anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was assigned to attack his father, Todd Palin.
Mora, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
Things are up in the air conditioning in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was targeted for attacks in the world, involved in a report by the world and held a weapon while he was pregnant in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed to have hit him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by wind groups after linking her son’s elective conduct to PTSD that stems from the time he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of lives lost
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the next few days.

Federal actors will have a rare death penalty for suspected New York terror
Federal actors in New York will have a death penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, suspected of taking the lives of eight people -- a rare penalty that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) will have used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “by will” and that he “by will” inflicted the serious physical damage, in accordance with a note archived in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may lead to a possible death penalty, as stated in the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 additional points, including eight sights for murder aimed at money-expression, usually used by federal actors in relation to organised crime, and a view for the selection and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded «substantial planning and coverage», the actors said and described how Saipov carried out the attack as «distinct, cruel and repulsive».
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov causes damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, says the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the southern district of New York sentenced to death in one case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life by two double partners, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of hints in the days and months that followed, in accordance with legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was good, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after seeing videos from ISIS on the phone, it is stated.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He has not declared himself guilty at all.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "clearly disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution authority.
“We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accept a declaration of debt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma from the event for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of the Tory Parliament of my Nigel Farage should rent Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilise the People’s Army” today, during a protest at the Tory country meeting.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that politicians had to "feel the pressure" from the Eurosceptics – one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he should hire negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "had us out" now whether Farage was a Brexit minister.
The May challenge facing the pollution of its deep split rows has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, rather than by Tories who want to be in the EU.
The Minister of State is tired of planning the Chequers compromise on the right track after Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Allerte insists that she will press for an agreement with Brussels, despite the step back – and force the Euroscepticians and the Labour Party to choose between its package and 'kaos'.
Bone told Leave Means Leave Group in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He proposed that Farage should give us a fair standing and be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had managed, we would be out now,” he said.
Parliament member from Wellingborough added: ‘I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers’.
To mark their resistance to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be subordinated.
We will make our own promises in our own country."
Bone rejects the claim that people's minds have changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wish to become is completely untrue".
Brexit fights from Tory, Andrea Jenkins, also took part in the march. She told the reporters: "I only say: Minister of State, listen to the people!"

Please, drop the Chequers and turn right after.’

Warren plans to take a careful look at the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take “a close look at the presidential election” after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Democratic from Massachusetts was talking about the future saying under a village meeting in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is calling for a re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but as a member of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He's got our center too much speculation that he might be trying against Trump in 2020.
The events in Holyoke on Saturday were her 36th meeting with voters in a councilhouse since Trump joined.
One participant asked if she had plans to put in the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time for women to take the trip to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and it includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in the shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
The Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in cases where basketball players from Louisiana State University (LSU), Wayde Sims, were shot and killed on Friday.
At 11 a.m. local time, the police announced the arrest of Diteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help to identify a man seen on the video.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching world title after warehouses give say about Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified himself before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the warehouses from Mercedes came to have a great role in the course.
Bottas got a good start in the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in what he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and fate Hamilton came into traffic at the back of the loop, something that should be crucial.
The merchandise ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ported ahead after a little action side-on-side that made the Ferrari driver counterville had to let the inside be free in danger so that he could not defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21-year-old day, on the back row and lay in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the course as he went for a quick finish with the goal of running past Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but did not manage to increase the speed of the last eight rounds while the Raikkon was given fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both the first and the second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein on an election Saturday because of her insistence that she did not leave the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she refers to the Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
In a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the testimony ford had given directly to the Senate Commission, but also commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and lazy and talk rude".
"The strange thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and uncomfortable and speak abusively," he said.
‘When you look at publications and leaks and then say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you think it's a dive?
Diane Feinstein, did you?
Do you think her answer went down... you left the document - "Oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Please wait.
Let's... no, let's not," he added, while he was imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the appeal to Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September--but Feinstein refused to let the leak come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s remarks, I didn’t tell her story,” Feinstein told the committee, following The Hill.
‘She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.’
But her refusal did not fall into good ground with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I say dive, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While he continues to defend the Supreme Court, which has been called for three women's sexual behaviour, the President proposed that the Democrats use the proverbs for their own benefit.
«They are determined to regain power in any way they deem necessary.
You see the bad, the bad, the bad, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president of Mediaite.

Patrick Dwyer score two goals for Giants against Dundee
The stars from Dundee compensated for the loss against Belfast Giants on Friday to win the 5-3 return struggle on Saturday.
Giants received a two-way lease early due to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie paid off before Dwyer sent Giants back to the rental.
Francois Bouchard paid for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secure the winner.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the gutanes to Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the creation of this season, where Giants won the last three campaigns.
The opening to Dwyer came in the fourth minute after an assistant from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford served an assistant to Beauvilier as a double rental four minutes later.
In what was a travel opening period, Sullivan got home teamed up in the game again in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt arranged for the compensation of Cownie in the 16th minute.
Dwyer made sure Giants took the rent into a break when he scored his second goal for the night at the tent of first round.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again made sure that an equation with a radiant target was played after 27 minutes.
Late in the second round, co-operate Cownie and Charles Corcoran to help Nielsen get Dundee's rent for the first time in the fight. He, on the other hand, secures the winner with the fifth goal of the team half-way in the last round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five campaigns, meet Milton Keynes' home in the next match, which is on Friday.
Aeroplanes lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of aircraft escape earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia will be hailed as a whole after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers arrived safely in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, Antonio Gunavan Agung (21) refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even though it turned wild.
He remained to make sure that the plane on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, was taken safely.
Then he jumped down from the control tower when he thought it was crashing.
He later died at the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This is heartbreaking,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid of a number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says that access to the small towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings, many of which we cannot reach," said the bureaucrat Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass graveyard on Sunday.
Emergency assistance comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with several bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
The small shops have become a slave.’
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross strives to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Yoko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country: “I beg everyone to work around the day to do everything they can to help with evacuation.
Are they clear?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Aeroplanet in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now missing man after lagoon pilot
The carrier operating an aeroplane operated in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific reported that a man was missing after stating earlier that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aeroplane before it went down.
Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they don't know where the human passenger is.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and researchers to find the man.
The airline gave no more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boatowners helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been sent to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in stable condition.
It's still unknown what's causing the drive and what's actually her.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers managed to wash through the water, which lifted them up to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it went down.
He said that the flight crew had panic and shouting, and he got a headache that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors in the vicinity, who were working to improve a kai, also saved passengers with a rubber boat they used to transport passengers to the country before the plane landed about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website show that 111 people have died under the control of the PNG-registered airline their flights over the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts make timelines over the night when women were burned alive
The prosecuting power presented all evidence on Saturday during the alleged case of a man assigned to burn a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, his analyst Paul Rowlett, has witnessed for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He prepared for the jury how he put together recordings from mobile phones to find out what she did the night that Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the spokesperson, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett told us that he used location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber's evening he died, in contrast to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis had his cell phone with Chambers at the same time as he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When she asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford his car that night, Sanford said he was "laughing, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their mobile phone bills showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a moment after the death of Chambers, delete Tellis' messages, calls and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
'He has wiped her out of her life,' said Hale.
The defense will finish the case on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the case to go to the jury the same day.

Another black person?!
New York City Children's Passersby tries to force a break after a "racist" text message
A New York Child Passenger seeks a couple to give her a divorce based on discrimination after receiving a wrong text message from a mother who complained that she was "one black person".
The couple refused to be racist and compared the case with 'expression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, mother to two, was disgruntled when she saw that her child's passport had been added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
‘NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, Yet A SMART PERSON,’ Plasco-Faxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending a message to her husband, he sent it to the infant passenger Maurice, twice.
After admitting her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Faxman kicked Maurice's childhood passerby, and said that the former Afro-American child passer had done a bad job, so now she would have someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in a Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for giving her away. She wants $350 a day for six months for her job, even though it was uncontracted, where she would stay with the family.
‘I want to show them that it is not right to do so,’ she told The New York Post on Friday, and added, ‘I know it’s discrimination.’
The couple denied that they were racist, and said that giving Maurice the kick was the only thing they could do after having offended her, of whom they were afraid that she came to take revenge.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've offended look after your children, even if you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
Plasco compared the case to "expression," and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a very difficult situation.
«Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a good thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
While the matter is being handled, the public authorities are quick to judge the couple on social media, criticising them for their progress and logic.
The publishers behind the Padding Books were afraid that people wouldn't like a talking bear, revealing a new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: “It is difficult to see how it was to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know now how successful Paddington was.»
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the velvet teddy bear, would have been optimistic even if the book had been rejected.
As far as Paddington is concerned, as she describes as “a very important member of the family,” she added that her father was proud of the extent of his success.
'He was a pretty quiet man, and he never screamed,' she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you get proud of them yourself if it isn't you who are behind.
I think he saw Paddington succeed that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she land her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in all haste, where doctors work are forgiven for saving her life.
“When she called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn’t think she was coming to manage it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
«So Nad called to say that she had come to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy for you, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be right there.
The doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping was slow on the way out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to turn off.
I just sat there, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't complain or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by family and people.
I really had to keep everything in place."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now concerned about the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"You didn't know anything," he said.
«I have sat with my head bent while the tears fall.»
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy he was."
Grieving women hang patches on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have stuck notes on a bridge in Wales that will inspire and make people who intend to kill themselves to redefine themselves and call the numbers on the notes.
Davis, his son Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his life when he was 18.
‘I don’t want any parents to know themselves as I do every day.’
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said that her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before he died, he ended up at work, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said: “I am still concerned that the brother-in-law may have been affected by Tyler’s death.”
Davis wrote the notes “for people to know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if they are a friend.
Don't sit there alone – you have to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mind.
“He never told me he was sick or depressed or anything,” he said.
‘A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the cellar emotionally on Christmas Day 1, when the children opened their gifts he did not see at the entrances."
He told me that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "There is a big void in our family now.
We're completely ruined.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Board Kavanaugh says the future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI launches the search
“I thought that if we actually got something like what he was asking about – a limited investigation – we might get a little lonely,” Flake said Saturday, and added that he was afraid of the committee “jointly” in the middle of a party lock.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're napping because of the clock.
The mid-term elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans do not do so well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who works in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're coming to the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh is able to gather at least 50 voices in the Senate, and with 50 voices Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give the last voice and confirm it in the right hand.
Number of drop-downs in North Korea under Kim
The number of North Korean desponders to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Association Department, and said it was 1127 runners last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that the stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons for the decline.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement.
Most of the couples from North Korea are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most refugees are via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views dropouts as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back with force.
The relations between North and South Korea – which are still technically at war – have improved in recent months.
This month the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the historic meeting in June between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho USA owes him nothing since then.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot first put down our weapons,” Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical," and says he can't serve in the upper right.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the upper right, " hysterical" and said that he has too much temper to serve in the upper right of the United States.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh " hysterical" in an interview with the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
‘I know that if a woman had acted in that way, she had been called ‘ hysterical,’ said Pelosi about the testimony to Kavanaugh in front of the Senate-judge on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and refused all the allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening talk of Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and yelled at times with a lump in his throat as he told about his family and years of going on.
He criticised the democrats in the committee, calling the attacks against him "gross and a planned attack on his reputation," organised by liberal politicians who felt that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't serve in the upper right, because it shows that he's prejudiced against democrats.
“I think that the way he acted on disqualifications him, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi came with an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to go off if he was elected to the right hand, and if the Democrats achieved a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he can’t serve in the upper right, nor in the right he has now,” he added.
Kavanaugh is the judge of Washington D.C.'s Federal Court of Appeal.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat she is concerned about the potential judgements of Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the matter of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judgement.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he refused to answer questions as to whether he had come to turn certain decisions in the upper right.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, predictable person in the upper right who expects us to say he’s great,” said Pelosi.
And women must turn the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of anger, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were sick," Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high firm position, who said that she was a member when she was sick, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she was, "You think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm crazy."
And then she just keeps going.
I think it was brilliant.
Tears work as a way to get the mind out, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories of a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I was conscious of my mind, and a woman who was older than me took me in her neck – she was a cold layman for whom I had always been alive – and walked me out.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a congresswoman, a democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987 Hart was taken into custody on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could be as quiet as the president himself.
'I didn't really think through it well enough,' she said to me while she was lo, 30 years later.
"It was already seven other candidates who made the election, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone calls the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarves’.
Since the campaign had already been a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would just keep quiet if she could collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
He discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she did not come to vote, however, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and look at the voices instead of delegates, and think of gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
“You were supposed to have a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said as to how the press reacted.
"You should have feared that Kleinex was my chief sponsor.
I think I thought, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
“Ho green”?”
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The opening of the US-China trade war was eye-catching, and while the battle continued, a gap between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
American President Donald Trump shot the first shot this year with taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States will be taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariffs between five and ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
China is allowed to respond to the United States for every shot they take off, and the next largest economy in the world is most likely not to go down with the first.
In order to end Washington, China must do what the United States wants, but to conquer the United States is too flat for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the US press may have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a tight political decision in Washington or Beijing can get both economies going under is more dangerous than people have to admit before,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready to receive refugees who will return voluntarily and ask for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years in war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country are making progress.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism”, he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal areas.
All admissions are now in place for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel in from basic terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond the daily life and bread of life.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million oxygens have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to take action to help rebuild the ruined country.
But he pointed out that they did not come to accept assistance or help with conditions from the country that sponsored the riot.
Europe ensures saying in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 when they beat the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown of that team of Danish captain Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, pulled most of the tournament. He hit the ball in the water from the tea at hall 16, pair 3, and therefore gave the winner to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of the four players who has been given 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was turned off 5–4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the highest rank in the world, remained 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cupar, became the most successful European with 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so, so glad to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He adds the staffing pin to the countryman John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2+1 in a single game on Sunday.
“I know a great pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him,” said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his campaigns in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup up through his career.
A weird statistics from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 large titles and is only disabled by Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. made a lot of finding the fairway throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with golf at a high level throughout the entire tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, said after a disappointing performance from his team. "I'm proud of these gutanas, those fights.
There were periods tomorrow where we made it hot for Europe.
I'm out of my way.
Hate off for Thomas.
He's a standing captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 gutanas and I'm proud to be captain.
One must remove the hat.
I was played round.’
