I could stay with you.
I could have known Tom was really tired.
I counted up to 200.
I cured my stomach with this medicine.
I've been away for an hour.

If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.

If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
If this happens again, let me know.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.

I brought you water.
I grabbed Tom for the elbow.
I'm raising orchids in my glass.
Looks like we're not considering asking Tom.
I guess we both lied.
I guess I just didn't think so.
Looks like we're gonna have to try harder.
Looks like I'm gonna have to wait a little longer.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
I guess I feel a little tired.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
I guess most of them went home.

I prefer the black one.
I'd rather sit down.
I'd have walked alone first.
I'm sure I sound funny.
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
I hit a box in his jaw.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
I underlined the word "Alice" to highlight it.
I suggested it.
I put three coffees of fake sugar in your tea.
I opened my tent.
I quit smoking curses.
I gave up.
I'm raising the goods.
The Iranians were peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like it.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would be really nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd get it.
I said maybe he'll come back.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there something missing?
Last night I saw a ghost.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I saw him right now.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sink in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is it far from Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are the calories compressed?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," the blind man said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston amongst me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Is his aunt eating apples or bananas?
I was right with my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry about them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack.
I need to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should've asked her first.
I should've asked them first.
I should've asked you first.
I was supposed to be more cultural.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you were gonna be here.
I should've refused.
I showed my room.
Is he studying outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Dadbea really very slow today, or do I think?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I got him a skank.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping all the time.
I slept like a slaughter.
I slept in the couch.
I slept on the bus.
I cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I laughed.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible for Tom to do this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this wonderful?
I kind of like it.
It's been spending all day cleaning up the snow.
Is she a cab driver?
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I've lost something strange.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there a word at all?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that enough?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is he paying for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Anybody else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this exactly in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Does anyone sit here?
Is this a free place?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still don't believe Tom's gone.
I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom aware?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom amusing?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom mad at you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You talk to Tom?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I burned the cyber in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
I felt old all of a sudden.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on looking for a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm begging you to step in.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't even catch you burning and you being the last bucket of water.
It's after me every day.
Are you still working on the freezer?
Is your head full of straw?
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my counselors about what items to take.
All that makes sense.
It looks pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
You're for now.
He was doing a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never at all, it could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
You didn't bother me.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That's what disappointed him.
It'd look good.
I don't mind.
It won't improve.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; at least you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like anyone knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm teaching him English.
That's enough.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to do with it.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's cold.
It has nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It's got sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think of him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one like that.
I think I'm real.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he is.
I think I love you.
I think I made myself clear.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible for me to pee.
I think I'll be all right.
I think I should look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French very well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time you left now.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I'm wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's crazy.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's dead.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's beautiful.
I think Tom is cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's tiny.
I think Tom's a cedillac.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's upset.
I think Tom's cute.
I think Tom's smart.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think we better not drink water.
We'd better not get out of this storm.
I think we'll join, too.
I think we're close to the solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough to eat.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should get rid of this yourself.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I meant you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was causing me.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
So we agreed?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd have some time here and talk.
I was thinking of visiting the museum together.
I think you'll have a job to do.
So you didn't want the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
So you don't hate him?
I thought I was tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls that were inferior to you.
So didn't you know how to play the piano?
So you said you knew how to swim?
So you said you wanted to go with us?
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts awfully here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the cap of the bowl up.
It's a multi-phase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
His first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish my job in one day.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't matter.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It's worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
He writes on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
I kind of feel wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It'll be all right.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It'll be all right.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very delicious.
It looks different.
I think it's familiar.
Looks like eggs.
Looks like yesterday I had too much to drink, I don't care, I'm really hungover.
Looks like these two are back together.
Looks like these two are calming down.
Looks like we'll have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
You kicked me out.
I'm worried.
Maybe it's dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It might sound like a suggestion, but the order was.
Maybe he'll come back tonight.
Maybe it seems weird.
Maybe it'll take a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It can come back today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it would be hard to do.
I told you my father died when I was 13 years old.
I told you this was gonna get tough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm out of my mind.
I got back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
You came back two days ago.
It's been going through a lot of trouble.
I tried to explain it to him, but he doesn't.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to make him come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
I'm sincerely complaining about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to secede for you.
I'm trying not to shake myself.
He's getting ready to turn around.
It's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is recommended that you check for any side effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the medicine that you have been prescribed.
It's a children's game.
That's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
We're done.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
Everything's so weird.
It'll be over soon.
It'll be midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to go.
Epten's fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a fake lead.
It's a risk plan.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
It's fast enough to walk.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special reason.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They unplugged him.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's been a week, up and down.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is amazingly hot.
You better not talk that much.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and cheat than to be pessimistic and right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's the new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
Study here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark here.
It's better than that.
They're definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to evaluate his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
Looks like I misjudged him.
Looks like her style.
It seems to me that this is the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's a bad thing to puke.
It's like ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be beastly.
It'll be even colder.
It'll happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's okay.
It's improved.
It's so funny.
It happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot here in hell.
That should be possible.
It shouldn't take us a long time to do this.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
For him it's impossible to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
She's in a good condition.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's just a question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
I decide, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring presents like this.
It's nice to feel that someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big wonder.
It's loud in here.
It's none of your business!
It's not a secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
It didn't happen that way.
Doing so will not be easy without great help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's nothing terrible.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light here to read.
It's not that we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not yet spring.
Don't surprise me.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It doesn't depend on you.
It's not often that someone buys a $1,000 hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
It sounds really loud.
Sounds really good.
Our job is to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
Probably still available.
It's dumb.
Actually, it's very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
Tom can't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a real damage.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's a law!
It's so obvious that we don't need proof.
It's getting dark.
There's still darkness out there.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's still not working.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in the tropical areas eat cooked food like cows.
It's stuck.
His surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best thing I've ever tasted.
It's spider tart.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them on their own.
Epten's strong.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
It doesn't hold on to this heat.
That's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot here.
I don't care.
There's wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water only needs three minutes to call.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're an unexpected red saying.
I turned on the fan and directed it to the wall.
I turned the lamp on.
I turned off the TV.
I turned him down, Tom.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was midnight.
This was an arena day.
It was a great show.
That was all my idea.
You were all right here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an incredible night.
It was a ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
That was an offer I couldn't refuse.
She was a mystery to me that I was spending the night with a smart, spiritual, and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a warm night.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful evening.
Such behavior was childish by his side.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was her.
It was one of them.
It was fun yesterday.
It's been a night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a beautiful gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proved that the pain in dogs is higher than that in cats.
It was so great.
It was pretty funny.
Epten was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was breathing a lot.
It was great.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's stuck on the lock.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was immeasurable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very boring in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Bether.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't help you.
It's good.
It would be very normal for you to be mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I get you an explanation.
I need you urgently.
I've been watching you before.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I had already written everything I needed to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always been helped by someone.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked the cake.
I baked their cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with another.
I turned the whole city around looking for Dom.
I felt a lot worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been reported.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was a jerk.
I've been mindless.
I can't wait to meet him.

We'll see what we can do.
We'll figure it out.
We'll stop by the way.
We'll survive this.
Well, there's an explanation.
Well, that's good.
We'll wait patiently.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
So, what's in the box?
Well, what's the point?
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
Well, you were right.
We've been looking all over for them.
We love beauty.
It could be too late.
We're finally seeing each other, Tom.
We met in mine.
We met last year in Boston.
We met the other day.
Maybe we'll find something.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
We all have to go find Tom.
We must always support our children.
We have to face the facts.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
We can't give up.
We need Tom's help.
We need heroes.

Now we need it.

We packed their bags.
We played basketball in the gym.
We're playing Sunday.
We set up a tent.
We're running out of food.
Up and down we're ready.
Let's get started.
We're all in danger.
We're all pioneers.
We're all safe.
We're all the same.
We need more American slime on Tatobe, under the emergency!
We're a team!
We're home today.
We're avoiding him.
We're together again.
We've been bankrupting.
We're acting childish.
We're undercover.
Mom.
We're paranoid.
We're both from Boston.
We're busy now.
We're investigating the whole area.
We're worried about him.
We're worried about them.
We're done talking.
We're eating apples.
We're squeezing.

We're lucky.
We're glad you're here.
We'll be fine.
We'll find her.
Let's go get them.
We'll have company.
We're here to help.
We're still warming up.
We're haters.
We're leaving Boston.
We're like brothers.
We're looking for them now.
We're looking for them.
We're modeled.
We won't let you die.
We're not free.
We're not bad people, Tom.
We're not criminals.
We're not done.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
We don't hang out.
We won't find them.
We're not invited.
We have not yet escaped the danger.

We don't see.
We're not worried.
We rented a movie.
Aren't you going?
Wasn't he tired?
We're good.
We're old friends.
Let's go to Boston.
We're running out of gas.
No need for a drama.
We're exaggerating.
We're playing on a computer.
We're playing with the computer.
We're pretty good.
We're probably lying.
We're ready to fight.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
We're very angry.
We're really good.
We're really in danger.
We're fine.
We're sorry.
We'll stay.
We're the best.
We're playing with fate.
We're the champions.
Did you have any survivors?
We're Tom's parents.
We're trying to help him.
We'll turn back.
We're very efficient.
We're very happy.
We're wasting time.
We're dependent on work.
Are you scared?
Were you home at ten?
Was it one of them?
We're your neighbors.
Were you honest?
Was he sympathetic?
Did you see?
Were you with anyone?
We wrapped the carpet.
We sat there and waited.
We should ask him.
We should ask them.
We both have to go.
We should do this again sometime.
We should give him some time.
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
We should go home.
We need to help them.
We should let Tom get back to work.
We shouldn't have let her go.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
We need to set up a trap.
We should've bought another bottle of wine.
We should've quit before.
We slept in a tent.
We spent the afternoon fooling ourselves on the beach.
We started talking.
We're on our way.
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
We still need a plan.
We still want to help.
We stole it.
We talked for two hours.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.
We tried to get them to tell us.
We were trying to hide it.
We get that.
We appreciate our customers.
None of us were right.
We've all read that.
We've already cleared it.
We baked them cakes.
We're just getting started.
We're expecting her.
We were looking for them.
We've suffered a lot.
They beat us.
We were trying.
We've been waiting.
We were worried.
We both saw him.
We discussed this.
We did everything we could for her.
We're not expecting a big day tomorrow.

We've met several times.
Only once we've met.

We want more money.
We want to be famous.
We want to hear it.
We want to help him.
We want to help them.
We want to know about them.
We wanted to see him.
We want to see Tom.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
We went to pick up strawberries.
We went to the same church.
We all cheered up for her.
We were all shocked.
We were both busy.
We didn't even have a broken money.
We were just confused.
Then we were eighteen years old.
We'll hang them.
We were arguing.
We were in a hurry.
We're just here in time.
We just got out of here.
We were looking for you.
We didn't fight.
We weren't hungry.
Theirs had a lot more of them than we do.
We were passengers.
We played golf.
We were ready.
We were very close.
You didn't save the bell.
We were so worried.
We were so young then.
We got here first.
We were under attack.
We were worried about you.
We'll have a discussion about the forecast.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.

You're one of us.
You're too proud of a peacock.
You're under oath.
You're squirting.
He came in front of them.
You asked me to help.
You make bread in your ovens.
He won.
You're borrowing books.
You can ask me what you want.
You can ask them yourself.
You can ask Tom.
You can avoid such problems if you have such advice in mind.
She can be trusted.
You can hug me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never catch my mind.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
Now you're allowed to leave, sir.
You can go and stay - whatever you want.

You'll manage.
You can handle this.
You can take mine.
You know how to recognize children's voices without problems.
You can make it easier for yourself.

You can rest.
You can talk later.
You can't beat me.

You can't control me, Tom.
You can't deny that.
You can't deny that.
You can't do what you want.
You can't fire her.
You can't fire him.
Now you can't help us.
You can't just leave the baby.
You can't leave Boston today.
You can't let that happen.
You can't marry Tom.
There's nothing you can prove.
You can't sell it.
You can't sit there.
You can't take that from me.
You can't treat me like this.
You can use my car.
You can use this car.
You can use this pen.
You're getting the data fast.
You're cooking a peanut cake.
You could be wrong.
You could have refused.
You'd be a great mother.
Better ask them first.
To find them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do that.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You'd do the same for me.
You've done a bad job.
You did a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
Didn't you know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, right?
You already did that.
He did all he could.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even want fish.
You're getting hurt, right?
Don't you have a key?
You don't know how long you've got.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
You know my dick.
You don't know anything.
Dream you know.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You shouldn't be here for this.
You don't have to go.
There's no need to panic.
You don't have to wear anything disgusting.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do anything to remind them that you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You have a right to a phone call.
You go get Tom and get back.
You hit one.
You're wrong, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair's broken.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job.
You're biting your conscience, aren't you?
You have a habit I don't like.
You have little breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You were a great mentor to me.
You were busy.
You've got a very kind eye.
You have many different kinds of people here.
I respect you.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
You haven't seen one like that, have you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
You have a really good manuscript.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a gift.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You need to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You need to sit down.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
You can't lose your condition.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very nice lips.
You've got a lot of hairy eyes.
You heard exactly.
He just got back from vacation.
You almost missed him.
You almost missed Tom.
You don't get involved in this.
Children, you stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know that he would do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you seem.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you should hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're learning fast.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom escape.
You love your life, don't you?
You'll be all right.
You're gonna get confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be known in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
You'll be better.
You'll get them back.
They'll make you brute.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You're gonna go with me and the point!
That's what you're gonna have to ask.
You'll have to learn better next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a map to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never take you to that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when it's time.
It looked beautiful.
You look familiar to me.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look really good.
What's wrong?
You look imaginary.
You look pretty, Tom.
You've earned something.
You gave me a word.
You're bothering me.
Maybe you'll need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad to slow down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
I'm sure it's very easy for you.
You must have jumped.
You must be very proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show yourself first.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You have to protect the child.
You can't give up.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
You have to learn valuable.
You need a friend.
You need a good woman.
You should buy some sugar.
You should do it somewhere else.
You should make him listen.
You need to grow up and grow up a little bit.
You need to help her.
You need to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You should make this work.
You don't have to ask why.
He didn't give them a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You should make a habit of brushing your teeth every meal.
You should go to a dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You're paying me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a fraud.
He's gone red.
He was running as fast as he could.
You're burning your car.
You're burning your car.
Your complaints have upset me.
Your crimes have defiled your ancestors' graves.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are tempting, but we're all set.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real man.
You're acting weird.
You're a brute.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.
You're all cowards.
You're all the same.
You really do.
But he's been cheating on her.
You really need a psychiatrist.
You really should have let me call a cab.
You're always tired.
You're a moron.
You're nobody and nothing.
You're a pig.
You're a prisoner.
You're a racist.
You're such a jerk.
You're the smart guy.
You're a smart man.
You're a wise man.
You're mean.

You're disgusting.
You're unorganized.
You're mean and rejected.
You're experienced.
You're right.
You're beautiful.
You're free.
You're a faggot.

You don't tell me.
You're impressive.
Now you're in charge.
You're in power.
You're incapacitated.
You're very influential.
You took my place.
You're not in any danger.
You're interesting.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
Something's weakened for me.
You're lucky I didn't delay you.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me, I can know.
You're great.
You're alarming Tom.
You're my neighbor.
You're not my friend.
You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
Now you can go.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You don't have any alcohol anymore.
You've got too much work to do.
You're specific.
You're part of our team.
You're a pessimist.
You're poor.
You're predictable.
You're a narrow town.
You're totally safe.
You're really nice.
You're gonna be okay.
You're so lucky.
You're laughing.
You're funny.
You're uncultural.
You're upset!
I'm attracted to you so much.
You're very dramatic.
You're very helpful.
You're so passionate.
How negative you are.
You're a little rude.
You're kind of rude.
What's going on?
You're so talented.
You're stronger than Tom.
You're such a drummer.
What a pig you are.
You need to help them.
You're scaring me.
You're terrible.
You're the only one who can laugh at me.
You're the only one who's ever met Tom.
You're the owner.
You're the prisoner.

You can wait here.
You're between friends.
You're with Tom, right?
You misjudged her.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're lying, Tom.
The witches seem strange to you.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You're too tight when you shake hands.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
It's good to remember.
Your moon's coming back.
Your mother put the collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is hard.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your excuse is right up and down.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
Your faith is bad.
Your role here is so important.
Your police are full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
You're all here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent has been unlocked.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call whenever.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you'd text me a quarterback, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
Looks like you already know the answer.
You look like you're studying.
You've got an infection.
I guess it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You should ask for their help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Make sure you don't overdo it.
You should be happy for them.
You should be proud.
You should eat less red meat.
You need to eat more.
You should feel flattered.
You should sleep well.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.
You should go help him.

You only got 65.
You should try it.
You should try this.
You should try to write respectfully.
You should have asked her first.
You should wear a helmet while you drive a motorcycle.
You should write a letter of gratitude to Tom.
You smell like shit.
You sound like you're relieved.
You sound very safe.
You've got your eyelids.
You're beautiful.
You really talk a lot.
You're talking too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are very sweet together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're back.
They drank you.
You've had a car accident, but you're gonna be fine.
You've been thanking us.
It was of great benefit to us.
You're right from the start.
You made white again!
You bought Mary something.
You beat me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
She's going through it!
You've got a rash.
You're overwhelmed with worry enough.
You got me wrong.
I promise.
Now you do, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
He's been hit by Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been delaying this for too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky they survived the attack.
You're wrong.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom was right.
He drove fast.
He was great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the picture.
You'll do as I command.
You'll find your toys and books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You're getting too shaky about him.
You wouldn't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
