Members of the Mahjelis (AM) Welsh are worried when they 'seem like doll muppets'.
There is concern among some AMs about a suggestion that their names should be changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/ Member of Parliament Welsh).
This was due to a plan to change the name of Majelis to Welsh Parliament.
The AMs all over the political spectrum are worried if it can cause anxiety.
An AM working party said that the group was interested, "It was called with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the staff said that his group was one union, feeling "uneasy" and had proposed some alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group "open-minded" about the name change, but he estimated that this was a shortcut from MWP's shortcut to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is spoken as your letter in English Yorkshire.
The current Majelis Commission has set up laws to introduce the name change, saying, "The final decision on any explanation of what the AM is about is certainly a problem for the members themselves."
The decision of the Prince of Wales in 2017 gave Majelis Wales the power to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a known proposal to obtain broad support for the designation of mayor as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of AMs, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Members of Parliament Welsh), but MWP options get the most support for public consultation.
The AM seems to have suggested alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could remove the leader, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the bill of change in a few weeks' time.
These reform laws will include changes -- other changes to the way in which they work, including the rules of disqualification for AMs and the committee system plans.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss laws.
The Macedonian people went to give a vote in the referendum on the change of the country's name
The voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia."
The callous question was made in an effort to settle a dispute for a decade with a Greek neighbouring country, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north shows a confession to its territory and has repeatedly rejected the European Union and NATO bids.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote to change his name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's long-haired lunatics when the churches in Harlem have trouble
"Historically, the parents I'm talking about say there's a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, no one."
He said that he was missing all the bars could be included.
"People socialize in another way" right now, he said.
"But it's no longer a community guest room around where people visit it regularly."
Similarly with the church, he was concerned that the asset sales money would not last long as expected by the leaders, "and they will return soon or late from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by an apartment building with a condominium filled with people who won't help keep the holy places around him.
"The majority of people who buy condominium in these buildings are white," he said, "and that's why they're going to speed up the day when these churches are closed together because they're not likely to move into the condominium to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by a white community before Harlem became the metropolis of the Black Metropolitan Community in 1870, about a decade later.
The White Methodis were originally moved in the 1930s.
The black section of the area that had been worshipped had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black mob under the leadership of Prince John Howard, who led a red-hot boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to work or promote black people.
The 1939 fires left the building heavy, but when the people of the royal court planned to rebuild the tower, they built towers.
Princess David Johnson, the son of Princess Johnson and his replacement in St. Martin with pride called the tower bell as "the poor people's bells"
One expert who sounded the tower bell in July gave him another call: "A cultural treasure" and "an unchanging historical instrument."
One expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world played by black music, Dionysius A. Lind, who played the largest tower bell in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin in the last few months is a complicated architectural and contractor story, some taken by public church leaders, and others taken by the bishop's bishop.
The Western Party - the governing body of the bishops, formed by the leaders of the public - wrote a letter to the bishops in July with concern that the bishops "will strive to bear the costs" on the Western side, although the vestry is not involved in the civilisation of the architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners have reduced the transparency of the bishops.
Hiu hurt teenagers 13 years old in a lobbying in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he drowned to capture a lobby in California at the opening of a lobbying season, hit an officer.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had drowned with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then snuck in group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a hint of joy after he caught up with the Lobster, but then he "saw" that the boy shouted, "I was bitten!
I'm biting!'
All the bones are broken," Hammel said he realized when he had the child.
And I cried unto all the people, saying, There is a little water in the midst of the well.
The boy was taken to the Son’s Hospital in San Diego, where he was treated in a crisis.
The species of shark that is responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles of the Coast Guard said in a media conference that a shark had appeared in the area a week before, but it was classified as harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries on his upper body.
Officers have closed access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security.
Giles realized that there were more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sciencebury has broken up the British beauty market
Sciencebury took over Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams with a kiosk-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kyos-kya-kya-kya-kya-kya-kya-kya-kya-ya-kya-kya-kya-kya-kya-ya-ya-ya-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-
As part of a substantial incentive to the UK beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow during the sale of fashion products and household appliances down, the larger beauty kiosks will be tested on 11 stores throughout the country and will develop into more stores next year if this is proved successful.
Investment in the beauty sector is a hunting grounds for supermarkets to benefit from ever-used racks as TV stations, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sciencebury said that it would represent the greatest supply of beauty to reach 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The brand range currently started from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the brand area as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its store chain so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans - something that young explorers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfumers will test concessions at two sciencebury stores, the first opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Online shopping and purchasing daily food needs in small numbers in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to inspire people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive head of Sciencebury, has said that soon will be more and more like Mall when the supermarket chain tries to fight the return of settlers like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more services.
Sciencebury has put Argos' move on hundreds of stores and has also introduced some Habitat's move since they bought the two prizes two years ago, which he says has supported daily food sales and made more profitable accusations.
The previous supermarket effort to renovate the beauty department and pharmacy ended up failing.
Sciencebury tested the breaking effort with Boots in early 2000, but the same work ended after there was a dispute about how to share the benefits of the chemical store in the supermarket.
The new strategy came after Sciencebury sold 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Farms, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was announced that Lloyds would play a role in the article, adding a variety of excellent skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sciencebury, said: "We have changed our appearance and nuances on beauty kiosks to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also made investments with trained colleagues who would be willing to offer advice.
Our brand range is designed to suit all our needs, environments and comfortable locations.
Peter Jones 'slow' after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a $11 million worth of deal
Star Dragons Den, Peter Jones went 'in anger' after the TV show Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a life-style business deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to run the trademarks of their houseware and their accessories, True.
This couple's business is compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwynet Paltrow.
Manager of this morning's show, 37 years old, used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons star" Den, Pete Jones is angry with being attracted to the last few moments, from the lifestyle-labelled business of those who benefit -- to focus on his larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source states that Jones was so "slow" when the golden girl admitted during the meeting on Tuesday at the office of his government in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new deal -- worth up to £1.5 million -- meant he no longer had enough time to serve himself on their houseware and their accessories, True.
Their business has been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwynet Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's wealth by £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he left True, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says, "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be its long-term future, which would make it last for a few decades to come.
His decision to turn his back on Jehovah must have caused a great deal of confusion.
No one can believe what happened on that Tuesday, really close to launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell."
The experts believe that the movement of this morning, which is one of Britain's most expensive stars, can harm the company up to millions of dollars as a result of a large investment in product form, from pillows and candles to clothing and household furnishing, and there is a potential for further launch.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby set up True with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined as head in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent of the stock on Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the leading ambassador for the M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity event.
A reporter close to Jones said last night, "We won't be commenting on this business relationship."
Speaking seriously 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he'd get from the news media because he made a comment that some people thought was "unpresiding" and had been very positive towards North Korean leaders.
Why would President Trump surrender so much?
Trump said with the noise of his "newsman" joke.
"I don't give up anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting the second time after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for the discovery of North Korea.
But the negotiation of denuclearization has stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders on Saturday's UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see any "response" from the United States towards the early armsfighting movement in North Korea.
On the contrary, he noted that the United States continued to impose sanctions for maintaining pressure.
Trump looks more optimistic in the range of his speech.
"We're doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing Kim’s relationship had resulted in a positive outcome — stopping rocket attempts, helping to free hostages, and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defends his unfathomable approach to talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easier to be president, but rather than having 10,000 people outside who try to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd that was right in front of him.
Tsunami Indonesia and the Disaster Destroyed an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non - government organizations have been told that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, there was no national declaration of disaster, as a precondition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so this is somewhat challenging," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save The Children are setting up a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Father Sutopo, a spokesperson for the national disaster relief body, said that the Indonesian office was looking into the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute.
In view of the earth’s continued expansion in Indonesia, the country is not yet ready to face natural wrath.
While the tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on the other shores.
There is no tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning of danger has been reported, there is likely to have been a major contribution to the survival of the victims.
At the best of times, the journey between many islands of Indonesia is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
It would take at least three days to reach a new location.
President Joko Widodo has created broken Indonesia's infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of highways and railways.
However, the lack of funds disrupted Father Joko’s rule as he faced his choice of a return year later.
Father Yoko also faced pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when the groups of Muslims and Christians fought in the streets, using guns, guns, and arrows, and other hard weapons.
Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge inserts goal balance against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat against Chelsea at the Premier League with one score in a minute at 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside the Chelsea gang when his team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before he threw it away.
The ball hovered high on the ladder when the ball turned to the right corner of the grid.
The ball finally fell through the head of the skipper and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just make an effort."
Chelsea led by score 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian andanan player Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blue attacker gave the bait back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before turning around the middle line and running fast to the center of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave the bait and ran in the middle line.
He then made a perfect break, leading Hazard to the ladder.
Hazard managed to get through the enemy again and toss the ball into the narrow corner with his left leg hanging, tossed through the Liverpool Cup of Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights with Naples in the funeral of the League of Champions at 3 p.m. on Wednesday morning at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.

Victims of Indonesia's tsunami increased to 832
The victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have grown to 832, striking the country’s emergency agencies on Sunday morning.
Many people have been reported trapped in ruins of buildings that were destroyed by a 7.5 - scale Richter earthquake that hit Friday and triggered a 20 - foot [20 - foot] wave, says Sutopo Purwo, a spokesperson for the media at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with ruins.
Police arrested a man, 32 years old, on suspicion of murder after a woman was beaten to death.
Murder investigation has been conducted after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at Grayson Mews, John's Street, at 7:55 a.m. with several stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was detained for murder.
The police have asked people around to see or hear something to come in.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "Research is still at an early stage, but I'm asking everyone around John's street at Birkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious about contacting us.
I also cheered everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on the port camera to contact us because they might have important information to investigate us.
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is the local inhabitants of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Research is still taking place, as the police have said, and they are in the process of telling their immediate relatives about the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just returned to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
That man can't say anything when he finds out what's going on.
Currently, citizens are being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer heard someone say that all areas are now being treated as a place of business.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He's always saying, "this is terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two vans were in line and the others were out.
A number of officers stand in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone who has information requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers on number 0800 555 111 by typing log 247 on September 30.
The image of the Cromwell Parliament is the last monument to be rewritten in history.
The expulsion will be a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban against many of the British cultural and religious artifacts made by the fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society describes Mr. Crick's advice as "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell's Society, said: "This cannot be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of statues, that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster's palace will be targeted.
The British brother-in-law's iconoclass is neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong descendant of Cromwell would have been sacrificed to his forefather Thomas in the first century C.E.
The extraordinary representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is still worthy of observance.
Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many people, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressure, in the case of course the government.
Whether it is an entirely accurate representation, still subject to a controversial historical debate.
which is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the next nation's development, and Cromwell is a person who can be known as the individual representing one side of that difference.
And it is due to Him that He is the Lord of all Being, the All-Seer."
Killer Pigs Hunting Chinese Farmers to the Far East
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a Chinese market in the south, according to local media reports.
A man, identified only by his brand name "Yuan", was found to die with a broken artery, bleeding near a pig market in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the door of the pighouse nearby had opened.
He said that in the pighouse there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Scientific research confirms that the pig’s weight of 550 pounds has persecuted the farmer until death, according to the report.
"My cousin is bleeding and destroyed," said the cousin known as "Wu," as suggested by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera records show that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent anyone from attacking, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are reported to be undermining compensation for his death.
Although rarely, the cases of a pig attack on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, and the injured man was injured.
10 years ago, a pig weighed 650 pounds to the tractor to scare the wife and drive the animal out.
After a farmer Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually non-aggressive but blood flavors can act as "miracle".
"They're just playing games.
They're bitten, so eager to know... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give her enough respect," she said
The rest of Rosa's storms led to their expansion to the west of the United States.
It is estimated that the pink storm is weakened when it moves above the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa will cause torrential rains throughout the region of northern Mexico and western United States a few days later.
Rosa has a wind speed of 85 mph, Category 1 storm starts at five o'clock in the morning. Day Weektime East, located 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa probably moved north on Sunday.
In the meantime, Palung began to be formed above the Pacific Ocean and moved east, toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches in part of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical heat that interacts with the nearby peaks will produce abundant rains in the west of the spirit for a few days to come.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous floods, floods, and the possibility of longsorous land in the desert.
The low tropical humidity will cause the rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
The number of 2 to 4 inches of rain is estimated to fall in some parts of the West of the day, especially in most of Arizona.
A flood of improbable weather occurs with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the widespread tropical rain.
It is not recommended to explore the desert by walking on foot because of the tropical rain threat.
The torrents of rain may become violent rivers, and the storms may bring on the winds of local winds and floods.
The nearest peak will cause local rains to form part of the South California coast.
The total rainfall that is more than half an inch allows, which can cause small points to flow and the highway to become lynched.
This will be the first rain in the area in their rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread on Monday and Sunday.
The great rains will spread to the top of the mountains on Tuesday and will endure to the ascent of Rabbah.
In October there will be some great temperature changes across the United States when the Arctic is colder, but the tropical region remains quite warm.
Sometimes this causes a dramatic change in temperature in the short distance.
There's an exact example of the dramatic temperature difference across the middle U.S. area on Sunday.
There is a difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the rest of the summer will be formed and will return to the preaching work.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. territory is expected to start warm in October at 80s from the South Plain to the eastern parts of the sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high chance for temperatures above averages for the eastern US until mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by the Supreme Court's award Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing the expected sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blazey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political debate continues, with publishers holding a regular event to announce the unexpected events in the last minute of Friday: An agreement planned by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation on the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that the woman 100 percent believed that Kavanaugh was in a drunken state and tried to take off her clothes at the High School.
Kavanaugh, in his burning testimony, said he was 100 percent certain it didn't happen.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
The company counted the percentages of clients in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for other networks that broadcast this thing is not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually had trouble counting the number of people who saw him in the office.
To put this in perspective, that's the number of players almost equal to the football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, which the leaders think is very supportive of Kavanaugh's show, is the exception of all networks with an average of 5.69 million pollinators throughout the congregation all day, says Nielsen.
ABC's second position is 3.26 million.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million users and CNN has 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
Interests remain high after the trial.
Flake was the key figure in the drama that Friday.
After the office of the Moderate Republic Party issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, being shouted by the passersby as he tried to climb to the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was hunted down, broadcast directly at CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have strength when there are many women who are helpless."'"
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee congregation.
Cable TV and the broadcasting network are all wrapped up directly a few hours later, when the Judicial Committee will choose to advance Kavanaugh's call to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he'd only do it with the understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the elite for a week or so, as the minority Democrats have asked.
Flake has been convinced by some conversation with his friend, Senator of the Democratics Chris Coons.
Talking to Coons and some senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republic party won't have the voice to approve Kavanaugh without any research.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister charges critical 'political player' of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critic of "political gambling" with Britain's future and ruining national interests, on his plan to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews shown on the front page, foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed an attack on what he called a Chequers plan for Brexit, said that the proposal for England and the EU to collect tariffs was "full of no sense."
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police captured the suspect Diteon Simpson in the LSU player's death.
Police have caught a suspect in a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20 - year - old LSU basketball player.
Diteon Simpson, 20 years old, has also been arrested and sentenced to two levels of murder, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
A video confrontation officer between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glass of eyes at the scene and said they found the Simpson DNA on the stuff, the CBS WAFB affiliate reported.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he confessed he had made a fatal shot at Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Coroner Paroki Baton Rouge East's office reviewed the initial report on Friday, saying the cause of death was gunshot wounds on the head until it hit the neck.
The department is grateful for the task of the Louisiana State Police, the state police lab, the Southern University police, and the surrounding citizens in assisting in investigations leading to arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the lawmakers in the area for "the persistence and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old then.
Six-six foot tall living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
The average point is 5.6 and heading to 2.6 in the game last summer.
On Friday morning, coach LSU Will Wade said his team felt "broken" and "sudden" with the death of Wayde.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," said Wade.
The mountains of the fires are beating down the ashes in Mexico City
The clouds that came out of the mountains of Popocatepetl have reached the southern region around the capital of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre has warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the mountain of fire after activities have increased in the field and are listed there are 183 emissions of gas and sand in over 24 hours.
The center was a few times intimidating and violent.
The pictures in the social media show a small layer of dust that is stuck in the front of the car window around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity on a volcano that is 45 miles (72 km) south of the city's capital since the 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico in mid-September 2017.
This Mount Fire is known as Don Goyo, which has been active since 1994.
The police broke up with Catalan separatists to celebrate their independence election.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesting pro-freedom riots with the anti-fraud police, and when thousands joined the demonstration to mark the first event of the catalonian polarisation's self-departure.
A group of pro-separatist hats held by the anti-circumvention police are going to throw them eggs and throw them into the hole, so that they create dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually filled by tourists.
The fight also followed that day with a police officer using their staff to control the dispute.
For a few hours, pro-free groups shouted "Don't forget, there's no forgiveness" in front of a union of workers who shout, "Hip Spanish."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries to the protest, reports the local press.
The tensions remained high in this free-forsaken region, one year after the October 1st referendum, which Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The electorate prefers to be free, even though the number of candidates is low with those who oppose separation and most of the candidates.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the noise from happening on the network throughout the region in severe turmoil.
Pro-freedom groups have camped at night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer expected Catalonia's prospect of independence.
"Last year we spent one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry the violence because they can choose, but now we're trapped," he said.
Although it was a success to win a vital victory even in the December regional elections last December, Catalan pro-freedom parties have fought to defend this moment this year despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in solitary confinement or in detention waiting for the trial, on their role in organizing referendums and further declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with her cell phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been tackled by politicians on both sides.
"Now it's getting tougher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned earlier since the end of last year, announced that he would recommend himself in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The best way to threaten independence in the values of democracy and persecution that we've seen from the Spanish government is to stand as candidates for European elections," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after a repeated car hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage happened at the gate and the building itself.
A drill might also have been shot in the direction of the car at a few points.
Goal printed by Menga has won for Livingstone on Rangers with score 1-0
First goal Dolly takes for Livingston to make sure you win
Livingston's victory resulted in the Rangers firing Steven Gerrard from his position as the manager of the Ibrox Club, for both defeats in 18 matches.
The Dolly Menga attack has proved that there is a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is parallel to that of the Hibernian in the second order.
Gerrard's side remains unbeatable in this summer's premiere and faces the Hearts leaders who are eight points ahead of them, the next Sunday.
Previously, Rangers ate Rapid Vienna at the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended the unbeatable record of them in the division to six matches, while coach Holt's head was still making losses since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston lost his chance against a smart guest team
The Holt team should have chosen a long time before they scored a goal, with the accuracy of those who gave Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his efforts were read across the gangway, and then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after he entered and faced Craig Halkett's escape from the gangway.
Homeowners are pleased to have the Rangers play a great game in the first place, knowing that they can make it difficult for the incoming team to make the event a dead ball.
And that's how to make a very important goal.
Rangers of free movement and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Manga, who got a turn and scored from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers has dominated power but realizes that the housekeeper's defense cannot be beaten and Liam Kelly's Cyprus is completely uninterrupted,
The pattern goes on to second grade, although Alfredo Morelos managed to hunt down Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was alarmed by Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow's guards' feet far removed as a result of the other Livingston tactics.
The attack continues to come to the feast of Livingston and continues to avoid, while two defendants claim--after Halkett's challenge on Glenn Middleton's replacement players, and one for handball--rejected.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal results for Livingstone.
For a man, they're amazing, continuing beyond hope on this continuing journey.
Their playful style and their staff have not changed since they returned to the top of the board, but great credit has to be given to Holt for how he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He's got so many cheerleaders.
Captain Halkett is very big, leading a well-organized defense, while Manga keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert during the game.
Nevertheless, Rangers lack inspiration.
Whatever they were at the time under Gerard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball is less good - only once they can break the formation of the side of the house - and it is a reminder to Rangers, who realizes their presence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan got a different welcome to Cologne.
There were smiles and blue skyscrapers on Saturday (September 29th) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They argue about problems including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have mentioned reasons for security to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters have moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters -- many of them Kurdish -- also voiced, threatened both of them, Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to that country.
The opposition protests describe an opposition to the existence of a incoming hero who was welcomed as a hero by some Turkish people and was persecuted as a dictator by others.
Hit Deptford Street: Bike rider killed in a car crash
A motorbike driver died in a car crash involving a car in London.
The crash took place near Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, many streets in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The crash took place months after another bike driver died in a run-off at Children Street, about 1 mile away from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan police say the officers are trying to identify the man and preach to his family.
The roads were closed and the bus routes were switched off, and the motorists were shaken to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured officers in the riot
Six people in Cyprus suffered injuries in a man’s prison with strict custody, the office said.
Disappointment occurred at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and still continues.
Special Agent "Tornado" has been assigned to deal with the complaint, involving eight prisoners and taking place on one side of the building.
Officers are being treated at the scene because of minor facial injuries.
One prison judge said: "The specially trained layman has been assigned to handle the incident taking place in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend a longer time behind the Iron Curtain."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has sheltered more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October of last year, an anti-circumvention officer was called into prison to deal with a serious complaint where an anti-circumvention officer was attacked with a billiard.
The pink storm threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with the floods.
The tropical depression that hit Arizona is rare, but that's what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week because of the energy trace of the Rose storm that's left over the desert of the West, causing a slow flood risk.
The National Weather Service has issued a warning that there will be a flood on Monday and Tuesday for the West Arizona region until South Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was expected to head straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, hit on Monday night with the rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said on Twitter that there are only "ten tropical peaks capable of causing tropical storms or depression in the 200-mile Phoenix area since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a disaster in 40 miles of the AZ border."
The most recent Emergency Instruments have been able to predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with the number of isolations reaching 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
The other western desert areas include Rockies and Great Basin are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, possibly the number of isolations reaching 4 inches.
For those in the fertile area, the rain of the Rosa may be a blessing because of the drought.
Although the flood is a serious problem, most of the rains are likely to benefit from the current drought in the western part of the world.
According to the U.S. D., only about 40 percent of Arizona's territory has suffered a little extreme d.o.b., second highest category," weather.com reports.
First, the trail through the Rosa Storm leads to land across California Bay on the Mexican side
Rosa, still at the storm on Sunday morning with the wind speed 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north with the speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm came upon the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore its strength was weakened.
That's why it's supposed to land in Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or at night.
Rainfalls may be high in parts of Mexico, causing high flood risk
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is estimated to travel across the Baja California region to the western zone of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border today as a tropical depression, which will pass through Arizona and into the South North at midnight.
"The main risk that may be caused by the Rosa storm or the rest of it is a very high rainfall in Baja California, the western sonora region, and the western US desert power area." The National Storm Centre (NHC) said.
It is estimated that the floodwaters and the floodwaters would threaten the desert and lead to the desert, resulting in a longsorous land in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton's attack: capture of four suspects attempted murder
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound at Somerset.
The boys were found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in stable condition.
A 17 - year - old, two 18 - year - olds, and a 20 - year - old man were arrested last night in the Radstock, Avon, and Somerset area, said the police.
The officer has been horrified at anyone who might have the video of the incident on his cell phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh 'receiving hatred and anger' from the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the harsh and shameful democratic party," Trump said on a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "receiving hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the recruitment process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had committed sexual violence to him several decades ago while they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified in the debate about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the wisdom and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is the voice to strengthen someone who has the most perfect law thinking in our time, a jury with a record of the true public servant," he told the West Virginia supporters crowd.
The president implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's recommendation when he talks about the importance of the Republic's participation in the middle of the election.
"Five weeks before it happens, one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I went there to come, fight for a great chaplain.
Trump argues that the Democrats are on a mission to "oppose and block."
The procedure for the first vote on the Senate level in Kavanaugh's recommendation is expected to be carried out as late as Friday, a GOP senior leader's assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people died as a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, tsunamis, and increased numbers of victims.
At least 384 people were killed, many who were devastated when a giant storm hit the beach, when a terrible earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a holiday at the beach in Palu on Friday, when a wave of six meters (18 feet) destroyed the beach at night, causing much death and destroying whatever it went through.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and not running away until they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Disaster Relief Body (BNPB) said at the summit in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, slammed everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at 800 kph (497 mph) before slamming the shoreline.
Some people climb a tree to save themselves from tsunamis and safety, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 service centers in Palu.
The photos of the air produced by the BNPB show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges and mines, and a church surrounded by water.
The storms of thunder struck the city along that beach on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in the region of 2.4 million people.
The Research and Technology Monitoring Body (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released on the massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city’s geography, which is at the end of the long narrow bay, can increase the size of the tsunami, can be said to be.
Nugroho describes the damage that has occurred as "extensive" and says that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under ruined buildings, he said, adding that there were 540 injured victims and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be greater along the 300km shoreline (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Dongala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication "very vague with no information from Donghala, says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Crescents in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading toward a region affected by disasters.
"This is a tragedy, but this could be worse," he said.
The relevant forum on Saturday received a lot of criticism because it did not inform them that there was a tsunami that struck Palu, although the authorities said that the wave had broken when the warning was issued.
An amateur record shared in the social media shows a man on the floor above a building that sounds alarming with panic will be a close tsunami, towards the people on the street below.
In the minutes of the water drop on the beach, the building and the car were destroyed.
Reuters can't immediately prove the authenticity of the recording.
Storms and tsunamis are the biggest cause of electric shocks that disrupt communications around Palu so that authorities are difficult to coordinate their salvation efforts.
The military has already begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but refugees still need food and other trees.
The airport has been opened up again just to get help and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami Indonesia's victims have risen to over 800.
That's very scary.
When World Vision officials from Dondala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the officers sheltered in the tent cloths that were built in the courtyards of their office, on their journeys they had crossed a number of rocky areas, said Father Doseb.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
That's terrible.
Even when a group of donors began to move slowly to start disaster relief activities, some of them undermined the presence of skilled foreign volunteers who were going to the Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rules, kidnappings, aid and power from outside the country can only be initiated if the affected area has been officially declared as a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the red flag of Indonesia.
"When the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we can get international help, but there is no status."
And on the second night there will be disaster and tsunami in Palu, and companions and relatives of the deceased, hoping that those whom they love will be part of a miracle that will correct the course of the worst of events.
On Saturday, a boy was expelled from the prison.
On Sunday, the rescuer took out a woman stuck under a wheel for two days with her mother’s dead body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a national Indonesian paramilitary team coach, has become a coach for two missing paramilitary athletes, able to follow the Asian Games that ended in early this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped at Hotel Roa-Roa, with Father Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As an elder in the paramilitary field, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Father Gendon told us again how after the news of Hotel Roa-Roa that had been destroyed away from around the paralytic community, he was desperate to send whatsApp's message to the Palu competitors, who also attended a party on that beach.
Even so, all his messages, only one sign of the shadow, not two blues.
"I think it means an unsent message," he said.
Robbery took $26,750 during ATM in Newport in Levee
The robbery on Friday morning, he stole $26,750 from a Brink officer who's refilling the ATM storage box at Newport, based on a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver has emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and is ready to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was at work, another man ran behind Brink's staff and stole one bag of money that would be sent.
Witnesses saw some suspects fleeing from the scene, according to the news, but the police did not mention the number of people involved.
Anyone who has information about their identity can contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Posting the name change over Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has had Ye's nickname for some time and uses it as his eighth album title, which was released in June.
The change was made before it appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to score his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to show off on the show, which was cancelled because of "emotional reason," says the creator of the show.
As a summary of his current professional name, the former West said that for him the word had religious meaning.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, discussing the album title with Radio Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
The name was taken from Kanye, which means only, being Ye-- as a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a mirror of our true self."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known in various ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of linkage and Large Letter.
President of Mexico, AMLO, swears not to use military in the face of civil society
The President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has already sworn never to use military force against civil society until the 50th anniversary of the bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promises Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to pressure the Mexicans."
The army launched a shot at peaceful demonstration activities on the beach on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the movement of left wing students planted its roots throughout the Latin American region.
Lopez Obrador has guaranteed support for young people in Mexico by providing monthly grants to those who are studying and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities motivated young people to form criminal gangs.
The A.S. was supposed to reflect the A.I.
Because China is more active in manufacturing intelligence, the U.S. is supposed to be reflecting the number of funds that will be used for research in the field, says the investor and practice A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who has been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. overall lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China recognized its plan last year: to become number one in the 2030 AI innovation.
"Recognising AI research funding is a good start, remembering all the other countries are lagging far away from the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Estimates of funds can illustrate the possibility that the next major achievement of AI will be made in the U.S., Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beats the best American Othello player, and then he acts as an executive in Microsoft Research and the Chinese Google President.
Lee acknowledged the previous U.S. government technology competition as a Robotic Challenge for the Recent Defense Research Project and asked when the next activities would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win a gift from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes over the academics; it's a company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been working at universities for AI research for the past few years.
Lee says that changing immigration policies can also help the US to support an AI-cycle effort.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically to the PHD professional in the field of AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its next generation Smart Development Plan in July 2017.
Chinese Science Yayas provides funds for people in academic institutions as well as other government organizations that divide money into U.S. researchers, but the quality of the academic task is lower in China, Lee says.
Early this year in the U.S. Department of Defence developed the Joint Building Intelligence Centre, which aims to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee for Building Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
While for NSF, DARPA recently invested over $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for it to be set up by the National Security Commission for Construction Intelligence did not see any further action for months.
The Macedonians are making noises in the order of the country's name
The Macedonian people made a raise on Sunday to decide to replace the country's name as "the Republic of North Macedonia," an action that will resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has thwarted its bid to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, defends the view that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents ownership recognition of its territory and has banned its association with NATO and the European Union.
The two sides reached agreement in June on a new name, but national opposition argued that changes would destroy the identity of most of the Macedonian ethnic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the election results could reach the minimum of 50 percent of the votes required for the election to be declared valid.
The question at the voiceball is, "Do you accept NATO and the EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
The name changer, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argues that it is the price to be paid in order to obtain entry permits within bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I come today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live free under the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, many members of parliament say that they will obey the outcome of the vote.
The change of name required a two - and - a - three - percent volume of speech in the parliament.
The Country Election Commission said there was no infringement report until 1 p.m.
However, the result of the vote was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the voters gave their vote.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a voter in the city's capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice to the Macedonian public election in a series of country name changes that would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of a parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, has prepared a small stage and has drawn chairs in front of the tents made by those who will hoist those voices.
"We agree to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join respectfully, not through the waiter's door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe most people will accept it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his voice.
He said the result "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute on Monday last night stated that between 30 and 43 percent of the electorate would take part in the vote - less than the required number.
In another opinion, sponsored by the Telma Macedonia TV station, 57 percent of respondents planned to come along and give them their voice on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent say yes.
In order to achieve that success, 50 percent need to be added to one voice.
A failure in the voicemail will represent the first policy rejection of the pro-Barat government since May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City is exploring the entire Brighton defense to print goals.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were given as a defense to Brighton in the Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy for him to score in 65 minutes.
The attacker received an operand in the middle of the field at the start of the match.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenders, before he got into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green peacocks.
He swam through one of the defenders before running ahead of a few other opponents at the end of Brighton's gang.
Then he ran to the left, to Sterling.
The British frontal lobe took advantage of its first swing from the gangway to operate the ball back to Aguero, which used its right foot to defeat Brighton's Cyprus, Mathew Ryan with a thrust to the right of the gangway.
"Aguero fights with some problems on his feet," said the Pep Guardian City manager to the reporter.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're pleased he scored a goal at that time."
But Sterling is the one who gave the first advantage to Sky Blues in the Prime Minister League's fight.
The target happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero takes the ball, far away in Brighton on the game.
He was working the ball with a far - reaching excitement over Leroy Sane’s left wing.
Sane did a little ball kicking before leading Sterling to the remote post.
Sky Blue's front slide moves the ball to the right direction of the ladder before the ball launches out of the border.

Scherzer wants to hire a stalker against Rockies
With the elimination of Nationals from the playoff game, there's no more reason to force another game.
But Scherzer is too competitive to be able to beat Colorado Rockies on Sundays, but only if there's still playoff involvement for Rockies, which is great in one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies at least didn't get a place after winning the game wild-cards against the Nationals with a score of 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division.
"Even though we play without winning, at least we can't know the atmosphere in Denver with a crowd of spectators and other teams who will compete at the highest level of any point I might be facing this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a game?"
Nationals haven't announced an open match for Sunday, but it's reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer join the match.
Scherzer, who will begin the song for 34 times, holds a training session on Thursday and starts a Sunday game that is usually used to rest.
Washington's right-hand Pitcher is 18-7 with an average run (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-out in 220 2/3 innings.
The campaign trump in West Virginia.
The president is particularly concerned about the situation of the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the voice of the Republican public in the middle of the election.
"All our efforts were in danger in November.
Five weeks before he made the most important choice in our life.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an extraordinary candidate," he said.
Trump continues, "You see there's a group of radical democrats that are very alarming, you can see it happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you see their wickedness, their wickedness.
They do not care who is injured, so that they may gain power and control. That is what they desire, and We do not give them authority.
Democrats, he says, are on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he says, "democratics are called anger and evil and evil and can't be trusted."
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein, who served on the Senate Trial Committee by naming him, who was warmly welcomed by his audience.
"Remember what the answer is?
Do you want to reload the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I'm waiting for him-- that's a very bad body language-- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a public service place.
Now it's an intolerance to anyone who's looking at his mind.
When Momentum's activist at my local party gave me a voice to threaten myself, it was not surprising.
Besides, I was in the last order of Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we expressed our views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she strongly defended anti-Semitism.
In my case, those threats criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, the ironic issue facing Jeremy Corbyn and his former leaders.
The news for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday said that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I became a member of the local Labour Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday night was exactly the same.
Unfortunately today, the quality of many meetings and promises about politics that is "better, more friendly" has not been forgotten for a long time, if, indeed, it has ever begun.
The differences in opinion in the party’s work are clearly not tolerated and each opinion is valued by the party’s authority.
It started as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I thought I would be able to share the same political view, began to expect me to turn around and accept a position that I would never like to accept before -- well in national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly - and don’t care what I say - then there will be a poll in the media society that asks for a show-off, a policy abuse, tell me I shouldn’t be at the Labour Party.
And it wasn't just me who experienced it.
Of course, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because of the comments I have made to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day, but I have never avoided them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of today's political era is the extent to which abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a wider church and with each motion "untrusted" or changing the party rules to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that moved me to keep down my head, not too much to express my opinion, and then I'll say, "OK."
But I'm stuck in politics, not doing that.
Since I joined the 32 - year - old Labour Party when I was still a school student, provoked by the upbringing of Thatcher’s government that caused my class of understanding to fall literally, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who need it very well - as local councillors and ministers in government.
I never hid my political actions, including in my last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my political position and things that I disagree with in leadership right now.
For those who promote motion on Friday, which I can say is when the country moves rapidly towards the division of sovereignty, that would endanger our country's business and public service, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constitution, as a member of the Labour Party or not.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Father
The last two trials may have been a little over-the-counter, but no doubt Ayr is worth winning the Tentent's Premiership game that is very relaxing today.
Now they're in the top order, the only unbeatable side of ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and their ability to get the best chances, which made the home team and coach Peter Murchie get the right to feel comfortable.
"So far we have tried our game, and we have not yet won so we feel happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "The respect for Ayr, they're better off taking a chance than what we're doing."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Air ahead, but a yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, was given at that game by Warriors, giving Melrose the chance to print the numbers and Jason Baggot stole an unconverted attempt.
Climo pushed Air's leadership with a clock, before, right in the middle of time, he scored goals and then made a single attempt to make Air's score 17-5 at a time of rest.
However, Melrose successfully started her second half, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, as modified by Baggot, reduced her chances to five points.
Then there was a long mind because Ruarid Knott suffered serious injuries, was kicked out, and from the start of the match, Air went ahead faster than the Stafford McDowall, modified by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a spare player pay with Bruce Colvine's unaltered attempt, at the end of the pressure.
The housemaster has returned to play, but, at the time the Hutchinson Struan got a yellow card because he was holding the Climo without a ball, from the watch line, MacPherson arrived behind the injured Ayr.
The climate was replaced, as it happened again, almost from the beginning of the match, after Kyle Rowe made a forced cease and disrupted the fifth effort by Gregor Henry.
The Still Game star appears ready to pursue his new career in the restaurant industry
The Still Game Star appears to be ready to move the way to the service industry after it was previously known that it was repaired as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis, 56 - year - old at a popular BBC event, was staged and also stared at by his former comedian partner, Greg Hemfill.
The couple have announced that the series of nine coming is the last episode, and it seems Kiernan is planning to drive the broadcast directly after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's the Director of Aerobingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun official pointed out that Kiernan was trying to get involved in "the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
“ The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that justice will return to the Pacific.
Sailors are patrolling the large outpost camp located in La Paz.
Public buildings built a blue flag.
The Navy camp from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with a motorcycle: "The sea is our legitimate right.
To return is an obligation."
Passing through Bolivia surrounded by land, the memory of the loss of a coast line to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still clear — like the desire to cross the Pacific again.
That hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, because Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the court on October 1, after a five - year trial.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly a positive hope for its results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who are going to watch the ICJ trial on a wide-ranging screen throughout the country hope that the courts in The Hague will support Bolivia’s claim that - after a few decades of confrontation - Chile is obliged to highlight the assurance of Bolivia’s sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the Bolivian president of the province of Bolivia, who was struggling with a controversial war for next year's election -- also has a lot of support for Monday's debate.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that justice cannot decide Bolivia's wishes-- and it will only change a little if it allows.
On the basis of the United Nations, there is no power to surrender the territory of Chile, and it has been determined that it will not determine the outcome of the competition.
That the ICJ ruling came only six months after the final argument was heard, which indicated the case "not complex," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean member of international law.
And still far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years there may have just been some resignation.
"The problem of access to the sea has now been undermined by the Bolivian government," he said.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric has weakened the good record of Chilean citizens, he says.
Bolivia and Chile at a certain point will remain unresolved, but it will be very difficult to remain debated after this.
Since 1962, the two countries have not been able to exchange military uniforms.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian government representative in The Hague, quickly rejected the idea of making decisions.
Monday will give Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with the profit together," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-is still one of the most famous Latin American presidents to use maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never release its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The debate is an opportunity to see what we need to resolve the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never have fired a nuclear weapon if Korea couldn't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He spoke of the United States as implementing the agreement made at a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comment appears when the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, appears to have almost begun a nuclear diplomacy that has faded for more than three months after meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri said only a "new dream" that by continuing to sanction and deny the U.S. declaration of the Korean War's end, North Korea would give up.
Washington is alert to agree to that statement without there being Pyongyang who made an effort to limit the armed forces first.
Well, Kim and President A.S. Donald Trump wanted to hold a second meeting.
But there's some doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the recognition of the country's weapons warehouse as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
The Paris mode show shows a lot of recent collections closing heads up to the main road near you
If you want to multiply the hat collection or really want to protect from sunlight don't look for others.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne produced a series of large-size head coverings for their SS19 collection on the stage of the fashion show in the fashion that took place in Paris Fashion Week.
A really impractical hat has wiped out Instagram in this summer and these designers have shown a creature that embraces the eye at the stage of the avalanche.
The remarkable thing about Valentino is a cream hat that is decorated with a wide top edge covering the model's head.
Large accessories, including a diamond - decorated bowl, witch hat, and even a pineapple, were not designed to encourage the head.
Thom Browne also showed a group of strange and exact hats to Halloween.
Many of the colored masks that his lips have made and the like of Hannibal Lecter are compared to the high couture.
A creature such as a shoal is made up of snorkel and glass of eyes, while it looks like a dry ice cream.
And if you keep going through the press collection - then you're famous.
The fashion viewers estimate that the collection of the big hats will be based on the main road near you.
The big hats are a very running train in La Bomba, a two-legged shirt with a two-legged edge that is used by all people including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The expansion of the label is reversed by a hat that is highly impractical to the silhouette of social media making a great creation on the shorewalks of its large dam almost equal to the swimwear - used with a smooth model.
The raffia bag that was burned, cut with raffia in the side of a white leather strap, is a highlight of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous Luke Armitage hairdresser said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see the big hat and the beach bag arrive on the main road for the next summer-- because the designer has already made a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the request for that big accessory."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are very important to the people of the world
Scotland’s private school maintained a record of academic achievement, and this was continued in 2018 with an extraordinary test, which was strengthened by every student and collective success in sports, art, music, and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools are represented by the Scottish School Council (SCIS) working hard to provide the best service for students and parents.
Schools are designed to prepare their students for further and higher education, their career in choice, and their role as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement school curriculums in line with our expectations, we have seen that modern language continues to be the focus of popular choice learning and desire in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in the language he understands, your speech will enter his head.
If you speak to him in his language, then your words will enter his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test this year, we can see that the language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation level in the secondary school.
A total of 68 percent of students learning a foreign language get the A Plus value.
The data was collected from 74 SCIS schools, which showed that 72 percent of students received the A Plus value in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish also received the A value.
This shows that schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that children and adolescents will certainly need in the coming years.
Currently, languages, as a choice of study eyes, are held in the same standard as those of STEM studies (scientific, technology, wealth and mathematics) in modern school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Power and Skills Service in 2014 found that for some reason the employer had to keep fighting in the lobby, 17 percent of the reason was lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare young people for their careers in the coming years.
As opportunities for work expand, this skill is vital in a global world.
Whatever career options a person has, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will experience real benefits because they have this kind of life - style.
It is possible to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will automatically make a great multilingualist in competition.
According to the comments of YouGov in over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to make conversations and French the only language spoken in two digits, that is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning for children now is an important thing for now.
Having multilingual skills, especially in the language of developing countries, will create a better opportunity for children to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on a more classic modern language, while others will teach the most important language in England for a few years to come, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in the secondary school, with the teaching staff of experts in this field.
The Scotland Mansion School is designed to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be assumed that at this point, in the global business environment, language will always be an important part of determining the future of the country, so this should be the third in education.
In fact, the modern language must really be regarded as "the ability of international communication."
The secondary school will continue to offer choices, doubts, and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scotland Mandira School.
LeBron will perform debut for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Expectation of fans to see LeBron James begin his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening of Sunday's spring against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet determined how long he will play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that James is probably gonna play in a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plan for the six - game game schedule for Lakers.
"In my current career stage, I don't need to do a pro-season game to prepare," he said.
General Tour of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a close public campaign tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first public meeting of the five public meetings scheduled for next week, including a stopover in some of the nice places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was insisted that the vote was postponed so that he could elect a member of the Supreme Court, Trump meant building support for him for the general election half-time due to the risk of losing control of Congress if the vote was held in November.
What time is Trump's public in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Public Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the general Trump in West Virginia online through direct YouTube broadcasts.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's congregation for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which is becoming increasingly tense after the allegations of unpleasant sexual behavior and the Senate's expectation of the outcome will be postponed until one week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main purpose of this close public agenda is to help the Republic party to get some time in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign, the five most common targets this week are to "encourage volunteers and supporters because the Republic's parties are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the DPR," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is very important for its agenda so that the president will be as many as possible moving to the countries of the country as we face a busy campaign season," campaign leader Trump refused to mention his name to Reuters.
Offered to Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening the public is expected to be able to present supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract a call from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in one last month, the country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, a candidate for the West Virginia Senate of the Republic that was left behind in the wake of an opinion.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an effort to increase his opinion-raising," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team bravely defends its hope in a single Sunday match
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome sessions are perhaps needed in this Ryder Cup.
The momentary trapping is a concept of sports that is the result of a complete discovery by players, and no one goes beyond such competition.
Where do they think it's time?
"Before, they're above six points and now four, so I think we consider it a little moment," said Jordan Spyeth over that day.
Europe certainly has the advantage of having the top four points with twelve more games.
But Tim America, as Spyeth says, feels they have a little moment and they have a lot of things that can be exciting, except for the formation of Spyeth and Justin Thomas who play together all day and each one boasts three out of four points.
Spyeth has been fatally playing from tea area to green area and leading by example.
The celebration that the bear was celebrating is becoming louder when it turns, making an important kick to make a series match when he and Thomas lose two opponents.
The punching of him who won them on the number 15 that was accepted with a similar scream, the scream that lets you know that he's sure America doesn't lose.
"You really should try harder and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
All these players are gone now.
The 18 holes need to be marked.
The only player with more points than Spyeth and Thomas for two days ago was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed story from Ryder Cup.
Single but attractive couples from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't make a bogey hit on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seems to flow well to either of these lousy crowds that convince them that they are players to be defeated on Sunday, and there are no more famous players than Fleetwood or Molinari that will unlock Europe's potential for victory at sunset on Le Golf National.
It would be better if they were placed in different holes at the same time.
However, remain too busy to discuss Europe's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson reduced the work of Sergio Garcia, a fourball hero in the morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine like digging holes that will never be able to be planted by this Spanish golfer and Sweden.
Although, on Sunday, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a good show to see more closely because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how the strategy can change at a time.
So far, Europe has been playing better as a team and leading quite a long way to the final day, but the forum session also shows that the US team has the courage to compete despite being dubious by some, especially in the United States.
Europe's top 10-6 on Ryder Cup's last day
Europe will benefit from the final day of Ryder Cup after the rise of the fourball game and the foursome of Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
The duo inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two victories over Tiger Woods who have to fight to record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to defend an unattainable trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American target team in the morning fourball, making this series 3-1.
The United States has given more fights in the forums, winning two games, but they cannot reduce deficits.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points of 12 single-day games on Sunday to defend the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, which was named "Molliwood" after the end of the sensational week, were just the second pair to win four points of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs, they became very solid to defeat the slimming Woods and the American debut of Bryson Dechambeau with a stronger 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, once appeared brilliant but he has already lost 19 of 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting at fourball in the morning, then back to mate with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and losing 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranks one and three worlds.
Europe did not reach it on its own, even though the day was fun and exciting in West Paris.
The main winner three times set the size of the Americas by Jordan Spyeth and Justin Thomas with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 win that attracted Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then back again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the first two holes.
It just happened twice in the history of Ryder Cup where a team returned from the deficit of four points into a single game, although as a surviving team champion Fury just needed a series point to defend the trophy.
However, after becoming the second best for two days, the attack at the back of the day of the week seems to seem to be going too far.
North Korea says 'not possible' will disarm on one side without any confidence.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations about sanctions that were constantly intimidating their lack of trust in the United States and that it could not have disarmed its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's public official that North Korea had taken "steps that show good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, breaking up nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we didn't see any proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we cannot have our own weapons on the first hand."
While Ri repeats the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "step-up" approach to decriminalization where North Korea will be punished for taking step-by-step steps, a significant statement was made that they did not reject completely as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit between the United States President's office and the North Korean leader this first time in Singapore on 12 June, at which time Kim promised to try to "declare himself in favour of Korea" while Trump promised North Korea's security guarantee.
North Korea has wanted to end the Korean War 1950-53 officially, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected the call for international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is insisting on "primarily nurturing" and increasing pressure with the granting of seminal sanctions to achieve their purpose with force, and even refusing to "declaration of the end of the war," says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel down is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions will gradually sink into our disbelief."
Ri did not mention a plan for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which was convened by the United States leaders in the United Nations this week.
The minister even hosted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leaders of the Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the difficult side of this investigation is South Korea and not the United States, the Korean invasion will not find such a disparate way."
However, Ri's speech dramatically different from last year's, when he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly that targeting North Korea's rockets on the US soil was something that could not be avoided after "Mr. Devil President" Trump called Kim "the human rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year in a U.S. meeting, Trump last year threatened to "destruct" North Korea altogether, praising Kim for her courage to take steps to make a trip, but the big job still needs to be done and sanctions should continue to be imposed until North Korea is decriminalized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months -- no problem," he said.
Tiongkok and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the steps being taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must be continued firmly and must not fail until we know that full, final and verified disarmament is fully implemented."
The Security Council has been increasing sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as a means of halting the delivery of nuclear programmes and pyongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri at only the United Nations General Majority and then said that he was going to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his final trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there has actually been progress, only North Korea in clock counting is the one who makes himself a "claimer like a gangster."
North Korea promises in a meeting with the moon this month to blow up the missile sites and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes the "appropriate action."
He said Kim told him to do "the right thing" with his wish is a security guarantee Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalizing Washington relations.
Harvard student took a course on sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year made all S1 students there sleep more, in an effort to fight the macho culture in a study that is being developed through the 'human ghost' of caffeine.
One academic found that students at the university number one world often know nothing if they discuss very basic matters about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of specialist sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, plans a course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the effects of less sleep on the study.
'At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I just told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping -- which surprised me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, explained to the students the essentials of how good the habit of sleeping helps academics and athletes to improve their overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding students who had very little sleep all week.
The course over an hour involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there is a picture of an ashtray room, where students click on coffee cups, dishes, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as how athletic results are influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep routine.
On the other hand, researchers have been told how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then moved the audience to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change the student's behavior instinctively.
But we're sure they have the right to know--as you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke in health,' grew Prof. Czeisler.
A culture of pride with 'sex' still exists, its weather, added that modern technology and pressure that continues to increase in students that means lack of sleep is a continuing problem.
Make sure you sleep well enough, with good quality, to be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, its water--even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain activate the mode of hunger, causes the feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old in California, who studied chemistry and physics and who helped Professor Czeisler to plan the course, took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize a course for the whole campus.
In the next step, he hopes that the entire student will be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommends that students should consider organizing sleep alarms, including wake-up alarms, and realizing the effects of ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic displays and LED lamps, which can trigger the Circumstance rhythm out of its course to cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Downgrading Gerard's mental forces
Besides, Rangers felt the sadness of the day when Dolly was attacked to deliver Steven Gerrard's third row team to a 1-0 loss in Livingston.
Team Ibrox has been trying to record their first victory on their journey, since winning 4-1 in February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team just gave a second defeat to Gerard in 18 games as manager, causing the team to leave eight points of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts class leader.
Attacking seven minutes before the first round is over and Rangers who are out of their mind don't seem to balance.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third position, leaving only a series of goals from the hibernian.
And there might be further problems in Rangers' cave after the Calum Spence liner needs to be treated because the wound in the head after an object is thrown away from the distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that took Air to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took one point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with a costume that loved their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the ball ownership, but Livingston takes advantage of the ball they have better.
They should have recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bait was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's shell, but the trigger pulled the big opportunity too wide.
The free custody of Keaghan Jacobs in the past met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow can only penetrate a wide space in the back.
Rangers took control, but there seems to be more hope than confidence in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to get a warrant when he and Steven Lawless hit a four-hour sign but Steven Thompson refused to compare the Colombians.
Rangers managed to do only two throws in the first round but Ibrox guard before, Liam Kelly, almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's headache and easy-to-be Ovie Ejaria's attack.
Although Livi's opening target in the 34th minute might be opposed to the race path, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again, Rangers failed to overcome the deadly tactics of the internal Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher placed the ball in Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard took action while resting with Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the replacement soon gave direct effect when that winged player placed the ball on Morelos but Kelly who played the impressively fast out of the line to fight.
But Livingston continues to force the farm team to play the exact game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett erasing all the long balls.
Team Holt should have expanded their power at the end, but McGregor stood up well to drive out Jacobs before Lithgow slips wide from the corner.
Rangers, Glenn Middleton, claimed the watch again when he quarreled with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face.
Almac: Find Geiger’s Cinderella
And now from our Sunday Morning page: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and the trouble will continue... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was a discovery that eventually made the device known as the Geiger Speech.
As a scientific andanal device since then, Geiger has also become a pop culture andanal, as in the 1950's film "Bells of Coronado," by cowboy scientists who seem to be less convinced by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Recycling, used to find radioactive mineral sites, such as uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effect released by radioactivity in the mineral."
Evans: "Tell me, it must be coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that kept his name alive.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' the evil cell
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' the evil cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune systems to recognize bad cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from the patient, transforming it into a laboratory
They can then 'know' a common protein on many cancers and then injected again
A test vaccine shows the results of various types of cancers.
One woman was treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize the evil cell, and her ovarian cancer was lost for more than 18 months.
This method involves the patient's immune cell extraction process, transforming it into a laboratory so that they can "know" the proteins that are commonly present in many cancers called HER2, and then inject the cell back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Agency at Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The result is that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives up some types of cancer," including breast, ovary, lungs, and colorectal, Prof. Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking patients' immune cells and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West started Diatribe Pro-Trump, wearing the MAGA hat, after the SNL show.
Not a Good Walk
Kanye West was on the studio during Saturday Night Live after showing up where he praised the United States President Donald Trump and said he'd be recommending himself in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, the name Ghost Town where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic Party and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
The SNL started the show with a sandwiches by Matt Damon where the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the West's tracking tape was uploaded to the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock's trying to joke about the West with that statement.
In addition, the West complained to the viewers that he had trouble behind the stage because of the hat he wore.
"They hung me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They hugged me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes, "Do you want to see a dive?" says that he's going to wear Superman's clothes, because this means you can't figure out what to do.
Try to love."
The comment produced at least twice of the viewers and SNL performers seem ashamed, Variety reported, with one person saying, "The whole studio is silent."
West was taken in the last few moments as a replacement for Ariana Grande, a former Mac Miller rap singer's ex-girlfriend who just died a few days ago.
The West confuses many with the appearance of the song I Love It, dressed like the Botol Perrier.
West got support from the conservative leader of the TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote tweets: "To one of the bravest souls: TO BE LOVEFUL TO BE WATCHFUL."
But the conductor of Karen Hunter's show wrote a tweet that West just "becomes himself and it's really very good."
"But I chose not to offer someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") that I believed to wear and tear down a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "an officially known creature as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Along with rap singers, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and must have been the legend of Prince music, transformed his name into a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.
Claims for attempted murder at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was beaten at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The buyer was expected to be present before the Belfast State Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the Attorney General.
Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticizing poison masculinity
The Harington Kit is famous for its sword-fighting role as Jon Snow in the half-century fantasy series of violent HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, surpassing the stereotype of the macho hero, he said that the role on the screen of that kind of thing makes teenagers sons often feel that they should be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he was sure 'something wrong' and asked how to deal with the bad masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his opponent at the Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'strong enough' to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, strong enough, right now--where are we wrong in this masculinity thing?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for its bad masculinity with its very masculinity.
He continued: 'This place is a place of birth and what has been taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions at this time - how do we change it?
'Cause there's clearly something wrong with young people.'
In that interview he also admitted that he would not play in the Prequeul or the Secular Game of Thrones when this serial will end in the coming summer, he said he was 'completed with the field of war and horses'.
Since November Kit will tell him the truth West of Sam Shepard, a story about the filmmaker and his brother, who was a thief.
The recent actor revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I've met my wife in this show, so give me the future family, and from here my life begins' his words.
Rose played Ygritte, the character love flower of Jon Snow, in the fantasy series of this Emmy winner.
The couple got married in June 2018 in the home of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Tiongkok reports 14% of new cases
Tiongkok has announced 14% of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are displaced in this country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 only.
Most of the new cases have been abandoned through sex, marking changes from the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading through several parts of Tiongkok as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people living with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, the health office of Tiongkok said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in Tiongkok has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT Tiongkok community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Tiongkok in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT people is called more and more concern.
Because of this country's conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many diseases are caused by inadequate sexual protection in this regard.
Since 2003, the Tiongkok government has promised universal access to HIV as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that the staff have leaked data from the GOP Senator, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
The U.S. Attorney-General Maxine Waters on Saturday objected that one of his staff members had sent personal information to three United States senators to the Wikipedia Parliament.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party insisted that the claim was motivated by experts and ultra-right wing websites.
"A lie, a lie, and many more malicious lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It's reported that the information listed includes the address of the home and the U.S. Senator's phone number, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
That information came online on Thursday, sent by strangers in Capitol Hill during the Senate panel on charges of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
This outbreak occurred shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState report that the IP address identifying the source of the shipment is linked to the Waters office and discloses information from one of the Waters staff members, Hill reports.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is really wrong and is a false lie," said Waters.
"Members of my staff -- who are identity, personal information, and his safety is at stake as a result of fraud and misbehaviour -- are not at all responsible for the leaking of this information.
This is not a false accusation, and it is a lie."
Waters’ statement quickly attracted criticism, including former White House Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This part means anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something that he does not do, they should not be angry.
They can't go away.
They cannot question the defendant’s motives.
They will be safe and at peace."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday congregation.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republic's party that is trying to push Waters in half the time, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if you're right," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the right authority and law enforcement entities about this wrong charge.
"We'll make sure that the perpetrator is exposed," he added, "and they'll be legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to one and all my staff members."
Johnny's English Strikes Again - the rarest Rowan Atkinson sighting parody
Now looking for the meaning of Brexit in every new film with the usual view of England has become a tradition and it seems to be happening to reappear at the parody of Johnny English comedy songs - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the sarcasme of anger about how clearly it is bad we are being a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, Johnny English, who was staring at the roadside, face, and incompetent, has updated his license to ruin everything for the second time - his name gives more guidance than anything that he is a broad comic book designed for the cinema area to speak other than English.
Of course he's a crazy secret agent who, beyond his strange suspicion, has a little Clouseau character, except Mr. Bean's character and a group of hikers who contribute a little bit to the Chariots of Fire theme at the 2012 opening ceremony of the London Olympics.
Indeed, he is based on the visitors and the international mystery man Atkinson played on the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving chaos behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on the recent J.E.
I like it when Johnny English approaches the helicopter by wearing the mid-century daylight dress and rolling rotor as soon as it gets stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy was shown, but his humor felt less powerful and too strange, especially when the "serious" film label like 007 and Mission IP believed to put comedy as a substance.
It feels like it's meant for kids from adults, and for me, it's a lot of strange Johnny English that's uninvited and the focus of Atkinson's movie shows in Bean's personality.
The prize being warm these years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber journalist has entered the British super-secret web browser, revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint the tasked agent - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a proud and hostile prime minister, who has destroyed his entire political population: Emma Thompson plays a very good role with quasi-Teresa-May character but not much can be attributed to his writings.
His wise counselor gave information that since every active spy has been weakened, he must bring out a retired person.
And that means Johnny English himself, now employed as the head of a school in some wealthy buildings, but giving a secret lesson about how to perform a rescue operation: there are some good jokes here, when English offers a Academy of Watchmen like the School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency attention and again united with a long-standing friend who suffered from Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, he's got a submarine commander, a top-class woman who sucks where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit evicted.
So Batman and Robin, who made a mistake on the High Secret Agent, took action again, met the beautiful mystery woman Ophelia Bullettova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is concerned that the millions of charismatic technologies have been influenced to solve the problem of English computers: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their ridiculous adventures: sheltering as a waiter, burning fast French restaurants; they caused chaos by sneaking onto a Volta rich ship; and English launched anarchy when he tried to use the virtual reality headset to get used to the interior of the Volta house.
All stops must have been attracted to the last sequence, but with the hospitality and complaints like that, there are a few children's TV channels full of everything.
It's quite moderate.
And like the other Johnny English movie, I can't think of it: couldn't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a really good role for his talent?
Objection is planning a plan for British citizens to work four days a week but is paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn, from the Labour Organization, considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week but was paid five days.
The association is reported to want the company’s owners to continue their survival through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for workers by giving them additional holidays.
He will allow the workers to enjoy the weekend of three days but will continue to receive the same wage.
Some sources say that the idea would 'be compatible' with the party's economic agenda and the plan motivates the country to support the workers.
Changes to four days a week have been approved by the British Congress of Commerce as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A source, the senior of the Labour Force, told The Sunday Times: 'The focus on this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This won't happen last night, but four working days a week is an aspiration that fits the party approach to rebalance the economy that supports the workers and industrial strategies of the parties as a whole.'
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea, because the Green Party has promised four working days in a week at the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at this point the aspirations are not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokeswoman said: 'Five working days a week are not party policy and are not being considered by the party.'
The Chancellor of Shadow John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to complete his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'anonymous director' and the 'registrators' in the utility company.
This shadow cabinet also means that the current stockholders in the drinking water company may not get their entire stock back because the government of the Labour Party can do 'intervention' with a sense of violation.
He also made sure that his plan to put employees in the company hall and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, who would raise annual dividends to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told the "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the end of the vote on his own convictions in the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises questions as to whether this meeting could affect the senators of the Republic Party to withdraw their support.
In the interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes" correspondent asked the Senator of the Republic Party, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find something that could change their minds.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his partner in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd attend the trial, I said, I've already spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, and the charge came up, and I said, 'Are you doing it?'
He's a strong, firm, firm man."
However, it seems that Graham’s voice could not be changed.
"My mind has made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and needs a bigger claim to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett strongly objected," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned couldn't verify his name.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is meant by the Global Citizen Festival and what has this event done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be hosting the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event that shows the star scene that is very impressive, and a mission that is also effective; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy action by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the purpose of this truly ending extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international lawyers hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay the VIP ticket), the concert visitor has to complete a set of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending email to world leaders, calling, or other means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in reaching its goal for 12 years?
Do you think giving a free concert gift is the right way to invite people to take action, or just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped the world's leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of which has been channelled or budgeted.
This group estimates that the security fund has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some major commitments, including The Power of Nutrition, are made in England by investors and performers who commit themselves to "help children grow to their maximum potential," promise to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end the shortage of rice in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, the developer, the national government, and the Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustices about the lack of this figure a record in history," The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ulllman told a crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
This group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to increase nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Answering one of the questions in the Public Question on their website that asks "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizen answers: "This will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just as civil rights movements and the great anti-apartheids that have existed before us, we will succeed, because if we are united we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the stars that appear on this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "block" to halt the export of Russian energy - secretary in the country
"If necessary," Washington could ask the Navy to help prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary, Ryan Zinke said, as Washington Examiner said.
Zinke strongly believes that Russia’s involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operates on legitimate government calls - is a way to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to become energy brokers, just as they do in Eastern Europe, south of Europe," he reported.
And according to that office, there are ways and means of preventing it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure open sea routes, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the performers of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nirlaba group that called itself "the voice of energy customers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach in agreement with Russia and Iran, to see that in terms of efficiency, they are the same.
"Economic choices in Iran and Russia are less, taking advantage of and replacing fuel," he said, saying, challenging Russia as one of the "experts in that area" with an economy that relies on fossil fuel.
This statement emerges when Trump's judiciary is carrying out a mission in order to increase their natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is much cheaper for customers in Europe.
For this, Trump government offices, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to get Germany to pull itself out of the Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin a "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream oil plant project is worth $2 billion, which is designed to reflect the oil pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin objected that Washington’s hard fight against this project was simply driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy cannot be made a tool to exert pressure and that customers must be able to choose their own entourage," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has attracted a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has asked the US not to interfere with European energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a major problem if the third country mixes our energy markets," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "Excuse the situation" when recommending himself as President in 2020, Senator Massachusetts said.
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would "explain the situation" when he called himself president after a half-time election.
While campaigning at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider recommending himself.
"After it's time for women to go to Washington and repair our dirty government, including putting women on top," he told The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'm going to make a point of recommending myself as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when he was campaigning in the city hall, he said he "carried this area in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's blogs in criticizing Trump and the Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we make a noise call."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that much of Warren’s constitution did not want him to recommend himself in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "possible" election in Massachusetts said the senator would not recommend himself, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent support the recommendations.
The tone of opinion showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick for self - promotion, with 38 percent who supported the possibility of self - promotion and 48 percent who opposed it.
Other important names in the Democratic Party that were discussed on the possibility of recommending themselves in 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide on it in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin typed the PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with an accident of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What happens to my son, what will happen to him when he comes back, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our military suffered," he said in front of the audience at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "the plague in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they came back a little different, they came back a little harder, they came back and asked if there was any respect for what they had given, along with the soldiers and the pilots and every other military member of the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, added with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to And Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries in part, D.C. supports the challenge of new challenges policies
Eighteen countries and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new U.S. policy that rejects the challenge of fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
The lawyers from 18 countries and districts sent friends-of-the-court letters on Friday in Washington to support the most vulnerable politicians, NBC News reports.
The full name of Grace v. In the session of the American Civil Liberties Union in August for federal policy has not yet been revealed.
He said to his partner "and his son, who is a cruel gang member," had upset him, but the U.S. office refused his distress request on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The prosecution of the part - country supporters of Grace depicts El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produces a large number of hitchhikers for the United States, as a country with major gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. crisis policy is lagging behind the 2014 Immigration Council's decision to allow dark immigrants who flee from domestic violence to complain.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "refused the laws of the state, the federal, and the international that have existed for several decades."
"Federal law requires that all complaints be settled on the basis of facts and certain circumstances relating to the claim, and such a prohibition violates the principle," the friend-of-the court letter said.
Further, the prosecution gave a brief opinion that policies that refused to enter the U.S. economy have been detrimental to the economy, saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "responsible."
Judge General Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered the immigration judge to no longer give the victims a warning from domestic violence and gang violence.
"There are those who leave their country because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or social or political issues," the sessions said in this policy announcement on June 11th.
It doesn't mean to ease all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people are facing every day around the world.
The most sad relief effort in Palu because of the double sacrifice of the race time to find a safe victim
For those who survive, the situation is getting worse.
"It feels so much better," said Risa Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, calmed her boy child who was in the middle of a plane in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes bringing bodies.
Pure water is very rare."
People are looking back at their ruined houses, taking stuff that's in the water, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and treated in the hospital, the damage caused by a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake was devastating.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered fractures in the back and shoulder, lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of a severe earthquake.
Her eyes flow as she recounts her feelings again when the earthquake shook the five-storey hotel room where she stayed with her wife and daughter.
"Can't save yourself.
I think I'm trapped in a wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then shut up.
I didn’t know what was going on and what was going on with my son.
May they be safe."
U.S. Ambassador Tiongkok's charge with 'intimidating' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after Tiongkok's official newspaper posted a four-page ad on a U.S. day that called the profits of the US-Tiongkok trade back, the U.S. ambassador for Tiongkok accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday refers to the Chinese Daily Supplement to the Des Moines Registers - reportedly in the state of Iowa - after Tiongkok accused of trying to join the U.S. convention election on November 6th, a claim supported by Tiongkok.
Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to get involved in a U.S. election, which marks what the U.S. office says to Reuters, is a new phase in the increase in Washington's campaign to press Tiongkok.
Although it is common for the foreign government to place advertising to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington are at the heart of a growing trade war, which has led them to increase the import rate of each other.
The Tiongkok Revenge Rate at the beginning of this trade war was designed to strike exporters in countries such as Iowa, which support the Trump Republic, says experts Tiongkok and the United States.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to Tiongkok and former governor-in-chief of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural goods to Tiongkok, says Beijing has damaged workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Tionkok, Branstad wrote an opinion at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now it reflects the intimidation by running advertising on our own free media."
"In expanding its propaganda, the Tiongkok government has benefited from the tradition of freedom of speech and of press freedom that is highly appreciated in America by charging advertising paid at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the street newspaper kiosks here, in Beijing, you will find a barrier to different voices and will not see the real mirror of the different opinions that the Tiongkok people may have about the difficult economic transition of Tiongkok, remembering the media under the control of the Communist Party of Tiongkok," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in Tiongkok refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysis Alerts, Republican Party Defends Women’s Election to the Half-Time Selection With the Kavanaugh Disaster
Because the babysitters of important people in the Republic Party stand up and defend the leadership of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some allegations of sexual violence, the analysis has warned that they will see a back attack, especially from women, in the general half-time election.
Emotions about this problem are very high, and most members of the Republican Party have shown that they want to move forward on the issues.
It cannot be denied," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, said Syracuse University to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the Secretary's (R-Arizona) impulse Jeff Flake at the end-minutes to do FBI research would be enough to ease anger on the electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group said on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "November is near!" as they performed demonstrations at the Senate Hall when the Republic Party controlled the Judicial Committee to continue progressing in Kavanaugh's rejection of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Enthusiasm and democracy motivation will come out of the list," non-Stu Rothenberg political analysts told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women's vocalists in the area of youth and young electorate, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't give a voice."
Even before Ford’s public witness, who explained in detail the sexual harassment of himself by the Supreme Court’s leaders, the analysis suggests that there would be a back attack that would follow if the Republic Party continued to push him to make progress with confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of the Republic, early last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee or the final voice election or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the stand, it's also about how the Republic party deals with this problem and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, US Priorities Director, a group that helps choose the Democratic Party, pointed to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be breaking up about who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little bit more support for the last.
A new impression made by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents really believe or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's move, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under the oath before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh who was drunk attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court leader showed him his humiliation when they attended a party while they were at Yale in the 1980s.
Global Wide Web Tracker Plans to Start New Internet To Meet Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, a World Wide Web author, launched a startup that tries to listen to Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and whoever is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, as Berners-Lee jokes say that the meaning behind the Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to start it now," he said from the start.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to "save personal online data" or their own POD.
These stores may include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify that are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about storing this personal online data is that really depends on who can access what kind of information.
In the company it's known as "personal possession through data."
The idea of establishing an Inrupt, according to John Bruce's CEO, is for the company to present resources, processes, and skills that are very useful to help solids be available to everyone.
Now this company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of staffed contractors involved in the project, and a code-breaking volunteer community.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralization applications use tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change where all their business models would really be reversed last night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in network debate neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be Director and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: remind the ww1 Victoria Cross
The only author of the Church in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior, was remembered on the land of his birth 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann, won the victory on September 29, 1918, over the attack in Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a jet shooter and had never known that he had won the highest British military honor.
A warning stone was photographed by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "smart symbol" stone that would reveal his grandfather's nearly 100 years of appreciation.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "tossing a very heavy fog under the firefighting of the field and machinery."
Then he moved forward to the time line and with the "greatest courage" led the front line before he rushed using the weapon of his own field and paralyzed three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German gunman on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says his grandfather's action is "something I know I won't be able to live but it's a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also set up a flower shop after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "was very pleased to join this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that will be given by many."
MMA fans shared the night to watch Bellator 206, but they even got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you have been spending the night watching the 206 full Bellator just to refuse to watch the main event.
San Jose's report contains 13 battles, including six in the main card and is being presented directly all night in England at Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., just as the Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing to face each other, the audience in England was struck when their limbs became Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they have been separated to this special day for the fight.
A Twitter fan describes a change in children's cartoons as "a annoying joke."
"This is the rule of the government, that at 6 p.m. the content is not appropriate to be presented, so that it is replaced by the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Senior Marketing and Communications Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa's father," yes.
Bellator Scott Coker's president said they'd improve their schedule by counting viewers in England in the coming days.
"According to me, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But now there are six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are doing our best to do so.
Trust me, at the time of the substitution, there's a lot of background text and everything is not educated.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, this will never happen again.
We're going to reduce to five fights from six fights -- as we usually do -- and we're going to try to avoid too much temptation for our fans, and we're going to make it.
This is a state of inefficiency."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'slow' about sexuality
The intruder of the Tom Daley Olympic said that he grew up with a low self - esteem because of his sexuality problems — but that gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old guy said he didn't realize it until he went to high school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being an old man made him don't care so much about winning the Olympics.
The usual performers take this long walk, Kirsty Young, taking a few months off because of the illness.
Looking like the evicted ones on Laverne's first program, Daley says she feels "less than" everyone else who grew up with her because "don't get what's socially acceptable to like men and women."
He said, “To this day, your feelings have become very different from those of other people, and your powers have become evident to me.”
He wants to prove that he's "something," he says, so he won't let everyone down when they know about his sexuality problem.
The two medals of the Olympics have become the most famous LGBT campaign champions and used its appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries so as not to discriminate against homosexuals.
He said he was talking because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and to give hope to others.
This three-time world champion said he fell in love with a moviemaker from the United States Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "I'm surprised."
Daley married Oscar, who was 20 years older than he was last year, and he said old age is not a problem.
"When you have so many problems at a very young age," she followed her first Olympics at 14 years of age and her father died of cancer three years later -- she says it's very difficult to find someone of the same age who had the same spell.
These couples have become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's all round an' I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than just winning the gold medal of the Olympics.
The gold medal of my Olympics is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they'd gotten a ticket to the 2012 London Olympics -- because he wanted to sit on the front line.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit on the front row of your father'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admit that he didn't win," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the championship.
"What I know is that, this is what I've dreamed of all my life--to dive in front of a crowd at the Olympics, there's no feeling better than that," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which has been united with him in his preparation for the Olympics and still makes him stumble.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mickelson changed the part when proposed to Ryder Cup on Saturday
The U.S.P.P. Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday when he played the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to change his role to avoid unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played in a two-year event to record his 12th record, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and four-group game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he usually did for the United States, this major winner five times divided his time between being a cheerleader and playing on that stage, hoping to fix what's making it difficult.
Never been the most upright golfer even when he was at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man did not fit to follow a very strict course in Le Golf National, which routinely gives long and hard sentences for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it's not scary enough for Mickelson, in a nine-day match on Sunday, to face the very accurate British champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked with the new arrival Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American golfer starts 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then the Mickelson game will prove to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understands his role today, kicks my back and hugs me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He's Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined others, but that was the way they played, and that was the way we thought we should walk.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people do."
Mickelson will pass the Nick Faldo record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that would never match the height of his individual record.
Mickelson won 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven sets, although Furyk said that his presence brought some things that were beyond the reach of the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explains.
"I think the younger player is having fun with him, this week too, which is pretty fun to see.
He's giving a lot, more than just playing."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows the great power can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from the experience that a person who leads quite a large race towards his last single match at Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, with the captain of the Seven Ballesteros team holding the top five points over America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the smallest margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get a great victory in Valderrama; we get a great victory in Brooklyn, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we win, but only recently," said Bjorn, taking pictures, after viewing the Class of 2018, won 5-3 good on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring game.
Get out of here and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get points on the writing board.
We have a target, and the target is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying for a long time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
It's good to see players playing in a hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "In this thing I'll never make my own move.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, the individual player will move forward, and this is a different thing to do.
It's nice to be out there with a partner if everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be fully tested.
That's the message you have to tell all the players, get the best out of yourself for the game tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, would ask his player to play better individually than they did as a couple, except for Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furik himself has been at the end of the last day of that great game, has been part of the team that won in Brooklyn before ending with a defeat when Europe did the "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said, answering the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players to the last day.
"We have 12 major games tomorrow, but you want to start it as fast as you see in Brooklyn, as you see in Medina.
When the moment goes one way, it'll give a lot of pressure on the middle match.
We also set up a playlist and put people in different ways that we think, you know, we're trying to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of leading the fight against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players on the top.
"I went with a group of people in order like this because I thought I could close all the streets," said Bjorn about his only choice.
The new German warship is being postponed
The German Navy's newest warship should have started its mission in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but it will not be there until at least a year later because of the wrong system and its rising costs, the local media report.
The task of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main guard ship of the new Baden-Wwerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, who launched military talks.
This ship was supposed to have joined the Marine Corps in 2014, but the problem of shipping has disrupted this ambitious project's fate.
The fourth Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship, which was commissioned by the Marine Corps in 2007, will be replaced by the old Bremen class guard.
This ship will be equipped with a strong tanker, a series of anti-flight missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some silicone technologies, such as radar wiper, infrared, and acoustic keys.
Another important feature, including a longer treatment period, was to be allowed to use the latest guardship for two years away from its original port.
However, delaying this high-end warship -- which is said to enable Germany to highlight its power abroad -- will be delayed at the beginning of its mission, Die Zeit notes.
A bad F125 guard ship was declared last year, when the German Navy officially refused to ship it and returned it to the Blohm & Voss bay in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the ship's maker after the shipment.
Only a few well-known reasons behind the ship's return, but the German media postulates a number of "records of software and hardware" that make the warship useless when used for a combat mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by the crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen class.
It is also known that the ship’s boats are extremely overcrowded that will reduce its power and limit the ability of the Navy to add to the changes in the coming days.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with the bobot of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as the ship with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to broken hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including the training of your ship - has become a problem.
It's said to be surprisingly up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) -- up from the beginning of €2.2 billion.
The problem with this newly guarded ship became very important in keeping with the latest warning because of the invasion of the German maritime forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Marines actually "decommissioned with the ability to spread."
The officer says that the problem is growing over time, because the old ships are no longer in use, but there are no replacement ships available.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class guards could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the mysterious life of the stars in silence
A new research project was made in a village in the Highlands of Scotland, which was designed to reveal the use of wild animals in their hunting.
It is expected that this finding will give new light to the behavior of this unique flying mammals and help to guide conservation activities in the future.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common pipstrelle and sopranos and long - range chocolate beads and Daubenton at the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
The special anchors will be placed in the main location around the property to track the flying activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform cellular monitoring using a gamut detector.
The sound expert who analyzes all the recordings will ensure the frequency of the call of the stars and of the species doing what activity.
Then the map and the habitat report will be made to picture them with a detailed scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes this will reveal which habitat area is most important to the blind and how each species uses it.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of pastures and the best way to preserve forests for other species and birds.
The populace in Scotland and throughout England has fallen sharply in the last few centuries.
This monster is threatened by the existence of construction and development that affects the internal environment and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also present risks, such as hanging paper to trap the deaf and chemical treatment of building materials, and attacks from nursing cats.
Actually, the blind are not blind.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears were more useful than his eyes in catching prey.
They use high gem location techniques to find insects accurately and prevent their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, is deeply concerned about the giraffe.
Having ten trained personnel, who routinely do surveying, internal examination, and at times an effort to save lives.
The organisation has also set up the first and only wild mammals in Scotland in the Thrave countryside in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The farmer David Thompson said the farmer was a suitable area for the wild beast.
"Here at Thrave, we have a good area for the runner," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all good habitats.
But there are still many things we don't know about the blind, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of checking the bats before doing maintenance in the property, because without realizing that there is a chance of the collapse of a cop can kill up to 400 female and small bats, which may destroy the entire local population.
The sheep were protected and killed, injured, or disturbed, or destroyed.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s Trust Watch Tower, has moved the public to come and help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species that we do not know how their populations are destined to.
Ronaldo, who rejected the claim of rape, is preparing a lawyer for the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls rape charges against himself as "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyer would demand the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who had published the claim.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus were charged with rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was later expected to pay it by giving $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram broadcast video to 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, threatened the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," the winner of the Ballon d'Or five times said to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to claim Der Spiegel's claim, which they call "a report of suspicion in an unacceptable area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian lawyer Schertz said he would ask for compensation as "for moral corruption in proportion to the severity of the violation, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the playroom, where he was supposed to have raped him, according to a report filed at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo kneels after the incident that occurred and tells him that "99 percent" he's a "good man" who disappoints only "one percent."
The document said that Ronaldo allowed them both to have sex, but it was based on wish together.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and had made a visa on her injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to settle the issue outside the court because she felt "fear will get revenge" and feared "will be shamed in front of the public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's still suffering trauma from the incident.
Ronaldo almost joined the Royal Madrid of Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant club Italia Juve with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: England 'will regret forever' the loss of car makers
England "will regret forever" if it loses its status as world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added "about" Toyota, England has told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The original Japanese car manufacturer said the effects of a border withdrawal if there was no agreement, would damage Brexit in the cost of work.
The factory in Burnaston -- which made Auris and Avensis production Toyota -- produced almost 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported to the whole European Union.
"My opinion is that if England left the European Union at the end of March, we'll see a stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Executive Director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed their concern about leaving the European Union without any agreement on how the border traffic will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem with what car manufacturers say is the risk of a chain of markets if there is no agreement with Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on the basis of the "precise time" production principle, with a cut-off type entering every 37 minutes from the English and European Union car pick-up.
If Britain left the European Union without an agreement on March 29th, there might be an interference at the border, which the industry believes could lead to delays and a lack of tribe.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies more than one day in his factory in Derbyshire, the company's attorney says, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark says Chequers Theresa May's plan to connect with the European Union in the coming days is "calibrated properly to avoid border checks."
"We need to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy success at this moment, but to get this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio Today programme.
"The blessing not only from Toyota but also from other producers, that we really should be able to continue what has become a chain of markets that has been running very well."
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warns that the cost increase will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and will ultimately damage the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Workers' Association at the factory, says more and more concerned: "As far as my experience is concerned, this job is free, it will never be back.
The minister of government said: "We have proposed the right and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the coming years."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein might be delayed again, the White House's challenge.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the chief prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "replaced once more a week" because of Brett Kavanaugh's high-ranking court struggle, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the special advisory work of Robert Mueller, who is investigating the interference of Russian hands in the general election, the relationship between Trump and Russia assistants, and the potential that hinders justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire a high-ranking prosecutor or not, who will endanger Mueller's freedom, has triggered a conversation in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record talks with Trump and possibly extending the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein objected to the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of the report that he would resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations office in New York City, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed again to avoid interference with the Senate Judicial Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week over a complaint against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The reason for the meeting is not yet established, may be this week, I can see that it will be postponed to another week, and remember what happened in the Grand Court.
But we'll just see, and I always want to tell the press the latest news."
Several journalists will object: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
Carrier Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said rare encounters are not because it doesn't like TV reporters "trying to attract attention," though, he said, "I don't really agree that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he proposed that direct contact be made between Trump and the press.
"The President is doing more questions directly than the previous president," he added without mentioning the evidence: "We've already seen those numbers."
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying more often and you've seen a lot of us doing this in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump routinely asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in an open session or a press conference with a visiting high office.
The solo press conference rarely happened.
This week in New York City, the president may be showing his reasons, doing free appearances, and sometimes odd before the press gathers.
Health Secretary wrote a letter to European workers in Scotland's NHS about concern about Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written a letter to the staff of the European Union working in Scotland's NHS to express gratitude to the country and hope that they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months to England withdrawing from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has made a commitment to meet the regular status check costs for citizens of the European Union who work in the public service they move to.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between England and the European Union on this candidacy are still ongoing, drawing near to the decision expected in this autumn.
However, the British government has also been ready for a possible lack of agreement.
I know this must be very disturbing to you all.
That is why I now want to stress how much I deeply appreciate the contributions of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union, and others, have gained valuable experience and skills that strengthen and increase the health care work, and benefit the patients and society we serve.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie Runs Emergency Operations After Coping With Headache
The backdrop of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie performing emergency surgery after having suffered head injury at 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Coach Head of Tennessee State, Rod Reed said to the injured journalist shortly before the crash ended.
"He came to the back of the field and fell flat there," said Reed.
The trainer and medical force gave Abercrombie oxygen on the back of the field before placing it in the bone and taking it for further evaluation.
An office from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there has not been any detail about the type/level of injury experienced" and the country of Tennessee was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a high school student of these two red chaoss, was in her first season with the Tennessee State after her transfer from Illinois.
He got a total of five tickets on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made his total keys this summer into 18 tickets.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher cost of material if they buy property in England
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher cost of material when they buy property in England, as well as additional money that will be used to help the unlearned according to Tory's new plan.
This step will hold the speed of Corbyn's success in the young electorate's pull
The cost of these materials will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in England
The Department of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be wearing a higher salary when they buy property in England — along with the extra money that will be used to help the unattended, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to keep Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and a high - income goal.
The expense of material things will be borne to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in England, as well as to extra money that drives the government to fight the ravages.
The additional cost of today’s material costs, including the higher level identified two years ago at the second house purchase and the rental of homes, can be achieved by three percent.
The Department of Finance expects this move to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English people, which made it more difficult for the first buyer to put his feet in the house.
Many rich areas in this country -- usually in the capital -- have become a ghost city because many foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the cost of material to help more young people have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of maintaining the price of property to keep high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to ignore the quota for houses that could be used to repair the "household style" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of reforms in the area of attractive housing, including rental surveillance and ending the "without guilt".
He also wanted to give greater power to the hall to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I promised I would dedicate the prime minister's office to restore the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our brothel market.
English will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in England, as well as foreign - based companies, to buy a simple home for those who are already working hard.
For many there is a dream of having a house far away, and a loathsome thing against the eye.
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scotland team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross says "the main ambition" is to be Scotland's manager on a few steps.
This 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoying the challenge of revitalizing the North-East Club, which currently sits in the third grade in the One League, a series of three points from the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last summer.
"I want to beat my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's her," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scotland team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always became something that attracted me to return.
However, the opportunity will come, if I succeed in the team management."
Sunderland manager before Ross, among others Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former Alloa Athletic boss said he didn't feel afraid to follow the big names in that big club, after refusing the offer of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, the success of this moment will be measured by 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, there's no doubt about being in the League of Premiers," he said.
"Don't make it easy to be there, but I might just see myself as the one who made it here, if I could bring this club back there."
Ross's career in team management was only three years, after some time as a boss in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coach staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the degradation to the third position, and turn St Mirren from the hurdle of degradation into the winner of the next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"This may be the crossroads I should have gone," remembers when I took over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds really weird because I'm fine, looking for expenses in a proper way, and enjoying some proper things.
But playing can be difficult.
A lot of things you have to spend every week.
I'm still in work pressure, but in managing it feels good.
I always want to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable thing I've ever felt for my adult life."

Survey found, the right time to drink beer is 17.30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has increased the income of the British public who are struggling to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
The figures show that groups and bars saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but income at restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who adjusted the figures, said: "The British sun that shines and participates in the longer-awaited World Cup, will follow the same pattern as the month of June before, where public income increases by 2.8 per cent, except for restaurants that have a hard breath.
The downturn in restaurant sales of 1.8 percent in June is going to get worse in July.
Public and bar sales that sell drinks so far are more powerful than what happened at the lower restaurant.
The public who sell food also suffers from the heat of the sun, even though it does not separate the restaurant operator.
Looks like people just out for a drink.
Sales across the pub and bar are controlled that sell drinks up to 6.6 percent for this month, with three percent selling food."
Paul Newman, an analysis of the recreation and hotels of the RSM, said: "This has continued the train we've seen since April.
The weather and impact of social events or major sports continue to be the biggest factor that has led to the sale of markets outside the home.
It is no wonder that the group of restaurants continues to fight to survive, although the magnitude of sales of 4.8 percent from year to year will be greatly affected by the current cost pressure.
The long summer season should not come when the food-sales operator is in a bad time, and the time will tell you whether the good temperature we enjoyed in August will give you the little rest you need."
Total sales growth across the public and restaurants, including those newly opened, is 2.7 percent in July, showing navigation at the launch of the brand.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales expertise for the pub, bar, and restaurant sector in England collected and analysed the engineering data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion, and was an industrial scale that could no longer be depleted.
One of the five children has a secret social media account they're hiding from their parents.
Survey reveals, one of the five children -- some of them still 11 years old -- have a secret social media account they hide from their parents and teachers
Survey of 20,000 high school students reveal the development of the "False Insta" page
This report has raised concerns about posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account to show parents
One of the five children is still 11 years old — making social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
Survey of 20,000 high school students express the rapid development of the fake Insta account - a reference to a photo sharing site in Instagram.
The news has added to his concern about posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they operate the "main" account that has been cleared to show parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked others to "forge me."
The research done by the British Digital Intelligence and the Conference of the Head of the Men's School and the Head of the Women's School (HMC) of independent schools found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them admit to keeping a personal account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "This is disturbing so many teenagers that they try to create online spaces that their parents and teachers can't find."
Elid Doyle will be "voice for athletes" in the Scotland Athletics Hall
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most respected travel athlete and field athlete, and Ian Beattie's leader described this move as a great opportunity for those leading the field of sports to benefit from its many international experiences over the past few decades.
"Eilid is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community, and we are sure the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by taking him into the hall," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I acted as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
American athletes, who won the 200-foot and 400-meter race at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta between the four gold medals of the Olympics and now become this BBC expert, are now unable to walk after a moment’s ischemic attack.
He writes on Twitter: "This was a month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor says it's only time I can determine if I can restore it and to what level of recovery it can be.
It is a very exhausting task to recover completely, to learn again how to walk, and today to practice gymnastics!
Thank you for sending me a spirit message."
Breast pump advertising that compares mother to cow has split opinions in the online world
The breast pump company has split opinions online with an ad that compares the mother to the cow that is being milked.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be "a chest pump that can be used with the first silence in the world," consumer technology company Elvie boasts an ad inspired by the music video to show the freedom given this new pump to express a mother.
Four people danced in the cows with strawberries and followed a song that sounded like this: "Yes, I screamed myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice this isn't a wall, this is my chest."
It goes on with the refrain: "Bomb out, pump out, I give them their food, pump out, pump out, I pour my wife's milk."
However, advertisements published on this company’s Facebook page have led to online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a different reaction from the audience, with many who say this makes the milk-smelling industry "smelling."
"A very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows must also conceive and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies were stolen from them within a few days after they were born," someone wrote.
Elvie breast pump is very fit in the BH sequence (Elvie/Ibu)
Another comment: "A trauma that can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But yes, why don't you use it to advertise a breast pump for the mother who has to take care of her baby?"
And others say, "An ad without meaning."
Someone else defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found that song "lucky."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still messing up.
Emerasing makes me feel just like a cow.
The ad's kind of crazy, but I accept it if it's there.
It's a brilliant product," somebody wrote.
And they say, "This is an announcement of peace to the mothers of the people of the city, and it is like the words of a cow."
It's not advertising that praises or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps wrapped in their bra.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the lives of many women who abuse ASI who say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is really quiet, without cable or cable and passage in the bra is in place, which gives women freedom to move, with their babies, and even go out while pushing.
Ana Balarin, a teammate and ECD in Mother, commented: "Elvie's pump is the product of a passport that is worthy of launch with conviction and provocative.
By comparing the image between the expression of the woman and the cow, we want to pump the ASI and all the controls of the challenge, and show it through how to relax and enjoy the full freedom enjoyed by the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has become the main news.
In the London Fashion Week, a mother with two children showed up in the hallway for the designer Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migratory Children Move Quietly to the Tent of Meetings in the Texas Region
The number of migrant children detained is increasing even though the monthly border crossings are still unchanged, some of the consequences of tough statements and policies introduced by Trump's government that make it difficult to foster children with sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and fear of endangering their own ability to stay in the country by moving forward to save the children.
The risk is increasing in June, when the federal government announces that the sponsors and other adult members of the home should hand over their fingerprints, and the data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration officer and Bea Tukai, testified before Congress that the agency had caught up with dozens of people who applied to sponsor children under their age.
The agency then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record record.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or sponsors are in this country illegally, and most of them are evil aliens.
That's why we keep hunting those people," Mr. Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, the officers introduced new rules that required some of them to attend court within a month of being arrested, not after 60 days, which had become a previous standard, speaking to the shelter workers.
Most of them appear through videoconference calls, not directly, to request their legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unworthy of receiving help will be deported directly.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to be anxious or stressed, so that they may increase their violence or try to escape, speak to the shelter workers and report systems received in the last few months.
The lawyers say that anxiety is increasing in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs are on a child struggling with a tendency to be ignored, because of its size.
They suggest that moving the children to the camp without giving them enough time emotionally to prepare or saying good-bye to their friends can cause much trauma.
Syria asks the 'sitting troops' of the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Pideto in the United Nations General Majelis, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return, although the country's war has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces had illegally settled in Syria, for reasons of combating terrorism, and "would have to be dealt with."
"They must retreat as soon as possible and without making any demands," he said to the magistrate.
Moualem points out that "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million refugees from their homes.
He insisted that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until we clear all Syrian territories" of the terrorist group and the "unlawful presence of foreign troops."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, especially training and influencing the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in war zones.
As for the refugee problem, Moualem insisted that they should return immediately, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "extraordinary fear" that led the refugees to go further.
"We have asked the international community and the human organization to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a whole human problem."
The European Union and the United States warn that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
U.S. diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a sponsorship zone in the Great Temple of the Last Idlib Rebellion has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevents a major attack from the Russian troops supported in the province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem stressed that the treaty had "a clear deadline" and gave rise to the hope that military action would target the mujahids, including a fighter from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who would "be thrown away."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call quickly the first new committee meeting consisting of the government and opposition to make the War Law for Syria and open the way for a general election.
Moualem placed the detailed requirements of the Syrian government in the committee, stressing that the panel's work should be limited "to review the latest legislation," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020, except because many Liberals hope, accusations and scandals will end his presidency today.
There's no doubt, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue for the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN's core hour rate has increased more than twice to 1.05 million and MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million watch headlines, increased by 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has sat at the top of the cable TV rate with 3.5 million viewers on the main news night.
"It's a spirit that makes people interested in something that is not understood yet," said Neal Baer, the director of the ABC "Designed Survivor" drama, about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some difficult truths in sneaking into Hollywood Boys Club," has another theory.
He remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give his voice to Trump.
Why?
"She said, 'cause she made me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said to me.
There's a value for entertainment in a mess.
Surely, unlike other TV events, stories from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family can reunite and restore the global economy.
Unlike that, the riches that can only be felt by the most special viewers.
In addition, not only did you become a well-known citizen of the country when you found yourself watching the panel of experts discussing the use of "the background" sources by Bob Woodward for his book Fair, wearing a $15,000 worth of bird skin bomber jacket ("the thickest clothing with pride," The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"Part of the policy he's doing makes it the same as a real event that refreshes you every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive head of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars," about the stagers and the length of Trump's daily story (chosen by NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

"I think it's funny, but it turns out they're right."

Lots of money out there spilling a half-time election contest in the White House
In fact, Pennsylvania 17 has received a flood of money, the blessing of a return to the convention district that provides two prisoners in the same seat.
The recently redesigned Pittsburg District, called Conor Lamb from Rep. Democrats - who won the seats in another district during the special summer election last year.
Lamb progresses against another prisoner, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the 12th old Pennsylvania district, which is heavily damaged by the new Pennsylvania 17th district.
These maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally sided with the Republic party.
Competition in the new Pennsylvania 17th district has resulted in a large campaign fund between the big party's financial side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lambs are increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in the special election of Maret, which was held in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The chair has been sitting by the Republic Party office for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump wins the district by 20 points.
Political experts have sent the Democratic Party a little bit higher.
A.S. is considering punishing El Salvador for supporting Tiongkok, and then he turns away.
Diplomats made sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama had admitted to Beijing, giving some pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and ordered hotels in Panama to host a team of members of the Trump Organisation.
Foreign Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of the US diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest decision that no longer acknowledges Taiwan," Heather Nauert, departmental spokesperson, posted in an early statement this month.
However, punishment was only considered against El Salvador, who received some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, construction support, and economics.
The sentencing, which includes the payment of financial assistance and visa restrictions, will harm the Central American country and rise to the level of unemployment and murder.
When internal meetings took place, North American and Central American offices postponed high-level conferences focused on security and economic prosperity to follow the same meeting that was considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States last year.
But in mid - September, senior government officials insisted that they wanted to resume the conference, in order to effectively end the sentence for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as the government's import signal to the near, speech of diplomats.
And the three American envoys quietly return to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new counsel or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate announced by the third U.S. office, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations about this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by external analysis close to government and by the fact that the situation was unclear.
Study Edition
Another surprising story is a special advisory report by Robert Mueller on the possibility of Mr. Trump's trial, which currently has very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses whether Trump's campaign was collapsing with Russia in an attack on our general election.
When Congress moves hand in hand, Mr. Trump will be asked to take responsibility for himself, just as he is prepared to go back to the electorate, and may eventually become a jury of his peers.
So much remains to be done, and I do not mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's rule cannot be avoided or united in Europe.
There's a choice we'd better make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we've been fighting.
In 1938, Germany’s offices were ready to make a bid against Hitler, if only the West were to fight him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years that follow.
The beginning of history is centered on the point of such migration, and the pace of democracy that has been accelerated or delayed cannot be avoided.
Today, the United States faces some of these changes.
What do we have to do if Trump fires Deputy Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein, the one who watches Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure ever since then reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly filmed and that he is not eligible for presidentship.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account is not true.
"How do we respond if a recent F.B.I. investigation requested by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is referred to the Supreme Court even though there are strong allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a half-time voice to Congress that will ask for Trump's responsibility?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in a long time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once founded my great embassy.
He survived, then he migrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a candle on the table that wrote a toilet.
By leaving that legacy to me, how could I lose hope for our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feel optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers ate Rapid Vienna on Thursday, won over Austria, followed by good odds in Spain against Villareal early this month, will strengthen their position to escape the Group of the European G League.
The knee injuries make Graham Dorrans' midgets can't show up in this first season until the result is 2-2 against Villareal, but he's sure Rangers can take advantage of it as a sandstone to a bigger despair.
"This point is very good for us because Villareal is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go by carrying one point.
In the end, we might be able to do it, but, in our opinion, the results of our efforts may be a fair result.
In the first chapter, they may look better, but in the second chapter, we get up and become a better team.
Looking for Friday, tonight becomes another big day in Europe.
We hope to carry three points even though it will be a difficult match because they have good results in their last match, however, with supporting support behind us, I'm sure we can keep moving forward and get a positive result.
Last year, we had a difficult time, because it was because of my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a very good hope in this club.
This team is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's good training.
May we now be able to develop, put the past behind us and succeed."

Although it turns out that the surveyors have an accurate idea of how they want to be treated, not many people are discussing it with their family.
About half of the people in the nationwide study discuss long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of them say they're discussing this with their kids.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start the debate," said Holly Snyder, the vice president of the Nationalwide soul insurance business.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare your own family to provide care if you don't tell them your desire first.
Talk with your family’s advisers, where and how you get treatment, because your choice will mean very important in determining the cost.
Engage your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly help you in showing you how to pay those costs.
The benefits you choose for long-term care include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that guarantee these costs or self-insurance with your wealth-- as long as you have money.
Show your valid document: Facing legal disputes.
Show immediate power for your health care, that is, someone you believe to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professional people when you cannot communicate.
In addition, the letter of authority in your financial matters should be considered.
Someone who trusts to take care of all your financial decisions should you choose, except to make sure that your bill is paid if you cannot.
Always remember every little detail: Imagine when your aging parents are in an emergency and on their way to the hospital.
Are you willing to answer a variety of questions about medication and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready to answer.

A man shot by a windman at Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a windarm on his way home from a party.
The 40-year-old victims are in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several times they shoot about their chest, belly, and hands.
The shooting was described by an officer at about 2:30 BST, and it's called "accidental action."
The victim doesn't see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victims did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses have been reported by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Earthquakes and tsunamis struck the city of Palu, Indonesia, on the last Friday, wiped out a few 384 souls, reported by officials, and estimated to increase the number of casualties.
The communication failed to bring officers who provided trouble relief to get information from Captain Donghala, an area on the north side of the city of Palu, closer to the earthquake centre that hits with the strength of 7.5 on Richter's scale.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of main facts about the cities of Palu and Dondala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 souls in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
In the meantime, Dondala is a population of over 300 km (180 miles) from the coastal line on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
This province, which is an administrative area under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 souls in 2017.
Andan's economic eyes in the province of South Sulawesi are looking for fish and crops, especially on the coast of Dongala.
However, the presence of nickel development also played an important role in this province, although most of it was located in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
Written in the last 100 years, Palu and Dondala have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from the Indian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami and hundreds of homes in Dongala were left standing.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami in western Dongala.
In seismic terms, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Cincinn and therefore the earthquake will occur in an orderly manner.
The number of major earthquakes and tsunamis over the past few years is as follows:
The year 2004: December 26, Indonesia was struck by a great earthquake, right on the west coast of the province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, until 226,000 lives were lost along the coast of the Indian Sea, and more than half the victims died in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, a series of devastating earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
On the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people died.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 struck the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia, triggering tsunamis on the southern coast and resulted in the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: It was a 7.6 - magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of the western kingdom.
The victims were more than 1,100 people.
2010: One of the islands on the island of Mentowai, in the past of Sumatra, was struck by a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake, triggering a tsunami some 30 feet [10 m] high that eventually destroyed tens of villages and some 300 people.
2016: Chief Pide Jaya, Aceh, also suffered a horrific and devastating earthquake, as well as the horrors of those who remembered the devastating disaster and tsunami that occurred in 2004.
Although this time there was no tsunami potential, more than 100 people died because of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, named after the tourist island, also suffered a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake broke down thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be thrown away.
Sarah’s eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice president, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for alleged domestic violence, prevented domestic violence reports, and opposed arrest efforts, as reported by the Alaska National Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report suspected crime, she grabbed the woman's phone.
Palin was handed over to Mat-Su Prapreradilan Prison, with a $500 fine without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As the news media reported, Palin attended the debate on Saturday, saying he was "innocent, confident" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three minor Class A violations, which could result in one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was charged with charges against Class B investigators, with one day's sentence and a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, the suit is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the suspicion of the attack.
The case was now referred to the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence investigation, and possession of firearms in a drunken state, which was also associated with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of showing off.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received a threat from the AVV group linking her son's violence with the PTSD as a result of her work in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, was struck by an earthquake that left at least 384 victims dead.
The 7.5-scale Richter's potentially triggering tsunami has caused thousands of homes to collapse.
The electricity and communications networks are broken down, and the number of deaths is estimated to continue to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake then hit the central Sulawesi, which is located east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Video shows how terrible the moment of the disaster is going through the social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in Palu at the time, when tsunamis broke the beach.
Federal prosecutors are trying to get a rare death penalty for suspecting a terrorist attack at NYC
A federal prosecutor in New York was trying to get a death penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- the punishment is rare and has not been done in the country since 1953 in the federal crime scene.
Saipov, 30 years old, was expected to make an attack by breaking a truck he hired from Home Depot into a footpath and a bicycle driver on a bicycle all along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to allow this death penalty, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "inadvertently" killed the eight victims and "inadvertently" caused serious bodily harm, on the basis of a statement of intention to drop the death penalty, which was sent to the South New York District.
On the basis of a legal document, the two charges allowed the sentence of death to be dropped.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov's Federal Court of Justice brought 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in order to trigger acts of rape, which were usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and allegations of violence and attempts to corrupt motor vehicles.
According to the plaintiff, the attack requires "substantial planning and early maturity," as a depiction of Saipov's crime done with "disgusting, cruel, and obscene."
In a statement of intent, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims of the incident were visitors from Argentina.
Counted for a decade since the South New York District dropped the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug addicts, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The execution of the death penalty last time in the New York federal court in 1953 was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple, Rosenberg, were executed with their electricity on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of a legal document, Saipov, the origin of Uzbekistan, did not show any regret as long as the day and month following the attack.
When asked by the investigator, he said that he was pleased with what he had done, the police spoke to him.
Saipov also told the authorities that the attack he was making was inspired by the video ISIS that he was watching from his phone, as the allegations were.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, which was a police raid.
He stated that he was innocent of the 22 charges brought against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointing" about the prosecution's decision.
"According to us, the decision to execute death from receiving a conviction for life imprisonment without bail will only prolong the trauma of the people involved in the incident," Patton paper.
Earlier, Saipov’s defense team had appealed to the prosecutor not to drop the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit's negotiation, said Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for 'mobilising the public' today in protest action at Tory's conference.
The former leader said that politicians should 'feel the heat' Eurosceptics - because one of Parliament's members, Theresa May, suggested to join the EU in negotiations.
Conservative group supporters, Peter Bone, told the action on the road in Birmingham that England 'should be out' right now if Farage were to serve as Brexit's secretary.
However, the challenge May faced in reconciling his shared position has been undermined by the supporters of Remain Tories, who have joined in the separate protest action threatening Brexit in that city.
Prime Minister fights to defend the Chequers compromise plan to remain on track despite Brexitiers, Remainers and the European Union.
The allies stressed that they would be moved to reach agreement with Brussels, even if they had a bad reaction -- and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to decide the choice between their original package and their 'disaster'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave mass in Solihull that he wanted to 'remove the Chequers.
In the past, Farage had to point out his companions to be held accountable in negotiations with Brussels.
"If his responsibility remains him, we'll be out now," he said.
Members of Parliament Wellingborough added, "I am ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to remove the Chequers."
In his speech, he pointed out his opposition to the European Union: "We do not fight in the world's war to be submissive.
We want to lay down our own laws in our own country.'
Bone has suggested that public opinion has been potentially leading to changes since the 2016 event: "The commitment that the British people's thinking has changed and wanted the right conditions is not at all true."
Tory Brexiteeer Andrea Jenkins, who was also involved in the mass action, announced to the press: 'Just, I want to say, "Oh, Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular in the public, while the opposition will not choose them, because they are not popular with our parties and our activists who really go down the street and make us selected in the first place.
Our request, remove the Chequers and start listening to us.'
By means of a message sent to May, he said, "The Minister will defend their work when they fulfill their promise."
Farage said that political demonstrations should be reinvigorated in order to "taste the heat" if they wanted to disobey the 2016 referendum decision.
"Now the most precious of all is our belief - our people and our political party," he said.
'They tried to disobey Brexit and here we are today, tell them that 'we will not let you do that.'
He added in a message to an enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our political party, who are preparing to disobey Brexit, also feel its heat.
“We are moving the armies of the people of this country who will win us in Brexit and will never give up the British Empire, which is proud of itself. ”
Meanwhile, the Remainers mass moved through Birmingham before calling for action in the city center for two hours.
Activist lines seem to have spread the Tories Against Brexit after starting their lines at the end of this week.
Fellows in the line of work, Lord Adonis, mock the Conservative group related to the security issue of their party's application when the conference was opened.
"These are the people who told us that they can control the TI system and all the technologies for Canada, whatever, for the sake of the anti-trafficking border, in an unrestricted free trade in Ireland," he said.
“It’s a show.
There's no good Brexit at all,' he grew up.
Warren's plan is to do a "serious breakup" in the president's office.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said he'd "break the presidential election" after a moment of election in November.
Boston Globe announced that the Massachusetts Democratic Party declared its future at the city hall in Massachusetts West on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently threatened President Donald Trump, recommended a re-election in November against the GOP's attorney-general Geoff Diehl, deputy leader of Trump's campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he has been marked as Trump’s opponent in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th with his electors, who have been known as the city's football format since Trump arrived.
An interviewer asked him a question, whether there was a plan to recommend himself as president.
Warren also said, that this is the right time for women to enter the Washington circle to restore our corrupt government, and that includes women living at the top.
Catch the shooter Sims, LSU player
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced his arrest as a gunman suspect until Wayne Sims, a basketball player from LSU, died on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Diteon Simpson, 20 years old, had been arrested at 11 o’clock in the ET press conference.
They got video footage of a shooting on Friday, where a man identified asked for help as seen in the footage.
Friday morning, Sims, 20 years old, was shot and found dead near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul hit the media on Saturday through 247 sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and Simpson fired a shot at him.
When interrogated, Simpson confessed to being on the scene, holding firearms, and shooting him in the direction of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a fight meant and imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player six feet six inches tall, growing in Baton Rouge, that's the guy Sims, has played in 32 games with 10 early in the season last year and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points in each match.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world championship after the team admitted his victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear when Valtteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton in a qualified uniform on Saturday that would bring the Mercedes team's command to play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton because he defended his position on the first two and pulled Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into the pit and let Hamilton move into the den at the end of the crowd, something that should be very determined.
Mercedes walked into the pit of a laptop after and out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued on after some follow-up actions that showed Ferrari driver's consent to leave the blank part with the risk of surviving after double movement to survive on the third corner.
Max Vertappen started starting at the back of the grid and was in seventh position at the end of the first lap at his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race because he held up a replacement to target a quick resolution and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for the fourth position.
He finally got into the pit on the 44th lap but couldn't raise his steps on the eight remaining laps because Raikkonen finally took fourth position.
It's a hard day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man let me.
The team has done an amazing job to have one or two," Hamilton said.
That's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diane Feinstein on a Sunday rally through his village, he did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the sexual violence against Judge Brett Kavanaugh's reputation.
Speaking on a paper in West Virginia, the president does not directly make a statement by Ford before the Senate Trial Committee, rather than commenting on what is happening in the Senate that shows people who are "bad and dishonest and dishonest."
"Something can happen and beautiful things are happening for the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and mean and mean and dishonest," he said.
"When you see the explosion and the cracks then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you kidding me?
Remember the answer... did you break the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't throw it away."
Okay, wait a minute.
What we're doing is... no, we're not doing it," he added, as a senator impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter accusing Kavanaugh of Ford in July last year, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein’s accession to the leak did not come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't break the story," said Feinstein to the committee, said Hill.
"He asked me to hide it and I kept it as secret as his request."
But the rejection seems to be unconcerned by the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you, it's a really bad language of the body.
Maybe he didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense against the High Judge, who was charged with sexual harassment against three women, the president was impressed with the democratic view that the charges were used for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see crime, oppression, they don't care who they're sick, who they have to walk to get power and surveillance," Mediaite reports on president's statement.

The driver then left the air to secure hundreds of passengers on a rescue plane from the earthquake
A driver then flew the air into Indonesia as a hero after his death when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died in the world and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake on the Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering tsunamis.
The storm continues to strike the area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But by his associates fled for their safety, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan the Great refused to leave his position in a tower of strong winds at the Sis Al Jufri Mutiara Airport, Palu.
He chose to stand by to make sure that the 6321 Batak Airplane was then on the runway, could safely land.
He then jumped out of the driver's tower and walked when he felt the tower began to fall.
He died after him in the hospital.
Dr. Jones Sirat, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Aviation Service Agency, presented his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from the report of the Australian ABC.
We prepared a helicopter from Balykchyan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost a lot this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're all sorry to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities worry that the death of the victim will be able to reach thousands after the National Disaster Relief Body has made it difficult to access the cities of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong.
"The sacrifice is sure to continue to increase because of the many still ravaged bodies of victims and the many others that cannot be reached," said the professor of national body disaster management Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The wave that reached six meters has made Palu a steep slope that causes a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carried supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance carries a corpse.
Clean water becomes scarce.
Minimarket everywhere in history"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Crescent in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Crescent is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Ready?" CNN report.
Early this year, more than 550 people were killed by an earthquake in Lombok.
Micronesian plane crash: Niugini water report one missing person after an accident
The air carrier operated a flight that fell to the Pacific Lawn in Micronesia reported one person had disappeared, after being reported to 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated from the submarine.
The water of Niugini was presented in a magazine on Saturday afternoon, and the authorities could not identify a man.
The company said the company had worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The company did not respond quickly to the passenger’s request for more details, such as his age or citizenship.
Local ships helped save passengers along with other crews, after the plane crashed while trying to land at Chuuk Island.
The officer announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The company reported six passengers to the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the order of events is still unclear.
Both sides of the ship and the U.S. Navy state that the plane landed in the wells around the runway.
Some witnesses feel overcrowded.
American citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to cross the water on the sidewalk through the emergency door on that sinking plane.
He spoke to the locals panic and yell, and he suffered a little pain in his head.
The U.S. Navy said that fishermen working close to the port that was repaired also helped the rescue use the fleet to transport people to land before the plane drowned in the depths of about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Flight Security Network indicate that 111 people have died in an accident by the registered PNG company for the last two decades but none of them involve Niugini Water.
Analysis releases a woman's life-burning night-time line
Claims for detention on Saturday in the re-examination of a man accused of committing a life-burning to a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Analysis by the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a witness to experts in intelligence analysis.
He made a big line for the jury on how he used cell phone records to collect all the movements of the accused 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from some cellular phones that showed Tellis to be in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, rather than the most reprehensible statement previously, reported to Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked Sanford for an explanation.
Sanford followed the discussion on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of birth.
When the plaintiff asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
The other inconsistencies that Tellis reported were his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the victim's death.
Cell phone records indicate they're familiar with each other in a week's span.
Rowlett reported that after the death of Chambers, sometimes Tellis deleted messages, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," said Hale.
The campaign is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said that he hoped that the case would be referred to the jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of three hip hops want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claimed the hip hop movement away from the origins of the political message and raised social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have seen the recent resurrection in the UK through some artists like Acala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
The NY Dating demands a couple to attack after issuing a "racial" message
A New York City lover claims a couple because she's been discriminated against after receiving an indirect message from a grieving mother and says she's "other black."
The couple refused to believe that they were racist, and they considered it more like "enforcement."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, showed her anxiety when she realized that the new care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black after she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"No one else's black people," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending her to her husband, she even sent her to Miss Maurice, twice.
Upon realizing his mistake, the "unsuitable" Plasco-Faxman fired Ms. Maurice, said that they were evicting the baby, who was an African-American mixed-up citizen, because he had done a bad job and he was more expecting the Philippines, based on New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day’s work and then returned to Uber.
Now, Maurice is demanding the couple to make compensation for the dismissal, and asking for compensation for about $350 a day for a period of six months, as a substitute for the nursing work she had to work at first, even if there was no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do anything like that," she said to the Post on Sunday, and then she added, "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple's fight against the allegations that they're racist, that Maurice's fired worker is a reason to do, that they're worried they can't trust him after he's offended,
"My wife has sent something she doesn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been rude to, even though it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
It's like a pack of "stimulation," said Plasco's wife for two months gave birth to her baby and was in a very difficult situation.
"Are you going to pursue someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the investment bank added.
In the course of the legal case, the public opinion tribunal has made rapid threats to the couple in the social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
The editors of Paddington's worry that the reader will not be connected to the bear of speech, the new newspaper revealed
His daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after her book was accepted, explained in a letter: "It's hard to just talk without knowing her position, read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know how we know about the great success of Paddington."
To say his father, who was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired by the writing of the children's book with a bear toy, which was very optimistic about the result of his rejected work, he added to the 60th year of publication of the book that felt "sweet" after his father's death last year.
For Paddingon, which he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father's pride enough to end his success.
"He's a pretty quiet man, and he's not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington means a lot to him, it's like you have a child who's got something: you're proud of them though not all your efforts.
I think he looks at the success of Paddington like that.
Although it is the result of creation and its imagination, he always gives praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
By the time he landed, his daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to rescue him.
"They made a call quietly to say it was very bad. That she was very likely not to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said he'd die in two minutes ahead and he asked me to say good-bye to him.
And so did I.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors have been given to keep her heart intact and leave her body system.
He's died some time during the management process and everything's been fatal.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't scream or yell or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers -- unaware of what she's been through.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head has fallen low and my eyes keep checking all the time.
It's very hard to explain, but when I was flying, I felt so much sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
Women who are mourning post cards to prevent suicide at the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one in death tried to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and numbers that can be contacted to get support.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer depression and suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents feeling like I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Sydney, said that his son was a cook who promised to smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They used to say that his smiles made the air clear."
But he stopped working before he died, like he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm still worried if there'll be a shock."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can get close and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his wife for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed there was a change in his behavior.
He's at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children open their gift he doesn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to say, "This is a family-in-law.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was uncertain when the FBI started its investigation
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking -- a time-limited investigation, limited coverage -- we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the "destruction" committee in the middle of the board's debate.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their adherence to everything is due to time.
Legislative elections last five weeks, on November 6, if, as expected, the Republic did so badly, they would become very weak in its capacity to make those whom they wished to choose to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators, beaten them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works in the White Building for Mr. Bush and through it meets Ashley's wife, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be an election in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats will sit.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 voices from the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korea's 'Anjlok' browsers under Kim
The number of people who have travelled from North Korea to South Korea has fallen drastic since Kim Jong-un ruled seven years ago, harassing a member of the Democratic Korea parliament.
Park Byeong-seug, postponing data from the Southern unit destruction data, said there were 1,127 trips last year -- compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the border controls between North Korea and Tiongkok and the higher tariffs demanded by the fugitives are the key factors.
Pyongyang gave no public comment.
Most Northers were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have been crossing the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through Tiongkok, which has the longest border with North Korea and easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
Tiongkok treated the fugitives as an illegal refugee and often forced them to return.
The relationship between the North and the South — technically still in the war — has increased greatly in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the two leaders met at Pyongyang for a discussion that focused on the delayed negotiation negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work together on a nuclear-free Korean campaign.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blames the US for the lack of development ever since.
"Without belief in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, we will not be able to drop our weapons on the side," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Major in New York.
Nancy Pelos accused Brett Kavanaugh of "hisisteris," she said she did not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The opposition leader Nancy Pelosi accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of "hisisteris" and said he did not fit in a temper to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelisi made that comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid thinking that if a woman had such a power, they'd say 'hisisteris'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Judisial Council Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally objected to the claim that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were still a teenager.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and talking when discussing his family and his years in high school.
He also boldly cursed the Democrats in the committee, saying the charge against him was "unreasonable and coordinated murder" organised by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's witness to prove that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was proud of the Democrats.
"I think he disassociated himself with those statements and his attitude toward Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi expressed his disquiet if he would try to claim his consent, and if the Democrats got more voice in the People's Court.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't say what he really says to Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about the decision-making potential of Kavanaugh against the Law on Health Services or Roe v. Wade, because he was regarded as an advocate of conservative justice.
In the assembly, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overthrow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone hysterical and ordinary to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?'
And the woman has to handle it.
It's an ethical craziness, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"As far as I'm concerned, it's not weird, what do you think?"
He said, “I was very much helped by a woman who was executive in a place, who said that she also wept when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started to cry, and she would say to those who spoke to her, ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The tears were shed as a way out of some anger because it was basically understood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a man-dominated office, one time I cried with unexpressed anger, was my bowl being crushed by an older woman - a cold manager who I was always a little afraid - who dragged me up to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a member of a convention in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on a ship called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, he realized that there was no reason for himself not to recommend himself as president.
"That's not a mature decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There have been seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "Sweet Snow and Seven Curtains."
Because it's late in the campaign, he's left behind in the fundraiser, and so he swears he won't follow the election unless he's able to collect $2 million.
It was a battle that ended in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to a man only gave him $250.
"Did they think I got discounts?" she asked.
When he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by emotions - thanking those who supported him, frustrations with a system that made fundraising so difficult and to target the electorate from the delegation, and anger against sexism - making him difficult to talk about.

How the US-Tiongkok trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening of a trade between the US and Tiongkok competition is so overwhelming, and while the fight is still far from being said, the breakup between the two countries may only benefit Beijing in a long time, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning this early year by taxing the export of Tionkok keys, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A very significant increase started this week at a new rate that affected $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all things that entered the US through Tiongkok.
Beijing's been paying back every time, recently paying up to five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
Tiongkok has requested to match the US alone, and the second largest economy in the world will not change in the near future.
Leaving Washington to back off means following the will, but in public defeating the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President Tiongkok.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, US competition pressure can sustain Tiongkok positively in the long term by reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing could make economic movements in both countries more dangerous than what was previously known," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria said that they were ready for a voluntary return and offered help to rebuild a country that had been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the U.N. General Majelis, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions improved.
"This is a situation in the field today that is more stable and securely blessed by progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to rehabilitate areas that have been demolished by terrorists to restore them.
All the conditions are now present because they return refugees voluntarily to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and an entire economic decision that makes their lives day by day and their eyes light up as a target.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million people in Syria have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
Six million others who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any help or conditional assistance from the countries that supported the rebellion.
