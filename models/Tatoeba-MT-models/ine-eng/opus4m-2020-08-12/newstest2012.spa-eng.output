Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the doors to the incarceration of the minister, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison by the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia that is detrimental to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet final, and the Court of Appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there were doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code with which the former Prime Minister was convicted was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
For its adoption, 226 votes were called for.
The victory of Libya
The story of the Libyan liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
Remaining to determine who the winner is
As is customary in the region, Islamists have won the elections, but now it's about diluting whether it's moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can now forget to emancipate themselves and the apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, the society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot even imagine and certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively the best and it probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
True, it is not surprising that Islamic fighters will accept the help of unbelieving dogs.
The only justification was that, from its point of view, NATO's attacks did not lead them to a U.S. general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each successful intervention.
When victory is sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting of which Islamists and our politicians serve to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militaryly.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crossed"
But will the oilers get rid of the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that not, but it may be that the West may at last assume to protect human rights.
As long as the Sharia followers don't cross us.
Starts a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe go to the search for investors
A statistical torbellin has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy has stagnated during the inter-quartermester period, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bonus market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer only fixed in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's GDP by 0.4%
Both countries have made the data of the second quarter public, in Germany it has improved more than expected (increase of 0.3 per cent rather than expected 0.1 per cent), although in France a slight reduction of 0.1 per cent (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-quarterly period, gross domestic product (GDP) has been stalled and, according to the ČSU, the trend towards gradual deceleration in growth of economic development is being observed.
The results are even worse than the predictions of analysts.
Main events:
In the meantime, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but four-monthly it has been stalled.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5 per cent.
The euro area economy and also the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% every year.
The interest in their ten-year bonuses is 28.45%.
The interest of the Italian and Spanish bonuses has grown to critical limits.
The problem situation also starts to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of Czech bonds to ten years remain at 4 per cent, although the situation is deteriorating in the area.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should grant loans at last.
The Czechs are classified for the Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium of 200 million.
The football team meets with the most difficult performance of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Czech and brilliant porter Petr Jiráček, victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, was fantastically defended against the attacks of the local team, so it will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the party's development in a detailed report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, as well as the excellent game of Čech and the hero Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its tour to the European Championship.
Because of the correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured parties were Damjanovich and Vučinić, who had two great occasions.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup date, so the national football clubs will get about 200 million crowns.
A good offensive game has been played since the first few minutes.
Both teams worked only to keep the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, Patagonians to the other field in defense, just what the defence was supposed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray on Tuesday afternoon before the facilities and then they started dying slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan around the nuclear technology center where they work with uranium.
They claim to be willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran, according to all indications, is in a hurry to achieve nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
The students began to pray in the afternoon before the nuclear facilities of Isfahan and then launched death slogans against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the objective of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, would be to achieve, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan headquarters, but also the facilities of Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: don't breakfast and dinner stuffed
Over one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Obese children come from most families with a life-style that is not healthy, according to current research.
The importance of the environment where it grows for healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference, is demonstrated again.
At the table, for example, obsessive children are fed at least twice as often as children of normal-weighted families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "obesity is not an accident".
In overweight families, there is no custom to practice sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey conducted in 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last year's school year and participated in the same almost 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not an accident", which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from 4th to 8th.
A proper and healthy diet in the family are determining factors that significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obesity children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals according to the scheme: breakfast, lunch, food, breakfast and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," she collects one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast, but with a bowl for dinner
Experts warn that in healthy development, details are also important, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one breakfasts alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of the homes nothing breakfasts.
Breakfast is, however, the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children, much more often fried potatoes are consumed.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily fresh sweets (70%).
In general, more than 40 per cent of children surveyed sport, however, among their parents, this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled selected horses (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 colleges) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal."
Among their favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is especially alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments," the final study report warns.
As main food, the palm is taken pasta and closely followed by the meat of birds.
In practice, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive accurate information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who filled the questionnaire after the end of the prevention program "Obsity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases an important change in favor of the principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the study are noted.
Call attention, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would start to prefer normal and regular water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire the meat of birds and fish for the main food and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and the derivatives of flour.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals support
In the introduction article, As the stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals from the branch, how to dress to problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there's no longer an affiliate.
We have often studied with the director, Alena, (there is no man in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone is short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone suffers overweight.
The stylist needs to know how to visually soften a wide shoulder, extend a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks about how to highlight the body of women of the type Jennifer López, of huge breasts and chairs but tight waist and at the same time do not dress it in too challenging a way
If, for example, the difference between the waistband and the chairs is so much that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it is worth making at least one piece of extra screen to fit.
No doubt they will not repent, for the clothing that feels perfect is irreparable.
With a measuring fall you'll feel much better than with one that doesn't stop moving, getting up, dancing in the belt, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to dress with folds, ornaments, embroidered or flagged.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assigned task, I've got more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, two of whom must be designed: one for the day and the other for the night.
The current aspect, the style of fashion that fits the person in question, must be taken into account.
I've been "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I cry in, for example, for me much better than Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will have spent about a hundred kilos recently (please take into account the exaggeration), or the youngest Selena Gomez.
We have to cut them off from the magazines or search them online and print them, and then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what is called the full result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, has not only seen physically, but is also concerned, for example, with the product pages in the magazines (specific topics such as trends, bags, shelters, etc.).
That's what the designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But all this remains for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialists invited encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all kinds of bodies.
Fashion designer Honza Pokorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to get rid of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same dress in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, essential.
Thus, such gabardina (or, as they say in English, trench-coat) can dress the classic with cows and shirts, but also serves to dress the naked body with taco shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just straighten it up and up your neck to get a completely different picture.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What is most valuable is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," said Jakub.
Finally, I am clear why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not talking about the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than he wants to photograph.
So for a fashion story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you have to have preparations, lists to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothing works in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All of this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorny assured us that the image and style assume them alone, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the market have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the time being, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (I just have my skills, my physical aspect doesn't matter that much).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to take into account that it is very likely that they will tell us a very different size from their real (less).
Then it just remains to google and find out if the journals of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has swallowed/scattered, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist does not just focus on fashion, but needs to understand outfits.
During your work, you must especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify his dress and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can't take and take away everything that was there and say, "Oh, what a shame."
"Find at least a few things you can weigh and recommend so that someone can put them," says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the labor bag.
This is fixed around the belt and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects like tiaras, such as tiaras, chitapelus, or impermeable. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special pieces of dress-up front, if this was larger (the pencils and other types of hooks are not allowed because they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
To avoid passive listening and putting something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of our shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the study, on a flat surface, the soil could be damaged and much more damaged outside.
And we did nothing but cover and cover.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the titties so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So he had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservation.
The truth is, I don't really like those skills.
This is only a small part of all that we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedicating myself to professional stylism isn't a pink road, but it gives me exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A journey, initially neglected, complicates itself due to a series of inappropriate neglects of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To a certain extent, expectations were met, but this was not worth anything, if it was actually not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which The Run is added, aroused great expectations before its appearance.
He promised that he would give new airs to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of the show, it appeared as a game that should not end up being again a kind of action without any more.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks by its own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results did not vary greatly in terms of what we expected.
There are races that can be given for acceptable, but in the total computer points are lost due to absurd errors, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In fact, mistakes cannot be even mentioned, but they are rather the incomprehensible disparity of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You'll be sitting on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
From this it is concluded that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even have a remote feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous delivery of the series.
So it's nothing in the other world.
But walking through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, the races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you will find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, on the mountains you have to be careful not to be buried avalanche.
According to that, each race is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you tried to advance to a number of required rivals (normal in a classic career), then you tried to earn time (classic chronic pain) and then you expect a duel against one opponent.
In the midst of all this, the police sometimes appear, which does not make but makes things even more difficult.
Newness is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are many less landscapes in the game than I could expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that makes the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the traces of the previous episodes.
This means that today is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can already look elsewhere.
But a career designed with plenty of action is quite suitable for this driving style, although we can find something better among the competition games.
So far, everything's fine.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same does not happen with collisions.
Of games of this kind you cannot expect to recree complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that when you make a very adjusted advance or cycle the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrollable pirates.
The even is completely destroyed.
Thanks to the restorative system, there are no major problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game brings you back to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each career only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the start.
So it's only a help in case something doesn't go well, but it's not much to trust.
Sometimes, not even reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, one must enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you will find "civil" vehicles somewhere always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This angers most of all in situations, when you see two cars going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent goes ahead without any problems, but when you arrive, you have to turn or stop.
It doesn't matter when you get here, because it's scheduled because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have another advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, regardless of the moment, you will always get the same opponent on the same site.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When you go in front of you, it's difficult to see cars coming forward, so at first you can make the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspension and adrenaline, but execution is so apparent that it will probably disappoint you immediately.
And it's a pity, because even though the travel model is simple, the game is fun and actionable, so it's often not possible to follow the details of what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if the merit comes up with the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that it doesn't stop the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during the race.
You have to pay attention to the gas outlets next to the road, because right there you have to change the car, although in most cases you will have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know about the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
When reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting by car and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, there is a Autolog feature online that compares your results to those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the metro tunnel (pass), where you get to run dark through the roads (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, you get the train from the subway and you get ahead without much.
In the drafting we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game none thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most of the pleasant cases, sometimes even superlative.
It is a pity, then, that in tense times the quality of the image is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This affects especially accidents where many participants are involved, when the quality of the image continues to be invalid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each one of his parents and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game is avoided absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have trouble saying that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
Gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
Fun is assured, but prepared because mistakes will strike you in the eyes with the strength of a reflector at the airport.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativity and Eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a quarter."
"It will take five, six years, before the situation is a bit stable, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the EU, began her conference at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How can you not take your motto 'clear and open about Europe', which you said in the first part of your conference, when you were able to describe each EU body and its relations with such clarity and clarity, because it would be the envy of many speakers from the U. Carolina Faculty of Law.
Vice-President Herman van Rompuy also considered the work of the new permanent President of the European Council:
"The first comes the criticism, that if it is insulting, a gray official, capable of taking on any role, but I have to say that it left everyone confused, because it takes on its roles to perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a very clear view of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of Foreign and Security Policy is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards unification and clarification of the political union of States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban the cheese from Olomouc
Vicenova has also dealt with the next agenda, followed and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech Presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organised a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the Ambassador's words, "a good abortion", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, the EU budget must be approved for seven years, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and which countries will receive less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled her main mottos, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreignisms, or jargas that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the peppers are not really invented the curved or round peppers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban the cheese from Olomouc?"
It also aims to benefit more from the EU environment and to bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
Europe is expecting us at speeds
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptic and people are more likely to see the negative aspects than the positive ones.
He also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
Guilt is a lot of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, emphasis was placed on the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Polish and Hungarian come to me and approach me a Slovak, a Frenchman beside me says to me, 'What, have you already remained, those of the Visegrad Group?', and it is seen that he does not do any grace to him."
In the future, according to Vicenova, the EU is expected to have new tough budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of both speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only those countries that want and those who do not want to stay out of the country should cooperate."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe at both speeds," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the EU as a whole should be debated among Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Fire story:
The innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that would define IBM's strategy very precisely, the closest would be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, it has been over a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation of this long-termist character was placed by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already learned the motto that many of the world’s problems have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which he will build the life of the future giant (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully raised business culture.
"For us, IBM involves a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because he remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around him.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company during his birthday.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the contractor of Batà in Chequia (the employees of IBM were the first US workers to enjoy paid holidays, safe, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated payroll system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication maintains IBM in relation to the client.
From the beginning, the company was supposed to discover talents (if it was one of the first world companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
On the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, which will replace Palmisano the year a woman comes: Virginia Romantty.
She has been working for 30 years in IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the last few years IBM has participated in so-called virtual encounters, a rain of online ideas, which arise infinity from future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that they have ideas, as almost half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM has maintained an institutional concept more than a technological company," says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that is trying to solve business problems for technology users," said George Colony of the Forrester Research Consultant.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Grand Verde" - as it is known in the United States family because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies in the last hundred years.
It is possible that the most versatile technology company (developing both equipment and software, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It provides the highest number of patents from all US technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Their inventions include automatic cashiers, payment cards, financial wallets, bar codes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill $220 billion this year. This year has become the second technology firm for market capitalization (the first one is Apple), when it first moved to Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the customer's taste and time (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Online Services Prodigy or PC computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its foundations on other platforms (and also, if it does not work, abandon them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively on Windows.
Future Technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, about one fifth of which are programmes and another fifth of equipment.
In 1990, however, the teams represented more than half the quota of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets at a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have been followed since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first appeared.
IBM acts according to the assumptions of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the great economic crisis of 29th.
It seems that IBM has been able to understand the crisis so far.
The value of IBM's actions since the beginning of 2008 has increased strategically to 120%, and the net profit of the company has not ceased to increase.
IBM's currency is to change everything, except for its value.
So you can expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will survive.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name is Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 - originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis that led to the birth of IBM comes from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He owned inventions such as the famous "relay of filing", which allows him to control the entry and exit of the employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory board.
Flint set up the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are maintained).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, started with the production and sale of all kinds of machinery for business, from meat cutters and cheese to register boxes.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, the billing doubled to $9 million and started the company's large expansion by continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years later, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, staff and IBM computers helped NASA to guide flights to space (Mercury, Saturn and the famous flight to the Moon in 1969).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "peces", which established the standard of computers of that time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer full advice and services of added value.
The strategy IBM has paid for these past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances, for example, in relation to the transport and administration of cities have not been improved.
For the trade sector, IBM presented not long ago the Smart Commerce platform that allows retailers to manage the full commercial cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia since then, the first country he had in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, the IBM ČR also operates the strategic externalization centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague. There is also a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rhythrář about your unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that ass, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has laid down clear rules for life in the future.
"People can come home, but no longer like my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová accepted Bartošové in her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved 30 days after Ríčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychatár doesn't care who's in charge of his wife.
If one day Rychtář broke with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw it away."
"But here I would live, not as my dear old drunk who was wrong, but as a man to whom certain ties join me," said Rychtářová, adding that she had already disengaged her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph still doesn't care that his wife has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company remains in force, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make purchases."
"Darina and I talked normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," said Rychtář.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he wouldn't oppose it.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Iveta, and I take full responsibility," Joseph concludes.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical female vices, in general each will appoint them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that can cause men to inherit blood?
Go shopping
Do you blame your average orange that depends on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one trapper a week?
Do you like to buy often in the lows?
Then in your case it can be said that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for purchases, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk through the clothing shops without further ado, find well adjusted clothes and then try them all in the testator (ideally in all different colors)?
Although most women go shopping is a time of adventure, for men it can almost become a hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner that you better wait in front of the door.
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I'd need to slow down at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like it?"
Don't these phrases sound good to you?
What is it?
Then she is one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to listening to your spouse complain all the time of your physical appearance.
Strong sex is also agreed that the more complaints are made, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning first
It's like an infinity uncle.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, rub the floor, remove the dust, rub the tub and all that at least twice a week.
Does he blame his spouse for having walked the clean soil with a dirty foot, his children who have sucked a newly cleaned sink and a glass door stand that cost him so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not occupy themselves as primary in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make unfavourable comments
"The used socks are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put on those used socks tomorrow, too."
"The wet trap is not left on the ground!"
If you make those comets to your couple more times a day, you know that this will get you out of your boxes.
Of course. You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men were to assume this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Columinies and Chismes
Some women are also subjected to slander, harassment, but also to insults and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
To the best of each of us, a small and harmless chism is sometimes escaped.
With your hand in your heart, this is true of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are chismous women who are not controlled, who love to whisper and often do so, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female labor team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
The leading hockey player Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in the Carolina Box and again put the Czech players in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play and took another step and was declared the best player of the party.
Two assistances were awarded in the party and also Jakub Voráček's partner Jágr.
After the meeting, Jágr claimed to the overseas journalists that Giroux had preached a great night.
"Before the party, I told you I'd be tripled."
"I was presenting him."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first flight of the Flyers.
A while later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček was made with the disc behind the Hurricane gate and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second party already dominated the Flyers.
Especially for Giroux.
After working with Jágr, he scored the third goal, after his shot collapsed through Wayne Simmonds' doorway.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the bowl, but he's probably among the three best," Jagr said to his head.
"I would never have happened that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very happy about that."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at the NHL, my partners were playing for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again from Dwyer, from Penalti, to a distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, even though they ended up out against two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"It cleared the record, I took the speed and read went to the most distant part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the party's last goal as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has become the head of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špapaek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third, he withdrew for injury at the top of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec didn't know how to use one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We only played the game with a veteran player, the rest were novels."
"At last, but it is that nothing can be done against that, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"As much as rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so let's leave gaps," explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban.
Porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed with thirty interventions by Winnipeg in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were marked by five players who thus ended up with a series of victories that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorised state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recreation and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases travel only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very limited.
Czech tourists were therefore on holiday to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime turned to the west and the journeys of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at that time, but one should put on the queue with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "known well-known" in the agency.
Still wasn't all earned.
The so-called "change promise" that was the condition for travel to the West was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without exchange guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The large majority of the Czechs spent their vacations in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs would buy. This custom still persists.
The way of travel of the Czechs has suffered a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 it was no longer for us to spend vacations in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It turns out in a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that to the currently favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia since then.
In the early 1990s, visa exemption was imposed to travel to neighbouring Western European States, causing a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovakians, for a long time, did not see the trips to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least one moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czech groups slept in the parks in campaign shops, as our incomes then did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was taking with you food (contained, embittered, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it also average wages, which in around 1997 led to an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in the demand for travel, agencies started regularly from 1997 to prepare travel using charter flights, which made it incredible to lower the prices of travel compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90s last century, the Czechs had already traveled without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which further simplified our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutional tourism took place in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have made distant and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States eliminated visas for Czech tourists, thereby becoming among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head on travel abroad, including the expenses on the residence site.
Called the General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up dead again.
For almost five months now, Czech football has been without president and it is likely that Ivan Haszek's successor, President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), will not be known even after the next Extraordinary General Assembly, which will take place this Thursday in Nymburg.
In fact, there has not yet been an agreement on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, no vote can be taken even to elect one of the three candidates.
The people interested in chairing Czech football are Jindřich Rijkl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paklík.
Hasek gave up his position in June, not without calling on his colleagues to find a strong person who is supposed to deal with football in the future.
However, after the Hasek era ended, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This remained evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dóm), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only with regard to the method of election.
There was no consensus, even with regard to whom the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that point on and due to this single point, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which states that representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
Further light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee, which, at its regular or extraordinary meetings, had basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a few times already, but the neurological point remains the same.
The question is this: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead point?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FACHR, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, the third round will win that candidate with a higher percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his application.
The Moravia Region is prepared to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total vote rate in both federations.
However, the Bohemian party imposes the condition that the winner should, according to these percentage calculations, have at least two thirds of the majority.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," as Svoboda understands the objections of the Morava party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote in accordance with the applicable statutes.
Tomas Paklík is also surprisingly agreed, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statute of all candidates are more appropriate to Pelta.
"I'd like you to vote as high as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"That no nonsense be invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who was first nominated as a candidate and directed his comments primarily against Pelta.
Pelta's still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be reconciled with today's party of our national team at the European Championship.
"Football will again become a protagonist, and thus will be more cooperative," says Jablonice's representative, who among the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at the professional and regional levels.
Rijkl is the most repulsive.
"I hope an agreement is reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockage of the General Assembly."
"At any rate, I hope the common sense will be imposed," said Rijkl.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, on which they had to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport the Executive Committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decision-making meeting could finally be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister for Education, Youth and Sports, would like to incorporate the parts divided into the country's most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovakian Sport Federation (ČSTV) which will try to provide a new direction for Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Tomasz Paklik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate to satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not be presented as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was an appropriate person, I would be fighting for her and not presenting myself as a candidate for the elections."
"But to this day such a person has not been found," Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rijkl is precisely the possibility of blocking Pelta, the so-called winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, in the event of victory, he would remain in office as President only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I could take into account."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that they don't even want to be identified with Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change that vision," he added.
What is supposed to be most disturbing to Paclík at this moment is Pelta's relationship with the President of Pilsen Roman Berbr's Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past known outside the coin as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"If you win, you'd keep the current status and nothing in football will change."
"With Berbra's support, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclík said.
He also mentioned the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta was convicted.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring the victory of Pelta."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paklík, who also takes with certain caution his previous statement that "the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta would become president".
In the case of winning the Thursday elections, Paclík could focus on cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion, the other candidate, Rijkl, was supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as manager of an association."
"I also don't put my noses where I don't feel capable," said Paklík, who in September gave much attention to supporting the suspension of the Committee of Arbitrators chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It uses its management capabilities for private companies, since last summer it is also the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the triumph in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and to contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeals committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to make more money for the sport of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key problems that the new president should be committed to."
"If they increase gambling taxes, as the political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he said.
In addition, Paclík now does not even consider his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FACHR must be "non-participating".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rijkl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see the sense of hypocritically giving up my actions at the Pilsen Club to another person and then going back there after a year and a half," Paklík said.
Pelta promised FACHR new statutes that would end with the dead end of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if he was elected, he would ensure that FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve the disputes about the electoral rules in the future.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburg, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case he was elected, on representation and fundraising.
He decided to take part in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month delay could be good for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels have been dealing with football for a long time and expect to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Spartan and the Association Executive Committee.
For this reason, you think you have enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current electoral problems is the euphoria that reigned in Ivan Haszek's time.
"Unfortunately, the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought were adopted in the General Assembly in June."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
The re-adjustment of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a signpost for the benefit of delegates.
"If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am prepared to respond if this fails."
"It is a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, try not to interfere with your opponents.
In the past he had already warned that he was working with Henry Rijkl, whom he respected for his legal training, and was aware that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
He had long been without attacking Thomas Paclík who, contrary to Pelta, did not give up title with his head.
"It's been more than a year in the football world, and it's already made some progress."
"His attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remained faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the top.
The latter should be escaped from the promotion of football.
"Also, I would try to solve all the scandals that occurred because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal modification of the template.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervous system prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are being staged in front of the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburg.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"The football needs credibility, which will only be recovered if you finally have a leader," two days before the most decisive day in your representative's career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rijkl promises, that under his leadership, the FACHR would begin to work with a desire.
If the current Vice-President, Jindrich Rijkl, was elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association in the fourth General Assembly, many people would certainly be reluctant.
Rijkl promises that if he was elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It also undertakes to resolve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, make more money for football and continue the work initiated by former President Ivan Haszek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself completely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, passing through professional football or training of high-performance young footballers."
"With this I don't mean I'd do it all alone," said Rijk in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can be dedicated to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, continue with a lot of momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not presenting itself as a candidate again.
"Everyone knows what 20 hours a day work."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent and impede me every step of the way," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me I shouldn't give up, because then they would give up the others too."
"It's about having faith not to give up like that, no more," he said.
According to them, it also motivates you to continue the work that has already begun with Hasek.
"During those two years, a great deal of work has been completed that I don't want to lose now."
"There are processes that have begun and will have effect within a couple of years and I would not like someone to have the parents," he announced concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before the Hasek era.
"I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
"He is behind him above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few elected."
"I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be a target."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's how everyone will feel and not just the elected," said Rijkl.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Even though some people try to say the opposite, I have in mind to do as much for Moravia as possible."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another Moravia, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would be no current situation where we have only three Moravia teams, which is a problem for young Moravia players," said Rijkl.
Although Tomaš Paklík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined in the fight for presidential elections, Rijkl did not stop believing in his possibility of being elected.
"I still feel a strong support for the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice-president and knows that there are clear successes behind me," said Rijkl, whose successes include the saving of a dozen million crowns of unfavourable contracts, the negotiations on television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of the guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "unqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Haszek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing pattern in the committees."
"I don't want to use that for my own good," she evaluates her rivals, Rijkl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Blue Jump
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible sight, lovely bathrooms in Budapest: Anyone who visits Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where you can find the best wellbeing in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip last year and a half, there was something he couldn't miss in his luggage, a bathroom.
Backdrop on the water, he looked at the dome artist on the top, he was swimming towards the marble angels, who were waiting for him on the edge of the pool, and he was amazed at the modernist covered pool restored mediculously.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his book at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectonic historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presented them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the swimming pools in Munich, the historical bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "hormigon constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "journey through the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe" in 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the bathroom culture.
He doesn't want anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that the bath fans have to conform to blue tiles and chlorine yeast, while the fans can breathe the fascinating smell of the bees forests or listen to the cheerful trains of the birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The capote in the pool and the ethereal oil of the sauna. The factor of well-being in the pools is so great because they care for all the senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder exerts himself, the covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "In the bathrooms there is a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
It all folds optically: the high boobs, the blues of colors, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of very interesting data on architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly gives you the desire to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the specimens highlighted in his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, the water with nitrates is found in a unique karstic cave (baths in caves in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some terms, whose pools are of alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools found in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city is looking at Zurich's roofed swimming pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which you can observe the practice in the ski trails.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Langenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral looks like an oval that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs, steam rises in winter, while deep mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the chlorine smell in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulfur, in the bathrooms of Arpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gas oil plague is so strong that people believe it has arrived at a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose legume clings to the skin when entering the pool, a special enjoyment of wellness.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and sunbathings in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he met with a blocked ground.
The bathroom of 1902 by architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the demolished windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the disease grow between the tiles.
The decadence stood in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three construction phases after themselves; not only neo-romanic elements of their construction times can be discovered in 1844, if not also an Arab Alhambra-style hall, added in 1900.
Since its modest modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural in the Black Forest.
"He deserves a lot to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In a palace such immersion in the thermal pool seems to be of little importance.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, it is clear, according to one study, that 84 percent of Germans do not think it acceptable for banks to speculate about agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity stock exchanges raise prices, and banks assume responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer's campaign is directed specifically to Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although the large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, the bets on raw materials were designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have been disconnected from bids and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann responded to criticisms differently than US competitors: he promised to review the claims and said that no business "is worth compromising the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The growing food price bets show in a particularly drastic way how dissipated banks are currently damaging public welfare."
Ackermann is located as the largest banker, especially in obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money at risk for food price bets," Bode said.
"No matter if Ackermann deals with the subject of people who are starving or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the president of the Board of Directors would change something different from what is planned in the Board of Directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation, you can perfect your image.
And you just need to care about possible losses, that's what your successor will do.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were set.
Many bank clients have shown personal consequences when they discover that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out from agricultural speculation.
43 per cent would dismiss such a bank to its acquaintances, 49 per cent would request, after considering, cancel its account and switch to another institution.
House 21 in Vienna
The moved flag
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with high places and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 received awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.
Now it reopens as an exhibition house.
The architecture of modern post-gerra passions, clear shapes, crystal halls, courageous curves and new construction materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, so that the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels universal exhibition is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pabellon then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
Construction is currently considered a contemporary hit of architecture.
He made the architect so known that he also built the pavilion of Austria in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flat building in Munich, it became internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garden next to the southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and inside a museum of the 20th century was opened, the "house 20" was called.
The building was suitable but lacked adequate space and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, not a good environment.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is falling ever more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere Museum was opened, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a hit of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, has reached a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, an artist's ice skater in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and the founder director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, made reforms with the insistence of monuments politicians and defenders, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba from the homonymous foundation are exposed, there should be a cafeteria and a library and also an office building.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to make.
Not only because he reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna significantly, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "important and huge place", in which he contemplated "almost all weekends" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his exchange of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy devourer," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, a reinforced insulating crystal with glass fibre was installed and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety crystal.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descends between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors remain, the house is painted in old caoba tones and protected from oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly what it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find materials that were good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of a hard soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The flag "who came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "random appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and therefore wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a coup d'état. The completely new and planned "central station district", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garden.
And perhaps another blow of luck happens: House 21 could receive a boost from another construction of Krischanitz, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin-based temporary art room and, as you can hear, negotiates with the city on a nearby place in the Schweizer Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that rises to millions
The company has come up with a crisis plan, which would avoid the fallout of the trains in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the aberrations and delays of the trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than €70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Billd" newspaper reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments up to 2005 of a total of around EUR 300 million.
To achieve better availability of vehicles and the rail network, there is still an extremely long time.
Among other things, it is planned to double the domestic and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove the snow from the roads and the Andes.
The aim is to clean snow and ice for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of delays and delays in trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, he lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of an axle in the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays many millionaires in the United States.
After a riot on President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank has to pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the sector's giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in an agreement to put an end to the contents due to the failure of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA recriminates many large banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks to the depths.
"We are happy to be able to clarify the subject without the parties having to go to the courts," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not accept any blame with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which imposed a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deferral of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of failure to protect client investments.
The NCUA seeks to reintegrate the losses of millions of origin.
The agreements currently concluded are their first type.
The regulator had also asked for accounts from other large banks and in summer-summer-summer disputes against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the doubts about mortgages, these are the so-called mortgage-backed values.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial entities.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results were achieved a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for US banks.
Investors and the inspection have launched countless processes to receive compensation or punish deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of claims.
It reproaches the 18 major international banks that the two US mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in an amount of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from FHFA, which is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The financial guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the company of IBM Information Technologies.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, American major investor Warren Buffet has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies as long-term business development forecasts are negative.
But she has read the IBM commercial report and changed her opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand a lot before IBM offered above all services and looked for computer systems for the Information Technologies departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed in the CNBC economy station that has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the commitment until now.
He commended the direction of regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They have done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
For a long time IBM has established profit information technology services such as the operation of computing centres.
The older computer pioneer of over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he was only investing in companies whose business he would understand.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the opportunity on a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rüg.
Buffett, 81 years old, took over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the '60s and, with wise investments, extended it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has provided him with the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock market shares rose by one percent.
"The Blue Giant," as IBM is known, has a pocket value of more than $220 billion and, together with Apple and Microsoft, is among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
A newspaper is talking about a "bloody ideology" that relives itself.
The murders of eight small businessmen fake and Greek between 2001 and 2006 have a background of extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, fears and concerns have been expressed about this news.
For many of the Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost believed to be dead a long time ago, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background had occurred against the Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-rightmost network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, not much less, predictable.
"Does the bloody ideology relive?" titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah points out, on the contrary, that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Bureau of Defence of the Constitution and was concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the ultra-rightist pantaloon.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a guard in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, reflected on a solemn event of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with happy colors, like a happy ending story.
The information came to some Turkish media as a joke: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also insists on tracing this mental connection.
"Starts to smell bad," says Ahmet Külahci's column title.
He pointed out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Turkish-born Germans, police behaviour and their subsequent success in search are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not previously sought suspects in the circle of the ultra-right.
Some are less rhetorical about the radical media: "From now on, immigrants are lost, only self-defence and arms are left."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany strongly depends on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the sanctions throughout the network," writes "Selen".
This means that if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the attacks by Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of Solingen's fire has been recorded in the German and Turkish memories.
No other event has made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in violence.
The attacks exacerbate the feeling of the Turkish side's group.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, mainly the lack of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After Solingen's fire-fighting attack, he sent a telegram of pessimism to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel explained in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute to taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows again how deep it has been since the mistrust of many Turkish Germans in the rule of law in this country.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive explanation and a re-evaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time there is a need for frank words.
The bank of the scandal of Lake Zurich
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, unless in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went into bankruptcy in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now a German directs her.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After its spectacular departure from the summit of the federal bank, in July it was known that in 2013 it would start in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the administrative board of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and profitable step in his career.
Axel Weber is pleased publicly, thanks to Switzerland for its beauty and to the UBS for its newly acquired solidarity and lets you take a good look at your future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grubel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
One USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and robbed 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, director general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the management board of the USB was considered equally affected since then, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber should advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will be chaired by the administrative board in May, not in early 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and counsellor and has certainly had a period of adjustment needed.
He is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven that he deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the old so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss property manager discreetly and solidly, but also modest, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the big banks of the world.
That's impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent bank professor in Zurich for many years, explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one is asked: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came out in the light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, director general, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was loaded into losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To load this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course some looked with contempt until recently: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative board, in 2006 in Switzerland's second best paid administrative board, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, and the UBS was in the financial crisis in the face of the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problem values to UBS for many thousands of millions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bonus, thereby becoming the co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was affected, said the dramatic that this was for a small country, if it housed such large banks.
Finally, the amount of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times as much as Switzerland's economic results (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, bank expert.
The second was joined to the first disaster.
A few months later, UBS capitulated into a tax conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of the downstream customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with a payment compensation.
As a result, the UBS confessed more or less to having helped in the tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the President of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, within a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: the investment bank through false speculation and asset management through aid to tax fraud.
And just when I was getting a little quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS was getting it back, this unlucky operator's story happened, an individual operator robbed 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it was revealed, by the way, that this still doesn't work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The UBS problem is that it does not dominate risk controls".
Therefore the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers have long been present, emerged to be the guardians of the world's largest goods: no too high a risk, on the other hand, the security of the money wants to break across the Alpine republic.
Swiss banks' security deposits were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not match the cliché of the Swiss private bank, it is only a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Bahnhofstraße street in Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the covered snow peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostensible, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry such as Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli Confectionery.
The Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, passing through the Palace of Credit Switzerland, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather chairs, next to the bank logo there is a large letter to indicate the "safety".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, at some point have shifted the idea of the large Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
She prefers not to read her name in the newspaper, after all, she does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks.
The UBS has become too large, it believes, mainly in the investment bank, where Anglo-Saxons have gained land.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they've been used for a long time to the habits of Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost both money in the high-risk jungle and the Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hassig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The UBS Crash").
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the large bank of the bank.
How do they do it?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
It therefore served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with the center of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
All of a sudden, international investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could cycle a large financial bike.
There are two names related to this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuition that was able to open up from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel believed in Wuffli.
And at the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, the dissatisfaction came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of directors, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
The "League Tables" were headed by the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps have gone well.
In foreign exchange operations and in the negotiation of shares, it was the highest.
However, corporate advisors have highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the "fixed income" bank language, there is a huge compensation for the large banks.
The UBS has gaps in US mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost costs its existence.
Growth yearnings have invested the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in American high-risk investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine for the ownership and sale of US mortgage credits, maintaining certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, he's been looking for the discount for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," said Geiger, bank expert.
So big the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
The posts in the UBS have become projectable seats and are uncertain to date.
At present, the manager of a large bank has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, in which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, focus on property management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (although).
But the investment bank must decrease a lot, it's clear right now.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian Swiss was thought to be a transitional solution, as the bank was surprisingly separated from its Grubel predecessor.
In the meantime, he insisted: He must conduct UBS business permanently, reported Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the middle of the 1990s.
Remove 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask right now.
So far he just says he'll first find a place with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock exchange
The imminent recession in Europe has scared US investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome remain in force.
The slowed industrial production on the continent is stabilising the hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis in its origins.
General relief on government changes in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro fell in front of the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass was seen half full, not half empty, but now the problems go back to a foreground," said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, the financial assets are listed in the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values closed with a low of 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
At the meeting, the market barometer ranged from 12.027 to 12.170 points.
The S&P 500 index closed with 1,251 points, a low of one percent.
The Nasdaq index of the technology bag lost 0.8 per cent and left the market with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index is fired with a low of 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its growth.
In September, companies produced two percent less than the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat statistical office.
What created scepticism among US investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are also signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of investments, only confirmed this caution, it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to put an end to the crisis, said in an interview with the CNBC.
From your point of view, that is why it is too soon to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it casts a decade of old principles across the board and enters the US technology sector.
Its investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supports the contribution of the traditional consortium's shares and makes it against the trend in the market at first just a higher percentage.
The value closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
After some indications, Buffett paid an average of $170 per unit and maintained 5.5 per cent.
The contribution of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 per cent.
The Bank of American's participation titles were clearly strengthened by 2.6 per cent of the market.
The house sells almost all the rest of its holdings to the China Construction Bank and is therefore repaid $6.6 billion.
The Institute wants to strengthen its capital ratio primarily with the net profit of the business and thereby meet the regulatory requirements.
The Boeing aircraft manufacturer increased its profits and thereby limited losses in Dow.
The action rose by 1.5 per cent, after the consortium charged the highest charge for its history.
Airline Emirates charged 50 aircraft of type 777 on Friday and the value of the order was estimated at $18 billion.
Including the options of 20 more machines, the volume amounts to $26 billion.
In the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 billion shares were changed from owner to owner.
719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
The Nasdaq closes with sales volumes of 1.38 billion, 630 shares at the top, 1.913 at the bottom and 82 without modifications.
Smart Grades extend in cities
In many places the breeds are considered "problematic birds": they do not expel these intelligent animals from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some people like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grays have been part of the city's image for years, but in many municipalities the neighbors' complaints about the horror and noise of the animals are accumulated.
Although no means have appeared against the "problematic birds" so far.
The grasses no longer leave the cities, the experts say in the first symposium on grasses in Leer, East Frisia.
There, experts from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected degrees; chemical applications in agriculture clearly end with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees that host them make the life of birds difficult.
The stairs are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, the negative press owners jumped to a controversial project to mass kill the district.
Critics have qualified the hunting of animals by means of traps for birds and the killing with sticks as particularly brutal.
Werner Klöver, an urbanist and landscaper of Leer, said, "By expelling them and by instigating them in a normal way, nothing is achieved."
Shooting with water to the nests or pulling out the trees are usually undesirable consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals deviate, the great colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Helping them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, residences of elders or colleges.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, opinion Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
It is possible to provide a combination of support to animals of sensitive residential areas and onions to re-situate them elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain serums" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against the goal of treating animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can stand a peak on the face with a top."
Jürgens co-founded Schleswig-Holstein's teaching circuit on Ascheberger's grades, where letters inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of birds' noise: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grades not only use the resources to access sketchy pieces, but they do not manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four degrees to the extent that the bird's intelligence reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a chicken larvae.
Without much training, they firmly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second test, the clever graces had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a chicken larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get to their prey with the tip.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four degrees achieved it in the first attempt.
Portugal at Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
Bosniaks and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest Eurocopa 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphal hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53), Portugal swallowed Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after 0-0 of the Ida party, made the following five Eurocopa stakes.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the back game of the play-offs with the Montenegrin Outside, after they left the clear stuff in the party (2-0).
Croatia did not allow it to be marked in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a fleet of 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72th, 82th) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals of Portugal.
The former Bundesliga professional, Zvezdan Misimovic with a penalti (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shorted distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Playoffs.
At the Da Luz Stadium in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a live free from more than 30 meters to get to the top of the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to mark away and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half-hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the hummingbird Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, English Manchester City leader, sent a head to the pole, but the balloon did not cross the door line (33.).
Jiracek corrects the Czech Republic
Next, Mr. Wolfgang Stark, from Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penti area, he decided to show the yellow card to the Portuguese for being thrown to the ground (36.).
On the other hand, Stark painted a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the rest, the 2004 European Vice-Campion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European Championship is ranked for the Eurocopa for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the Legionary of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) also got lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, Porter Petr Cech avoided a possible goal in the door of Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more opportunities with Duo Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the frontal round, very fair in the Chech gate.
After the rest, the Czechs had to protect the lengther from the world famous porter, the front of the FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end was decided by the party.
Meanwhile, Turkey took advantage of the wonder of Zagreb's football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not spend a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his third-world bank seat in 2002, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks almost reached a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long shot, Selcuk Ian only managed to play the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim could not either send the balloon inside the doorway.
After the second reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goals.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who took place in the 62nd minute Ivan Perisic, Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapatoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, Irish have been the first to participate in the Eurocopa since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who won the 4-0 in the pre-decisive game, to his head in minutes 32.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was involved with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but it had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first great opportunity.
From the first moment, the long defense has avoided possible advantage goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he moved on.
After a defense of the porter Pavel Londonk, Ward appeared and hit the balloon across the line, reaching 1-0.

Massacre at personal level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "starts with a long personate drama of the kind that can cause one to fall the soul at its feet.
Here are some action tips: Start this page gently and turn it into your brand pages.
It will come to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's news story, and this personate drama will work as his GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, he is confused and desolate in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you have written here is a poorly current book, which accurately describes it as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "senses, impressions, experiences and mood states."
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines the experiences in times of war of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from colleges and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become mad, or die.
Their lives here are like veiled vowels lit up in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a diversion from standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the war of trenches in the western front.
"Beautifulness and the pain of battle" moves in an expert way through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book fall over the hills; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; Tse-tse flies are an intramanual problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina that pecks at the cord.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman at home with your children, are you staying or running away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why we have to fight this war.
"Failure of facts," notes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and the pain of battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of his prior publications of memories, letters and other material.
The explanations of your life may be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privacy and dealing with what is present.
About telling the story of a German college student says, "Secedanians everywhere."
"Coffee sequencing, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wood buttons."
He's still talking about the next food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in sheep's fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and pellets of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, it notes, "837 meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards ruralism and demonstrates about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are conceived and not for sitting in chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best sealer, and claim that this infantry means civilization and that there is no barbaric behind that amided and tachooned seal."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once you give up the thought of sacrificing yourself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it is horribly like "to a convicted person being strangled in secret".
Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young-century cattle: The eloquent mass murderer and ideologically convinced with good-packed clothes that executes his butchership while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unpredictable ways; there is both innocuous and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund spoke of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venerable disease of prostitutes as a way to escape the service ahead.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonococious pus, which soldiers buy and embitter their genitals with the hope of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often gives way to a blind person for life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way in which the war to "dissolve exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels like No novelty in front of Erich Maria Remarke, instead of complete stories.
Mr Englund's volume joins to a somewhat conventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of non-fiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come from his book, started from between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and he would have burned it with a candle.
After a false step, a planned attack per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing anti-disturb helmets.
Monday night was chosen on Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept confidential except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence emphasized how the operation was spreading challenges to the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the spray spray spray spraying on the protesters, violating departmental rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "occupations".
And that's why the police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of demonstrators was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Agents had been prepared to see occupations in other cities developed.
A major disaster simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called training of riots - counter-terrorism measures that involved mobilizing a large number of police officers quickly - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute", someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"The few cops I know were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter the Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they gave up when hundreds of protesters woke up before time after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved police officers from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when there were the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with focus and speakers gathered on the Pike Slip cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and precipitated messages from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their clear blue shorts, many protesters just picked up their stuff and left.
No shop was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesperson of the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved westward through the dense marin of the personal effects of the protesters, including trashed paper and plastic bags of paper and plastic, cleaning department teams followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move out were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the camp epicenter were crammed between them by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the canadas.
There were no arrests in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The discharge operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "change of public order and resistance to authority", he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Spósito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department detective chief, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he wasn't running the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar, if they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block to the north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block to the south.
From these positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.
At a given time, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people outside.
There were about 28 people in the north perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place in the south of the park.
About 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the top of a police car, and others were seen taking the air off the wheels of a police van.
At a given time, a piece of contraband came out flying from the crowd.
Finally, an agent and a protestor were hospitalized.
The support workers union will demand the city for the unemployed
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to apply to the city on Wednesday, claiming that the unemployed were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools providing for poor students.
The demand may be the last weapon available to the union, the district 37, in its efforts to withdraw the dismissals.
Sixty-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that union leaders described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund by working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that charge.
In an audience in the municipality last month, the Education Councillor, Dennis M. Walcott, said that dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council countered it by saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff would be fired.
Officials of the District 37 said they submitted the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be claimed. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the claim at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The claim will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as accused, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all black or Latin women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the claim received by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been insufficiently subsidized chronically.
It is noted that although there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five out of the eight assistants employed by the 36th Public School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit".
P.D. The budget of district 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way in which it calculated the additional funding for each registration by poor student in schools.
The union also claims that the principals of secondary schools may have been deceived by language in a memorandum that allows parental coordinators to be fired.
The memorandum used the word "excessive" to describe the action, although "excessive" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school nominee to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents' coordinators were fired," says the complainant, "and not just in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Chapter are finally prepared to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion was successful, that veteran dictator Muamar the Gaddafi was captured and murdered, and that the participation of the United States ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (democratic by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the US troops for their "valence".
"This resolution is to honor the courages of Libya when it begins to rebuild its country," Kerry said.
"It is a two-party support claim for its democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of U.S. military in NATO's mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorising the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the Chamber by a wide bipartisan margin, and never voted in the Senate.
But the very day the bill was rejected in the Chamber, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress as annoying enough as criticizing Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as to actually catch grass under its feet.
Next, the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was murdered on 20 October.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "complains to the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to freeing themselves" and "embracing the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain full support from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide the legislators as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the committee's main republican.
Lugar spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other hand, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate at this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded until now in making their amendments to the Assembly, but not because of lack of attempts.
That of Goodlate is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced at this Congress, which cover a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment only in the House, and another one that will "control federal expenditure."
Some of these bills are also identical among themselves, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans who seek to refine their curriculums - the opportunity to claim that they were the "authors" of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can fulfil, while the representative of José E. Serrano (democratic by New York) wants to remove the two mandates for the presidents.
The representative of Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also wish to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as the members have been at the time of proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 at 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Falled but not defeated," Giffords talks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot fire at an act constituting in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (democratic by Arizona) appeared on the national television on Monday night, sang along with Broadway's melody "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that broke his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and which passed from front to back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back in surprise to issue his triumphant vote in the debt roof agreement.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January, who killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang - and described his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "That's good enough."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20/20" for an hour, which was released on the evening of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope".
The special programme reviewed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaven and a long scar going through her front.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband is alive.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A rubbing of the lips.
And then his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toasted", a request for change from his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: The congressman is seen singing together with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanda Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, two hours of therapy every day, he said he didn't remember the shooting day.
Her husband said she was reading to Giffords an article on the March 12 murder when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being medicated by force while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
Hard, hard, hard.
Kelly told Sawyer that at a moment of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,' said Kelly.
"You've only been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back with more strength than ever."
The troops make me feel more sorry than I do
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marine children broke into their seats around him.
The crowd of tags stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as the then president of the Major Joint State, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were shown as an orphaned child," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The highly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been seized by the military and by a U.S. public often far away, sometimes in worship.
It is given to the troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the service members say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were punishing those uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put ourselves in the role of the dead souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or in agreement with the public they serve.
It is also noted that the anger of the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the discussions on the scourge are held in silence and in private among war veterans.
After their two children returned from fighting the Navy infantry, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an "enraged and violent veteran beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his search for employment, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him whether he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding Washington job immediately after his fight.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian reminded her children.
There is some military concern, in part, from American indifference to war.
The achievements in the battlefield are rarely chosen for the praise of a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of rotations they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historical hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged liability to the rape.
If not, hundreds of claimants are organizing for the next.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a companion.
It was October 2008, and he was headed back to his neighborhood at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who carried a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, Texas natives left their concerns aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her behind her, throwing her down and raping her, claiming.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel are looking forward to a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether the claim they have filed against the Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be tried.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the generalized military violation, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, D.C., the claim initially involved 17 claimants, but it grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claimed that they had been raped or sexually assaulted by their companions, and that the army had failed to investigate, prosecute, or give appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he's going to the army's largest level, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is an upward structure," he says.
"Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of collecting all the claimants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, it will present several cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, headed by the federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has presented a motion to reject the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - essentially, that soldiers cannot be questioned by current or old soldiers for injuries suffered by the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court judgment called the Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged damage is part of the military service of the plaintiffs," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them have been killed in combat situations.
It's time the army also modernized, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are under way, besides her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to give them the highest level of service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Network of Action of Women in Service, a group of human rights.
His group filed a claim in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handled claims of benefit for persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate drafts of law have been submitted to Congress by a two-party mixture of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the attacks are reportedly reported below, and for the Pentagon's own estimates, which is estimated to be approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the processing rates: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army were judged to be half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged violation of the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he is told, he was asked to tell details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and the blood of her attacker - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked whether he had had sexual relations with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared to be witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was exempted from the service in less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow claimants continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the George Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What lies between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that it puts on responsibility.
And he adds: "The odds are strong against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go on its way, Burke, the plaintiff, will put his other hundreds of plaintiffs in a row for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we wall, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How the researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type of anti-immigration point of view.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having committed a murder in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: he had spent most of his time in front of his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you just have to go on Facebook.
"We realize that it was not so difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British DEMOS study centre.
Facebook's personal information alliance is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision - the way vendors have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then they were directed to ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
On arrival through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study over 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online right-wing supporters tend to be young, men and angry with immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "those who combine their online activity with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen".
The work of DEMOS is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in "I like", messages on walls and state updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "supernova of data" is generating an increase in research, pushing the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go through the party, and they would never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates all that--you're going to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues found that university students who talked about their Facebook drunken practices had a significantly greater risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential advisors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishs too many state updates with their drunks.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of the Child at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinching" to its own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in mid-2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (principally using information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders long ago that they argue that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice to be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that an investigator might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that took place with students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even off-line, there is no guarantee that a subject of research is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of a user's profile information and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
That is why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper and a pencil are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to the real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social is still happening offline."
"Frozen and inhumane: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter of the "resistance" during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, because it has received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I do not declare myself guilty."
Judge Torkäl Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "I didn't want Breivik to give this audience an opportunity to use as a platform to express his views".
For the same reason, Breivik, who delivered a written speech in advance, refused to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, prohibited access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he was imprisoned under a key.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and listening to the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eyes when he came in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not a mentally ill person, and said that there was no evidence that he would act with complicity.
Some may be advised that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that every nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't seem like it," said a victim's family.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons of Steve Jobs' lost interview, shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, there were some who compared it with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in an interview with recently rediscovered Jobs, which has been launched as an advance of a series of special projections in the major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and workflows of products.
He was no doubt a self-recognised designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a methiculous organizer and a youth of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the albums of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time, it had hardly been 10 years since Jobes had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringelly's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during their transport.
It was only after Job death that a complete copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This file material, slightly re-edited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The lost 68-minute interview that reaches the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate interviews in depth, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobes is clearly obsessing their thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also times when Job perfectionism comes up on the surface, where it seems impatient because of Crengelly's questions, pushing him to go faster on topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and badly, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Job career, but there is something cruel and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after he explained everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The lost interview:
About how he learned to carry on a business:
"During the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs will detail their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disconcerned by the way in which costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made in the eye of good cover, and then adjusted to a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that commercial costs could be determined in detail.
About the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long calls free of charge.
It has been widely written about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tried the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were involved in things around the world an average of a dozen times and yelled through the public phone and returned a minute later to the public phone at the side door," Jobs says with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build ourselves something that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We two, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs continue to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to talk to the Pope, while making their best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the U.S. diplomat, the two were thrown into jail just before the Pope himself was awake to go to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he looked for Bill Hewlett on the phone and made a phone call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a notable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and what they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desk computer ever done".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathodic tube screen, and I'll fall in love with him.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products about the march.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of basic plates, he asked a customer if he could install the whole equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to check the installation and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... I was shouted that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was absolutely reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led the rebirth of Apple, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble in his vision, and lose control of his market share.
"Say you're working on IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company no longer succeeds.
The sales and marketing departments increase their success, so they are the kind of people who end up running companies and the people responsible for the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position is powdered because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the profession needed.
That's what happened in Xerox.
Xerox could have been in charge of the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
You learn a lot about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do that the electrons do, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
After all, it is reduced to taste - it is lower to try to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing big ideas.
What partly made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, I might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with rivals of the Health Care Act while the court accepts the case
The day the Supreme Court met at a closed door to examine the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge of President Obama's health care law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were engaged in a dinner sponsored by the firm that will present the case to the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study the review requests in detail.
One of the cases in question was a request submitted by 26 States challenging the total reform of the health care approved by the Congress last year, a law that had been a cry of war for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to accept the request and, in fact, a historical statement of 5 and a half hours before March, and the result will probably be even more disturbing in the 2012 presidential career, which will be in full anticipation when the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush's government.
The signature of Clement's lawyers, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has spent many years defending the conservative legal principles.
Another signature that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Independent Trade Federation.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the preliminary hearing of the court on the case.
The assistants included Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opposition to the Health Care Act.
The special guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge may attend events to collect funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or be included in the programme of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alert ethical activists in the government.
"This impressive break of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who comply with the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were engaged in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
His appearance and assistance in the collection of funds for this event undermined any demand for impartiality, and was unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticisms that say they mix the court's activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as an attorney general of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges were presented to the law in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying he was too involved in defending the law as he is now being impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication I'm going to do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
The Emirates airport requires 50 Boeing 777 double-pass aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation worth over $1 billion.
Rarely it is news when a company receives a request from 50 units of its product.
But it is a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. aircraft and the sale price for the 50 aircraft is up to a record of $18 billion.
It is as great as the place from where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future aircraft orders.
In a study published on Monday, the company in Chicago estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest order of history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Boing 777 double step jets.
The successful request came from the Emirates airport in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total sales price to $26 billion, Boeing announced in the 2011 Dubai Aeronautics Hall.
Then Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which assumed a fuel savings and a service for spectacular passengers.
The sales price for six of them is over $1 billion.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the increase in oil prices.
This is important because they have fewer chances than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emirates strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-ranging aircraft market and helps to keep your Airbus SAS competitor’s attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger plane.
Boeing's victory at the air fair takes place four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in the useful load and range.
Boeing Co's shares amounted to $1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Sister of the President of Mexico, in the opinion defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor's case.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy to the governor of Michoacán during the election of the violent state, and she said on Monday that the drug traffickers helped to move the race in favor of one of their opponents.
The preliminary results took the lead in the race for governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderón said in a radio interview one day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electorate workers... they seized the urns, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favor of PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the stage of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI has the hope of winning the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have surpassed Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate for the Conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently taking over the governor's office, remained in third place, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize preliminary results.
Vallejo, the mayor of the capital of Morelia State, refused links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been dominated for a long time by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderón, and he elected Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed at traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates abandoned local candidacy for fear.
Although for PRI, because of the unpleasant appearance of the Michoacán elections, a victory will help push the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, face to face next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest-growing economies had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc already through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "noise" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview within the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, that's all the means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In the last few days, Italy's debt costs have been severely dropped and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have dropped.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased the fear that it could push the global economy to recession and has generated calls for the main emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but he said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU ransom funds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater negotiating power for the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital imports.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help the rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the billions of two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go from vacation to beaches and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to maintain the numerous and well-paid Greek public sector workers in poorly managed business positions and loss generators such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis is threatening with "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asia Development Bank forecast of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing the "low risk" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon's serious warnings about possible defensive cuts
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, warmed Congress Monday, warning that the accompanying automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and cause a financial reaction in a chain from the steps of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already conducting the $450 billion reduction over the next decade, but now fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that Congress's failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequences, the so-called “acquisition”, would result in 23 per cent of global reductions and a high number of new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impossible to execute - three quarters of a boat or a building cannot be purchased - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be obliged to leave many of our civil servants inadvertently, and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the goal."
"These changes would break faith with those who keep our army and seriously damage the good mood."
The cuts would eventually reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"Although funding for wartime in the overseas contingent operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and the monitoring of the war-supporting contract."
"The nominee staff would decrease, giving rise to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline in the United States as the world's main military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result you can live with, and certainly it is not one we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to happen."
Whether the letter from Panetta and the recent warnings from the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensify calls for the release of the pentagon of the cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, despite having come to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that she faced difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Secretary painted a shadowy picture of what he might be in front of -- an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a boat without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of quarters, buildings and bombs without sufficient trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her words of opening in the Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from moral weakness, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential opponents."
"In fact, invite the assault..."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta announces new details of how "reductions generate important operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed in advance throughout the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter combat aircraft, a planned new bomber, the new ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat boat and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Detaining additional F35 development and testing could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters said it was the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the latest headliners tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is engaged in the exchange of allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each party is accused of lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for allegedly hiding reports that said a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "picked" with an open-ended microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lie has destroyed races and convulsive countries.
The congressman for New York and the exhibitionist for the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the joke with his dissatisfaction quickly beaten up by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of crimes in financing the campaign related to the coverage of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who would live it will ever forget the media circus set aside by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are very widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given student reviews responses in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Teachers who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we have?
On any day, the studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are divine lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
To detect lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to proclaim: "I have you," the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out deep research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been rebutted.
The liars do look at the eyes.
Not always tartamudean, balbucean, ruborized or disturbed.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or expose.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfaceal expressions, questions and times.
I spent several years researching scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate through our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or negotiating management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the research that the extroverts lie more than the introverts, that the men say more "lying lies towards themselves", while women say more "lying towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than those who are not married (but the lies that they usually say tend to be "great").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a base line".
Helps to provide reference points for later measurement of changes.
Observe the attitude of the subject, smile and vocal characteristic.
It is better to know if someone usually beats with his foot all the time not to make unfair accusations when he sees his feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavioural groups.
Consider these behavioural groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, turn towards an exit, change their position significantly or display a "post-interview" -- that excessive sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Questionnaires often make it false that the interview has ended only to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his foot to the bottom and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a remote language: "I didn't have sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I... to understand."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid being victimized by the artists of the scam in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the US delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline planned from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the unions, as it calmed the environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline outside the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada Director Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that in time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the Department of State that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are explored to avoid the areas of Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquarium, a vast supply of groundwater.
"This is a real path of progress," said representative Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State is possible to separate any decision by 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials denied that policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a statement written last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed full support for them.
The oil pipeline, from 1,700 kilometers, would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For that, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have been betting on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are suspending legislation to force the removal of the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquarium, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project had only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department ' s general inspector had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva, Patti LaBelle, acted like a lunatic in the lobby of her building in Manhattan, landing her little daughter to the point that she was afraid.
The day after the singer of "Lady Marmalade" frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much he suffered "changes in personality, sleep disorders" and "increased his fear of strangers", says his family at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was 10 November last year when tram driver Kevin Monk, his wife, Rosena, a teacher in the garden of childhood, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was driving the car, Rosana Monk went down to the building hall of Riverside Boulevard, with his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Rosaanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone approached behind and said to me, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said to her, 'Yes, and I went to get her,' she said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Rosana Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J in a loud voice...
He had a bottle of water and began to pour the water out of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle was balanced about the mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be held in by her environment and withdrawn to a car waiting for her, said Rosana Monk.
The little one was crying so loud that he vomited, he added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but he did not get an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives did not return their calls to comment on what happened.
The claim seeks unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to give all the money to a child cancer support association.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially when it comes to a childhood garden teacher who takes in arms an 18-month-old child."
Climate adverse events slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality has increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy has been contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated of change, which has generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing million losses to the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of overall economic activity of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of the effects on ice, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage to 582 billion 835 hectares cultivated, 78.03 per cent of which suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main sine-derived crops were vegetables, maize and barley.
The fall in economic activity has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state until November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was accelerated, as while from January to March 55,053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Economicly Active Population, for the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in number of people casts more than 74,000 Sinaloans, an increase compared to the first half of 18 000 969 individuals.
Minor liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Department of Economic and Social Sciences of the AUS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions taken by public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth of unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the purpose of a limited resources by the legislation that was adopted at the Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who take dollars illegally, it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people going from the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties in entering, and secondly because they already have many difficulties in finding work, these people are staying and demanding work sources here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloan is exacerbated by considering the high level of informality prevailing among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the occupied population in the state work without being a worker in front of any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour cuts is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Labour and Social Provision Secretariat.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloans workers was, until September, 5 billion 352 pesos, much below the national average, located at 7 billion 375 pesos.
IED contract
Together with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the largest decrease in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years was recorded during 2011, according to the Secretariat of the Economics of January to June of state FDI, amounting to $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent in respect of the $5 million,143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos per year, mainly from enterprises in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Before the economic contraction scenario, in July the Government of the State requested the approval of a loan of 3 billion pounds, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local Congress was at 2 billion 600 million pounds, and until November no debt benefits were observed in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized with this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events such as early-year ice creams stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including ice creams, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not return fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing very much under the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine Call
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Mexican Republic's Confederation of Employers in Sinaloa, stated that the state must be charged with productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms, we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme redefining the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better addresses the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been trying to produce good results in various areas, but there are some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress in its way of leading public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is becoming more inclusive, and what I can say is that there is work done and I believe that the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
Condemned for 8 kg of marijuana
Five years in prison and 100 days in prison, a neighbor of Navalato was sentenced to ten pounds [8 kg] of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug addict was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite position 80, in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug trafficker was operating on a pick-up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the copilot's seat a small bag, where the soldiers found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured remained at the disposal of the Second District Judge, and the sentenced person continued to remain in the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Should Contributions for Work
The social works envisaged in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not concluding or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, although work programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk of failure to comply with the State Government ' s contributions that amount to more than 11 million pounds in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes was nearly 50 million pesos, of which the State accounted for 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of these programmes would be in force.
"It's almost 12 million that they're doing, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they've had to give us a share," he said, "we've started the works and they've gone very far, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with their respective contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the more than 7 million contributions that the State administration did not make on that occasion.
"It has already happened to us in the previous sixties because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had left outstanding," he said.
Despite the State authorities ' commitment to the delivery of these resources, he noted that the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, had been requested to speed up efforts to ensure that the corresponding percentages reached as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid "analogic valve" cut in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of digital analogue signals is one of the most important changes the world has ever experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes raised by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that preceded the so-called "analogic discharge" from 2021 to 2015, in the absence of a meeting of the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon did not exaggerate in his assignments by issuing the decree detailing the actions to follow to concrete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or inconstitutionality of the decree, and this remained valid.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the decree should be declared unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of the reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and in admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and of all actions in it for the digital transition.
The full of ministers also resolved to reject the request submitted by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the project discussion, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said he did not agree with the project's arguments, in that the Federal Executive could not, through general rules, structure the measures for the preparation of the public administration.
"I also do not think that this would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector would correspond to the Federal Executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the State Rector.
The replacement of digital analog signals is one of the most important changes the world has ever experienced in recent years, and is translated into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Delaying the change, he said, would be delaying the benefits of digitisation, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "which can cover economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "requires the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompassing a group of tasks which the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition, and had done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the area of competence of Congress, as it is providing in the administrative field for compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative Act, has been ensured.
Analyse the possibility of a "voting by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data provided by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes of 879 of the 6 billion 74 total records.
The possibility of counting "voting by vote" is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data provided by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 billion 74 total records.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Llandal Angeles Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, only on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As you will recall, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, whenever the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to enter into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Range omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the Official Journal of the State Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State Representative for Constitutional Reforms, although he does not have the right to "sanction them or veto them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "voting by vote", Maria de los Llandales explained that, thanks to the approval of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of the EMI, partial and total accounts of the vote by the local electoral body will be possible.
In this way, the partial record of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be provided that: the results of the records do not match; there is no record of scrutiny and computer in the case file or does not open to the President of the case; or, where there are manifest errors or alterations to the records.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all electoral boxes may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the election and who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition which applied to the second of the candidates indicated.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary computer it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the political party representative whose candidate remained second-placed, in which case the electoral packages which have been counted shall be excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation the election of Morelia is located, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, although without accounting for the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.

Some did not believe it because they said it was even sailing in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just in Saltillo we wanted to greet him, as the occasion he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopan for his family's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: piloting an aircraft.

Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed in bullets in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in a abandoned estate of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, New Leon.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the edge of the economic disaster and has put the whole euro area at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he will present to the president the result of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "mark is now well-designed", he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a strong austerity package required by European leaders to restore the beaten confidence in Italy.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to accelerate, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonuses at 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were obliged to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronage Confindustria, said to the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were strongly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to have a good outcome," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Central Right Party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the government of the majority of the technocrats who are forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Naples, which has enabled an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about whether the new prime minister would succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the euro area.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections are ahead.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that he should be trained only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties were complicated in the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish rock is higher than the tics
Of the 22 footballers called by Spain, ten outnumber the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 called arrived at the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if the 22 called by both countries are compared to the friendly today, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and Europe champions, number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, record a wide record of Class A interselective games, the Tricolor only holds the defender Michael Humana as the only one who has the 50 international parties.
That figure reached it last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the League of Premiers of England maintain an intense activity each year in league and home Cup championships, and high-level shocks at European Cups such as the Champions League.
The above is added to the experience with the Spanish Fury in complex Eurocopa and World football eliminations.
On the contrary, the tic footballers possess a limited international rock in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is from the Archer Iker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the Andoni Zubizarreta exporter, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play in front of the Tricolor today and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain steering wheel, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized by UEFA last week along with the other hundreds of Iberian teams, the named Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ariet, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly 100 years old is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Follow you Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tip side, and close to Michael Humana, are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz artillery, with 45.
After that, only five of them won the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofefa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rican Víctor Bolívar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
The historical goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa, with 50 days, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records more with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two-decade tour tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream made real"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, lowerist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures them that they will also actually become the dream of playing in the country.
This is how the founder and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade work tour and Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the angelic band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose full transcription is on The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican followers, is it a dream made reality that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream made real for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and for vacations; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're going to be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I wonder because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensively the previous days.
What do they tell their most zealous followers?
Thank you for staying on our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have happened during the last couple of weeks.
We're playing a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that's what's set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How was it that they discovered Costa Rica and their waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have come to deliver huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this all about?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we take time not to play, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten them.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also becomes more interesting to people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think that none of us imagine that we would be in a big rock band and have done it for over 20 years now that it looks like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are thrilled that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the formation of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big gangs.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement comes up from a group of friends and it's something unusual.
From time to time, a band comes out of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in her turn, so we are lucky to be friends of all of them still and honor us to be part of that sound of Seattle that emerged.
It's also very strange that a band like that of you stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is, of course, much longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give each one freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the famous word has not been simple; however, thanks to their success, they have been able to do what they want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew, it was easier to find a balance.
We make sure that you are not too busy to play because it is easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and the people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what it brought, without being captivated by being famous and being a rock star, which none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and we never published a record until after Andrew Woods died.
There were many frustrations because it would last so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we surprised him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your job, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with several suggestions and that was the band we liked most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer in live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's letter alive?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
They're so many.
Among the first things that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so much I could talk all afternoon about the bajistas that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite being no longer fashionable?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now doing better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs in the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched me, I would cry when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose yourself to a family or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated by the loss of muscle strength in the legs, he informed his head doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several maladies, including cancer in the language that has been operated four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and the loss of strength of its lower members.
Aginaga commented that, in her opinion, Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, she said that he did not want it because he knew himself to be innocent.
It was operated four times to the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 kg to which other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems have been combined, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons at the hands of a squadron of the destruction of the army that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Music travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will start a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between both nations and address political issues in the region.
Musica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican couple, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "favourable for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations", the South American Presidency published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French envoy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has chaired the G20, a group composed of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has tried to accelerate the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), consisting of countries that have not implemented all international tax cooperation standards.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The bigoted fountain passes through the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the grips of the evil Bowser, but has never so far done so in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to shops around the world, has been designed from a beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without having to use glasses.
"Mario is the character that has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for that support" , as so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to trap the least skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to give a "second return" to the levels of the game, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, since it did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo gives guides to the saga followers and repeats the formula of the success of previous deliveries, which is that the fountain of the bigote will have to resort to mined platforms of danger in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a Luigi "playable".
Colom downs the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he had treated the extradition of ex-Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States by conspiracy for the US$70 million wash.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in line with the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court had already ordered extradition.
He noted that during his term of office, he "did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and treated all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Morocco will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Strada Morales and Victor Strada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to process the ex-mandatory from 2000 to 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Ministry of Public Appeal appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of boys without training
The first 25 years of life balance of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this fourth century.
This is added to the hundreds of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to balance in an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, unemployment, problems of degradation or in the situation of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The various political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event by former socialist education councillor Ernest Maragall, and the mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Richard Gomà.
They also visited the large hall of the Fabra and Coats the current councillor of Welfare Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example of learning to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Displaced a busy farm where macrofiestas were made
The invaders had been charged 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the fence yesterday afternoon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that lived in the neighbors of the 51st street of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday afternoon the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macrofiestas that were desperate for the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock of the door was changed to avoid repeating the situation.
"From now on there will be an access control," said the administrator.
The tanks, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - carried all the electrical and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially bottles of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the mass festivals, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
His owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has been down 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the attackers of the discotheque made him disloyal, as they sold the cups to three euros, while the discotheque is worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure site had to respond to neighborhood noise complaints, while, as he pointed out, the harassment was not caused by the discotheque customers, but by the residents of the occupied house and, above all, by the parties that were organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The discotheque manager explained that the disturbances were so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he "forgived" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group in the municipality, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week "to immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce to the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant of the occupied building, but during the last months the occupiers had gone into all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some cases there had even been theft.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and to be content with the incisiveness that has been generated in the field".
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police headed up to 35 of Mont-ral Street, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested at the moment.
Park the mountain?
Architects coincide in the opportunity of the summons beyond disputes over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in full support of the already extensive Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some Collserola promotion posters.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great Barcelona Metropolitan Park.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park was once again located, in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but up (mountain) -low (mar).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park gives rise to this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone, with the Jabalis in the Yogi bear's role.
In these were until, in September, the municipality convened a megacompetence consisting of 16 competitions for so many other doors of access to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors in the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city, is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost already a recurring theme to throw out when two members of this old caste of electors are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact is precisely one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and university professors have presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "if necessary" debate on "the front of the mountain", while the Ildefons Cerdà's speech, the one of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It's from the base that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its high accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Callserola Gates" includes a "legislative trap": not to be thought of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where action must be taken".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal of "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that it is today to project the public space" after the experience experienced in the 80s and that it had in the area of the Forum "his song of the cisne".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something is fixing the next step," that is, its overstep.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (GMP)] can lead to real disasters."
More censored to the question, Modol believes that, by simplifying, the Valesan Vertino of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographical question.
Modol remembers that there is already a work done by Collserola's patronage that "must not fall into a broken bag", although he appreciates the opportunity that the council offers to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduit that allows architects to enter the debate, but "dude" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", he points out) that they have to create: "The architects should be just a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question entitled to this piece is complex, because on the basis of the competition there is no global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-sectional competitions - ten - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This results, at least in your case, in choosing to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can impact on program and definition with that of the architect of the side door.
In his view, that was the case, the municipality should ensure that the dam immediately exceeds the Dalt Round should provide, as a whole, an area of equipment to make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal seizer of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him by alleged blackmails
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal seizer of the Red Casino gives him forgiveness before the District Criminal Trial, which follows a trial by blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Royal Casino, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic contribution so that the regional municipality would allow the clandestine operation of the house of bets.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor ' s Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor of the Panista and on 2 September he was arrested and arrested for 30 days.
After four hours, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Town of the State capital.
There remained for 49 days after a second order of rooting was issued to him after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs dismissed the crimes of crime and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta's penalty allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with one and a half million pounds; however, he remained only a few hours in the middle security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was ordered to be arrested by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that in almost two months of investigation sufficient evidence had been found to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pounds to the representatives of the house of bets in exchange for the operation of the house.
This Monday, the legal seizer of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appealed to Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region, so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During legal diligence, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Judge, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garcia Gomez if the damage had been repaired and who of the members of the House of Bets was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and no claim may subsequently be made concerning the process followed; in addition, no damages or punishment will be required.
After hearing the legal takeover of the house of bets, about 15:50 was ordered the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton.
The judge's secretary, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
It shall also notify it of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysius Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more people lost their lives
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others, lost their lives indicate that the helicopter directly affected the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before disembarking the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asphalts had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the firing."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it had the necessary requirements to transport staff.
In addition, he said that investigations carried out in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no pieces or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The ground has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees.
For the time being, the Secretary assured that it was a priority to have results before possible; however, the investigation could take several months, even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, ensured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Prime Presidential State operated at cruise speeds and that this happened in an ascending soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
In the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical policy, the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM placed appropriate conditions for landing, as the aircraft moves towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented low-height cloud layers.
Selected paths:
It is likely that because of the cloudy conditions, the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest radar aircraft registration coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersal of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and side path.
The aircraft residue dispersion pattern suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the sinister, there remains no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire in the remains of the ship.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that they could have had multiple contacts with the field.
During field work, aircraft parts have been found at an altitude of 9 billion 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground has a slope that ranges from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predicted to be disarrayed during this journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which reinforces the presumption that the impact was presented in terms of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Directs Social Security an investigation to discover the gender of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called 'Genetic Protocol on Obesity of Children and Adolescents', which will enable you to count on markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the 21st Century National Medical Centre, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by experts and graduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Research Centre and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
The investigation calls for the participation of the population whether or not they are legally resident, to visit the participating sports units of IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the sports unit Cuauhtémoc (State of Mexico Pontient) and that since 8 October, the activity has been carried out in the sports unit Nezahualcoyolt (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (south of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research was to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify in children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the emergence of degenerative chronic diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day, he stated that the goal was to gather three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 with the consent and supervision of their parents for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and heredofamily history of diseases, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that cause suffering such as diabetes or renal failure.
It detailed that the Saturdays apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure taking, glucose determination, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (it is sought to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals over the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity in children and 47 per cent in girls; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed', the IMSS expert pointed out.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers was that the country ' s population differed from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 per cent of American Indian heritage, 30 per cent European and five per cent African, and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in fat form.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, allowing them to detect whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearms, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic changes and even prediabetes.
The information is handled in a confidential manner, the doctors hand it in writing to the parents, to whom each of the measurements and changes in the life-style that must be made to prevent diseases are explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic suffering: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remains most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the increased consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tumbles, bread, pizza, burger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM Asphalt would avoid bashes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM Chemicals College, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent to the floor were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand baths each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, UNAM's Chemical Faculty (FQ) researcher, who ensured that if the construction and maintenance process of an asphaltic floor is appropriate, the baths could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
In his conference A technological opinion of the baches, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, indicated that the laboratory at its post develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Mr Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and thus the formation of bakes.
He explained that asphalt, the most heavy part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, one of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrades its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrades has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes fractured, added.
The above means that in the streets asphalt resistance is not uniform, but is being changed during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineer warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible flooring, consisting of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, composed of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compact.
Each of the stones that constitute the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
When the vehicles pass and effort is generated, they allow the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it were modified asphalt would spread even better, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asphaltic folder, it abounded, placed a last layer called a rolling folder, which is made of fine stone material, that is, a sand that also baths in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the vehicle beams, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
As part of the floor that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling stock also requires the proper thickness and the material that is made must be taken care of.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the folder and it's hard to get out, this causes a recombination of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of bakes.
In the process of forming a batch, he said, the first to wear is the rolling film and only then affects the asphalt folder, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should address the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Investigators System also explained that vehicle load is another important factor in batching and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the floor should always be related to the vehicle load and ensure compliance, in order to avoid frequent batching.
Rafael Herrera warned that much remains to be done to investigate and work on asphalt, for example asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow for the repair of tanks with ease and no need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Colombian Miss?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not reaching the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valle receives its title number 14 of the princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca remains with the wishes of the Crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to agree to be in the winner's podium, light the silver crown and the band that believed her as a new princess in Colombia.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Miss stood with the crown and the throne, the department has already added 14 titles of Princess and Melina to the legionion of vallecaucan women who have been near the crown but who have been proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rosa Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Ever (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcès Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcès Aljure (2008).
Today the great question that many ask is What's missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained kingdoms such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered a key factor in the decision that the jury made to appoint the First Root Princess in which she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martin Murillo Gomez of the Leamos Literary Street.
To the questioner, the vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I think a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is "The principle," it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Criminal and Punishment", it's a universal literature book that we should all read; and today I am reading Irene Nemirovski's book, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood."
An answer that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining specifically how each of the books quoted has marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony it turned out to be quiet and happy with the result "the universe is wise to pass what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The principle" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched is said to have burned Valle's favoriteism.
A Bogotá journalist suggested that in being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best craft suit, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the zeal of the other candidates, strained the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage".
And that was noted in his first performance in bathing suit on the Hilton beach and his two shows in the coronation evening.
Although it was safe on both sides, it was noted that it lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic had demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the RCN Canal "As at home" program, said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "checks that the candidate who won the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen".
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very miscarriage with the press, and there she was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who was committed to their parents' social needs.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the Competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for his defects in the back and fibrosis that he was noticed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth to me was not very well known, dropped points on her last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine believes that the error of the vallecaucana was the surgical intervention that was practiced.
"Surgery is good, but Valle is not supposed to do it.
His body was never his strong and here he was charged."
For this prize, which for the first time delivered the National Competition of Beauty, after the show in the bath suit arose a cruel Vatican that was performed last night, as it was said that this was the pleasure that Raymondo gave to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, it is true that Melina has since today begun a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by appointing the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass on to history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, failed her crown.
So was the work of the road that identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lofoscopist from Cali went to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4 a CTI Lofoscopist from Cali passed on to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the collection of his fingerprints.
Of the seven locoscopists working in the ITC section, this week it was the turn of "availability" to Eliaszar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the start of his career, González worked in municipalities of the Chocó, where he often had to stay in the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after conducting the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the hair of the friction, i.e. palm of his hands and feet.
The week of operation against Alfonso Cano's aliases told him to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night came out for the Cauca on a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry the decadactic card of Guillermo Leon Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
I was without beard, dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more delicate.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian lupa, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliezer compared the fingerprints of the body to those of the card.
His eye did not fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was, in fact, the chief of the Farc.
Searching for track
For a doctiloscopist from Sijin de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Elias González, in the press wheel by the operation against Cano, is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without error, that can become a key in crime resolution.
In addition to the identification of corpses, locoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, many offenders present false notes or do not have papers.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The investigator told him that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to print a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to obtain the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
The marks can also dismiss or confirm suspects in cases of murder.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation found that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, in fact, a trace in the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, he does place him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscope explained that in the objects "the traces are removed with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said ITC expert.
He made it clear that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective quota is made.
The "infuriated" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby parish.
The members of the Occupa Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York this Tuesday to try to enter again, under a judicial order, into the Manhattan Square from which they were evicted in the morning and to try to occupy another park in the Grand Manzana.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access a court order that allowed the "infuriated" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park farther north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we're going to install somewhere else and we're going to continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful seats and demonstrations," said one of the spokesmans of the "Obtain Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "inflicted" to the expulsion of his camp, personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "infuriated" took place in the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, and the property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the Police came and went to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while ensuring that Ephe saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people who had been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the Police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property area - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial review scheduled for this very Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who had been displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time, and even handed them over to the officers who kept the place, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of Occupa Wall Street or applying “laws that were published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with stores or other properties previously used”.
Mayor Bloomberg indicated to the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, whom he warned, however, that local laws did not allow them to re-install with campaigns and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the eviction carried out in the morning of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were conducted and which was decided because the protesters were "in violation of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm others", as "some businesses had received threats" and the neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction of this morning was horrific and shows that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of the US workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "missing respect for freedom of expression".
The leaders of "Occupa Wall Street" also indicated that they were thinking of organizing "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community and trade unions organizations, to commemorate the two months during the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special TV anniversary
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant to Home Improvement, a helper to Baywatch, connected to Playboy, the wife of Rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be Virgin Mary in a special Canadian TV Christmas.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "croner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" next December, giving life to a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appears together with his husband then, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special anniversary is with Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and is not strange to the controversy.
Bublé recently called the American Kim Kardashian "Zorra" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan renaissance after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still buoyant by the devastating earthquake that has occurred in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo amounted to material losses of $30 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seemed to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September was used to pass, definitely: GDP increased 1.5 per cent compared to the previous trimester and 6 per cent at the annualized rate.
The registration in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the repertoire of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas isolated by the sixth and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared with the fall of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revolutionary of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the keynesian impulse that calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen or rebuild infrastructures, to serve the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has, above all, awakened thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, trips and leisure activities.
The yen flag
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a wave in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic fluctuation line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September at the Yen quote.
While markets continue to host the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not put down the guard.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the rapid assessment of the yen," said former Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member countries had reported more clearly signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates inflation points in the global economy highlighted that the main powers are being halted.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 of August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, when eight tenths to 99.13 points are rushed.
Athens Refuels Doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to sink into the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new transition government is more imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by the genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed on in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26th summit," Papadimos said by opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message leaves no doubt about its position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The Conservative leader was a further step in his drive to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8 billion needed by Athens urgently, and he made it clear that he would not give his visa good to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which is still aware of the impact of the Papandreou referendum's order, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that Troika inspectors will return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, although there is no final date either.
The Greek make-up still has thread for a while.
Lady Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a major global place in the role of Microfinance".
The Queen of Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the initiative in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose " essence" indicated that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that it is a type of operation "excessingly necessary" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals set by 2015, and "very, especially that which aims to reduce half the volume of people living with incomes below a daily dollar, with which the "poverty threshold" is fixed."
Spain "keep working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and take up this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarante the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many the achievements achieved" and "many the challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for discussion, but also as a platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is expected that, by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families have access to these financial services and that hundreds of millions of such households will leave the poverty threshold in which they are trapped.
The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago in pioneer form" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted by Doña Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuing evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link with this project was due yesterday to the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "poor bakery".
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to economic times, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit to be "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the Governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main development cooperation lines".
For his part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the "success" of giving "trust" to those "exclusive to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian-Democrat Union (CDU) Congress in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democrat Party.
The future of Europe had not initially been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the fall, in particular in order to satisfy militants who felt that government policy was currently too narrow with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes they won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, discharge any doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe requires peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way to Europe."
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-six will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the European Central Bank Directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously increase the weight of Germany.
He is anxious to calm the spirits inside his party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But he has not tried to win his congress on the coast of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that two centuries ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for the Napoleonian army.
The incidence of fraud in lows by disease
Following the grants, the UMP and the Government have launched an offensive against low levels of disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a fund responsible for family subsidies and give a speech on the topic, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
In addition, to accompany such offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, most want to focus on the disease-related lows.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private sector workers before they can take down.
Finally, unless there is a specific business agreement, a sick worker would lose four days' wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but would save €280 million, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on staff members a day of unremunerated shortage in the case of low work (to date, there is no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority re-assessed the subject of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of low labour.
"The controls are going to increase considerably, and if someone is found committing fraud, they will have to refund the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned by RTL speaking on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in the field of low labour.
In fact, there has been a constant follow-up since 2002 on this issue and a number of political offensives have been launched that have usually resulted.
The French are no longer sicker than the rest of Europe.
First of all, let us look at national figures.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), more than €237 million in low-employment benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, low-income subsidies accounted for 5% of the health expenditure in 2008, up to €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% correspond to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% are related to disease-related diseases, which amount to EUR 6.2 billion.
Therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days of low work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that no doubt hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the professional management Syria Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of illness.
Another study, in this case of disease insurance, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of the disease-related reductions had a duration of less than 8 days, 22 per cent from 8 to 14 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months, and 11 per cent from 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take lows by disease.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence of work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10 per cent to 11 per cent in France, compared with 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Low-performing fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
The fraud has quite a limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of disease-related diseases for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM verified, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 conducted, that the short-term reductions were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of reductions of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "adequately adapted or unjustifiable; a figure of 1.2 million, starting with a total of 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who have suffered a low level of disease.
There is no doubt that a small figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between EUR 9,000 and EUR 15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of low subsidies and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in this last area.
Papadémos: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos told Parliament on Monday 14 November; he added that the hundreds of days that have been granted to his union Government would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"In order to make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Chief of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's stay in the euro area "is at stake" added.
As a result, Papadémos has foreseen that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to about 9 per cent" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, showed his support on Monday for measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as combating defeat, but against any policy that prevented economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of support from all parties for the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and would not sign anything due to external pressure.
A Committee of Experts states that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee demands that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives denying death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements for this.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This Committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is asked to do so and has been considered competent to take the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada holds its tenth position, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid of dealing with the topic of death".
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard registers Quebec, where 86% of the deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which had already stated that it did not wish to amend the Criminal Code with regard to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or are not a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not resulted in an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted by non-competent persons or that they have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excess cases in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada the assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, in favour of euthanasia
We recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they believe it would allow people whose death is near to relieve their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that the life of the elderly or the disabled is less valuable.
With regard to persons who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents believe that a process against them should not be initiated.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear as the authors of the report indicate.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that the Criminal Code indicates that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee demands that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, except for the purpose of reducing physical pain, be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, has described as "extremely" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help in suicide," says Deshamps, who consulted yesterday on a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also pointed out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now, add that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strengthening opposition" regarding the conclusions of the report, which she described as "a demonstration for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly calls into question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus denouncing a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bachar El Asad's supporters protested yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bakar El Asad was intensified, which, with Russia's support, resistance and complaint that there is a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have expressed support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader who asked President Bakar El Asad to "resign power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bakar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu has regretted that the mediation efforts he has been carrying out in Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, praising Syria, a neighbouring country in respect of which Turkey is adopting an increasingly harsh stance.
For their part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that "the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime has been strengthened".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to repression in Syria, Mark Toner, spokesperson for the Department of State.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the Deraa region, in southern Syria, have already lost their lives, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "in bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns at Jobar" in Homs' siege city, according to the NGO.
During a press round, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem, for his part, believes that the country "is moving towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend its functions at Damascus, which in its opinion constitutes a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not weaken", he added, guaranteeing that "the plots framed against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe has also expressed his support for the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his opinion, is enclosed in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League tomorrow in Rabat is scheduled to be held to develop the implementation of the exit plan for the crisis adopted on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detainees.
Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov yesterday judged the Arab League's decision to be "wrong", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time for Italian markets and sacrifices
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form their team and implement a programme that will include "sacrifices" aimed at restoring the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner spoke yesterday with political parties and met today with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted office, composed of external technocrats in Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a large programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings after meeting with the President-in-Office of the appointed Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence to Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bonders yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a government and preparing its programme, he stressed, adding that it is "sure that markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then concern was expressed, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team composed mainly of technocrats, even if he has pointed out that he would like to include "politicians".
The new Government should be operational by 2013, the date of the next legislation.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain Parliament's confidence vote before Friday.
Monti has committed himself to working on the urgency of the task and with the aim that Italy "recovery its role" in Europe.
A spokesman for Commissioner Olli Rehn has pointed out that "including a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for further rigorous measures.
The Italian "head of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her kill, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "because a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is an "exchange of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great incognito will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put about €20 billion in state bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. NGO specialized in nuclear risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the International Institute of Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that United Nations agency.
Last week, the IAEA manifested its " grave concern" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since 1960, at a Soviet nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company centered on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Thereafter, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as a Member State has informed the Agency, worked during most of its career in this technology in the military programme of its country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that they have again increased this type of crime and crime," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site changed on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, causing their service to look a little more than Facebook.
A new "activity" and another "name" tab allow more legibly and directly to follow the activity of other "Twits", that is, those online whose messages ("twitters") follow you on the Internet or follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they are preferably qualified for a message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tried "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, as AFP has indicated Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its non-instinctive function, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, follow Friday to recommend following another user) making the initiative happy, opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of the big public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have debated the interest of "twitters" with different opinions about this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much to Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "golden rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" to reduce public deficit and thus to avoid possible degradation of the Austrian sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a very higher figure than the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly less than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria is reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay EUR 3 billion more in interests each year," said Deputy Democratic Chancellor of Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries last 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government asked for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an Act of equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this kind of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017 onwards, the federal State's structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional States, as well as municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The aim is to reduce public debt by by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.
A Strong Fill
Node threatened with a new intervention from the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the mark of change if it continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we prove that there is an excessive volatility" in the type of change of the yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went up to a level close to the historical peaks produced by the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually rising since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" in these times of uncertain global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar back to be quoted on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has come down below the 105 yen symbolic bar, reaching a level close to the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was estimated at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion in the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago, as it takes over the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them into the national currency.
"Japan is fighting for reconstruction" after the 6th and 11th March tsunamis, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeastern), highlighted Noda, who fears that the incarceration of the yen cuts the weak recovery.
The third global economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (a 1.5 per cent relative to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), who opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the right measures", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of letters from the Treasury by five billion yen (EUR 47 billion), bringing to the 55 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the threshold of funds dedicated to the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the types grow, the bags fade
The risk of the debt crisis is still damaging to European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European scholarships sink a little further into the negative area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 loses 1.4% and is at 3,064 points.
Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"In view of the new tensions with regard to the performance of the loans of the most affected euro area States, the stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent profits."
"Investors, nervous, are fully aware of the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional corridor in IG Markets, quoted by the agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed view in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a range of reduced variations, so that investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
Reappearance of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has remained at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was $1,3570, a 0.4 per cent drop.
According to the corridors, it has lost its value after the Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting at Congress on Monday, adopts a motion which includes, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish types grow by 6%
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian obligations at 10 years of age reached 6.85 per cent, while Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions with regard to the types of interest of the countries of the south, although also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for time for markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of falling into debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in the types ("spread") between the 10-year-old obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the projected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
However, the Insee has revised the number of the second quarter to a low, with a 0.1 per cent reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are foreseen at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than the dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will involve the duplication of electricity demand by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be an increasing shortage of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
That is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its need to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which is only intended to build last-generation power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite some examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, relaunching the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such speech.
Berlin's election will result in a rise in the price of electricity, a higher energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and carbon plants.
In a few months, the adverse effects will be noted.
You should think about the case of Denmark.
Europe's wind champion, with 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the wind inlet; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours are paying an electricity bill of 40% higher than that of the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not oppose that kind of energy in principle, as the surveys show.
We remember that our country's energy policy has lost its industrial sector with 125,000 directorial jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and which can create non-replaceable jobs.
If France had decided to abandon nuclear power, it would have been the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion annually in French nuclear equipment and services exports.
What electrician would charge an EPR designed to operate for sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is planned?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the maximum level of security.
In France, we have a Security Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our professionally recognized teams are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not have consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of an unprecedented range, causing the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities and French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design that is capable of resisting such phenomena.
While studying it by all the electrical actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from a number of points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figures policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-declared status of France's "human rights country".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped the headliners, with the Minister of Interior (see the Liberian newspaper of 23 May) declaring from the past that France "does not need foreign talent, workers and comrades".
However, it is rarely considered from an economic point of view.
The question is that, on this subject, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone set Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish fountains.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include banalities, indicating that the development of the code development will enable the problem of migration to be solved.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be economically profitable, but it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular those who are not qualified, with pressure to reduce their salaries.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and exercise mainly professions in sectors where there is no employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff demand.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the surgeons to have a positive impact on national wages and employment.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1 per cent of migration flows is a rise in actual long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9 per cent.
And without considering the diversity that immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, with an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany an immigrant aged 30 years will make a net contribution of EUR 150,000 (low-cost) to the public average budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go look for the growth points that he missed "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, only need to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember that, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, during the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianism, Holocaust, gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the Colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and in the most direct manner possible.
We know, from Napoleon's "the Little One", that it was a thought.
The universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough for itself and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are living in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinoid of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
You have to think about this ambivalentity to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer progressing in the right way.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in an orderly manner.
A white signature to the absolute European monarch or a high vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to strike effect, but a common exercise, full of law, quiet and continuous, of options and democracy, this time on a European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we did not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that adheres to the orders of markets and qualification agencies, which suffers from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the team from the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, get rid of the markets and prepare their future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle with this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is currently asking for European economic governance.
That's right.
But to think about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without living like this by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead point.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution motivated by interest would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Only by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty can be achieved.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "uncontacted" chip are generalized
The world-wide chip card hall begins on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in global card sales with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM card phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart Cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of uncontacted technology, which allows you to subscribe to common transport or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year will sell around the world 460 million cards with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (an estimated 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been relegated to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 visa cards are being used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCards this year without contact.
In order to make the top move, however, banks need to make it available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have been committed to systematically spreading in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the system without contact," Gérard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France, announced.
Banks try to pay by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
There are currently few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that are essential to the transaction.
"They're laughing."
"But you should finally experience a real growth next year."
"We predict that between 80 million and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be matched with a fund that allows payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society has also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which has been suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Argel "has the certainty already".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services demonstrate that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing any further details.
Paris seems to have reached a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the passageways.
Rapted at a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of his kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the wake of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered a number of telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates a number of partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, with Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has enjoyed financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex cameras or explosive devices and the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting from Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have spent time considering the group as a community of illuminators of little interest.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in the case, "Western education is a sin"), it encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for the Sharia, while its militants are launched against the evil central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars and administrations.
In 2009, the Boko Haram militants were particularly active and the attacks on the police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, generalized.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Joseph, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its waters from the north.
The past Christmas claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another one in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first such attack.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe warned him against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information".
The World According to Republican Candidates to the Presidency
With regard to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry, they compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simple ones?
Hearing Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates are making more and more rigorous statements and foreign policy talks, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, about China, Iran, extend the aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for appointment by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "by manipulation of their currency", a key issue in a America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to Obama in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns himself in an attitude that "paddles" emotions.
You have requested a firm, but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current Obama position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the deeps of the probes, remains inaudible.
Reagan style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I get elected, I'll stop Iran," he fanfarroned.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations with respect to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows for his part a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
The Tejan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the US army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also preceded by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy foreign policy weight.
The opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that the Cold War had won.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to blow the pistone in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their ingenious dialogue with Iran, on the rushed exit of Iraq's "boys" and on their turbulence in Libya, and they label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy.
The population is more positive about Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, he has been mistrustful of military interventions that generate a deepening.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to revive its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The North Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, which communicates directly Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with a great pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part on Baltic shores, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, in the opening of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
In symbolic terms, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned together the valve wheel that controls the entry of Russian gas into the network of Western Europe.
With this new pipeline, it will each year reach 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas additional to Western Europe through a first 1224 km radius that communicates the St Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, the possibility of building a third tube by the same route is already discussed.
For Gazprom, the finalization of this huge work presents areas of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow direct supply of gas to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening it to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a gap between the Europeans of the east and the west.
In just five years, Russia has known how to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large gas consumers and increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," said François Fillon during the gas pipeline opening, demonstrating to what extent the large gas sector contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles in the faces of the Gazprom directors, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline also implies a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It is located at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, with caution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It also required extreme measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden's waters, but the project managers gave up the project because the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be established permanently in the sea in front of its shores.
"If you have it, we'll stop the gas step in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of escape, gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that an escape will occur, since they have planned joints that, according to forecasts, they will have a flight every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device operating inside the pipeline.
In the form of a pure, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three complete days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, provide accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any type of repair.
The flow of gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and at the output of 100 bars.
Five companies have united their forces to be able to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which holds 51% of the stakes.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each), joined her.
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to that company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, all gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually being transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and by 70% with bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be €7.400 million for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are certain that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom assumes the risk of spending alone.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas to arrive before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
Total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Made half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine book is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged over time.
However, Moleskine books with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian company modo modo, based in Milan, at that time decided to launch a book of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then company consultant, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book is inspired by an old production technique, the soft skin skin (top skin), which refers to a baby cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of book was highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the vanguardist artists until the twentieth century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode.
And he succeeded.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years has remained far away, in which only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open spirit and cult.
The small Italian company, which had 12 workers at its beginnings, now has about 100 and since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its bookshelves, from Fnac to the small shops in the city center, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and need to write, despite the growth of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with Moleskine's development: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists present their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard tapes, based on the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, cylinders, computer funds... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the fall of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the Employment of Persons with Disabilities begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Discouragement?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress achieved 15 years ago is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice the rate but three times the average.
"However, there's still a lot to do."
It should be noted that the disabled continue to face numerous obstacles to accessing employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished the bachelor's degree and only 10,000 of the 2.3 million students in higher education are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for disabled people, compared to 38 per cent of the average.
In other words, there are numerous issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the labour world and that "consist of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
Moreover, there are those who are not mentioned; people's minds are advancing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur Association for the City indicated that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge about low disabilities", with "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 employees are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set out in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"Now we have reached around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The evidence: the number of establishment "subjected to this contribution" as well as the amounts disbursed has decreased between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, particularly among the major groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of the companies with between 20 and 49 workers have employees with disabilities in their template, compared with 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
In order to confront the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party brings them.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the street of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the hate gesture of his front against Turkey, the Belgian elector has no more than praise for him.
"I am very happy for Eden, for its progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's front answered.
With regard to the contrast between your presentations in your team and selection, "is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year old, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
Don't forget the pleasure.
He has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been your fan," he says.
That will undoubtedly strengthen especially the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because you will face " Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " , remember.
"We just faced a few years ago.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to "glorious" on his part.
"Glorious" for arguing "a gala party."
"Grogello" also for checking, as "neighbor", that France "renews to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share the plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he pointed out.
"We are building something; players are ambitious, hungry.
"You will be able to see it in the next match." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento faces great optimism at the return party against Bosnia (22h00), to be held in Lisbon on Tuesday.
In the party of departure, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; the selection, which has run since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to win.
Given the party of departure (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that would have given him peace.
"It's a good result, but it also takes a risk, since we haven't marked out."
But at home, at the bright stage of the Lisbon Light, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of a audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is obvious that the party "is very equal", says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope that the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of participating in the Eurocopa 2012", however, has relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's kick in Bosnia forces Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a bump, although they also need to be marked.
"It's a good result, but it takes a risk at the same time, since we haven't marked out of the house," laments Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning to "do not let time to think".
A good idea, if you're realistic this time.
