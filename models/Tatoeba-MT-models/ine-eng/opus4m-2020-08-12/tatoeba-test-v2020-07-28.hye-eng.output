Tom reads for his daughters.
My computer is expensive.
There's smoke.
Tom worked at the hospital.
I remember.
Continue reading:
Keep going.
Don't worry.
Sit tight.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
Ask someone.
Look closer.
Hide.
We're the best alike.
Stop fighting.
It worked.
Don't yell.
Come on in.
Obviously, Tom is sad.
Tom ran away.
Tomorrow's gonna be hot.
Tom inspired.
Brace yourselves.
Tom doesn't want them to see how he talks to you.
Everyone came out.
Come on.
I don't think you fooled me.
I just want to say that I'm sorry.
Be careful.
He's gone.
Drive the car harder.
I don't want to go to school.
Be good.
Here you go.
You're so hot.
I'm ready to go.
Sit down here.
How long have you lived here?
Tom was dancing.
It doesn't matter.
They lied.
Tom flew.
My mother's home.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Stay calm.
Take a step back.
Of course:
How beautiful!
You think I should do that?
It's incredible!
Nobody knows.
Put your hands on.
What's your number?
It was a good shot.
Tom didn't go into detail.
Attention.
Please, stop.
Tom was tingling.
They laughed.
Keep this.
Tom took a breath.
They're gone.
I can't stand to think about it.
Come on in time.
Are you going to go on vacation this year?
Come on.
A little bit to that.
The airline is only carrying out cargo transfers.
Tom broke up.
Where are you from?
Tom told me he didn't learn French at the university.
Sit tight.
Look here.
Get out of here.
Is there anyone in the house?
I'm sorry I'm so late.
I punched Tom in the face.
I don't agree.
Keep dancing.
Don't worry about Tom.
Tom did it by hand.
I've been sleeping all day.
Find Tom.
Tom brought Mary home with his car.
Women change the world.
A little high, please.
Tell her I'm asleep.
Tom married a girl from Boston.
Everyone laughed.
He's afraid of darkness.
I'm not quite sure yet.
Fill the bucket with water.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
Take it easy.
Someone's cute.
Finish it.
It was uncertain.
Do what I've asked.
It won't change anything.
I don't understand that at all.
Keep practicing.
Look at this.
What a shock!
Tom had to ask Mary for help.
Keep looking.
Keep going.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Have fun.
Sit tight.
Be content.
I don't know why Tom didn't come, and I don't want to ask him.
I remember.
One read:
Stay focused.
Go ahead.
Be careful.
Feel this.
It helps.
Wait here.
Read it.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
I believe you'll succeed.
Come to us.
One day you'll understand.
Look at it.
How interesting!
Hang on, please.
What books does Tom read?
I have two brothers and three sisters.
There are three parts of the campsite in this area.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
Tomorrow, Tom needs to go to school.
Keep digging.
It's amazing.
Change the score.
Coffee, please.
He's really good at talking.
Don't worry, please.
I looked around you.
Take it.
You tried.
Keep fighting.
Did you hear me at all?
Eat slowly.
I'm not a doctor.
This is a bird.
We're together.
Take everything.
Come to us.
You did the experiment.
Let me.
The apple is on the table.
Tom's giving his new car a heads-up.
Contracts are already negotiated.
Don't say anything.
Look under the trees.
How come you don't know?
Brace yourselves.
What a surprise!
They yelled.
Keep working.
Tom was going through.
I wanted to read that book all the time.
Me too.
Everyone laughed.
"Burge-calife," is now considered the highest skyscraper in the world.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Forgive us.
That was amazing.
He's walking.
Go back at once.
The tree swims.
Get out of here.
Take it easy.
Try again.
I'll give you five minutes to solve this problem.
What are you standing for?
Move a little bit:
I didn't even think you liked Tom.
When do you buy?
They won.
My mother's home.
Tom died as a result of a stupid accident.
It's changed.
I gave up.
When do you buy?
Tom recovered.
How does this work?
Let's do it.
Stop trying.
Follow him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
Be patient.
Let it go.
It doesn't matter.
I sat at home for a week.
I started living alone.
Take this.
Kiss me.
Are you kidding me?
Tom wondered if it was worth discussing with Mary.
Tom doesn't give a sign.
Get ready.
Tomorrow's gonna be hot.
Tom was laughing.
Time flies.
We've forgotten.
Now I need to see Tom.
Say, "All right."
They started a few hours ago.
Eat something.
He was weak because of his blood loss.
Don't yell.
Be careful.
Try this.
Is there a man in the house?
Be reasonable.
Keep going.
Don't wait for us.
Translate the game.
Follow him.
I'm trying.
Tom needs something.
Change that.
When do you buy?
Come on.
Come on.
Sit down.
It's amazing.
Look again.
Where should I give that?
Get up.
Stay there.
I talked to Tom last night.
Keep trying.
Can you translate the bubble?
Don't read.
They were swimming.
They called.
Tom doesn't pay attention to how he gets dressed.
It does.
We were honest.
Tom and Mary walked through a mansion.
It can't be late.
We were alive.
We work together.
Stand still.
Say "stupid."
Let me calm down.
Forgive us.
Keep dancing.
Keep yourself warm.
Think again.
We've forgotten.
We didn't get anything.
From the beginning, ladies.
I'm not a teacher.
Tom didn't say much, which is a bad sign.
One day you'll understand.
In those days, there were ancient people living there.
Finish it.
Tom was in trouble.
Not at all!
It's going to be sound.
It's simple.
Say it.
Look around you.
Stop arguing.
Tom has come to help us.
My eyes went.
Take it.
Stop them.
Start again.
Keep walking.
Tom closed his eyes and fell asleep.
Write this down.
Protect yourself.
I'm sorry enough.
Everything is important.
Be careful.
Wait a minute.
Don't wait for us.
It does.
They all yelled.
Let's not talk too much about it. Let's get to work.
Tom smiled.
He cleaned the dust with a pig.
This morning, the temperature was lower than zero.
Did you think I forgot?
Be yourself.
Be safe.
They were waiting.
Tell everyone.
Who do you want to ask?
What do you propose me to do?
Here we go.
We learn from experience.
Tom showed Mary the paper.
Watch out.
They danced.
Start writing.
Hold on.
Put it down.
They walked.
Just tell me why you're here.
Look at that.
Tom woke up.
Cut the sound.
This is my choice.
Tom does better than I do in French.
Show me.
Tom's back was gone.
Take this.
Tom was fighting.
Tom agrees.
Watch out.
It'll be easy.
Abres.
Tom's gone.
Has anyone been hurt?
Don't worry.
Tom doesn't have a sign.
Sing with me.
Ask Tom.
I promise.
No one answered.
It's not bad.
Go to sleep.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Tom's never been in my house.
Come on.
That's enough lies.
You have the right to have your opinion.
It's very funny.
All right.
Keep working.
Stop it.
Of course I can, even though I don't speak the Shanghai language.
I invested.
Let's figure out how it's gonna help.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Be fair.
When did you tell me?
Be smart.
Tom's a very self-contained man.
Tom agreed.
We didn't get it.
There's an older man in the audience.
I'll watch TV.
Wait for me next to the car.
Tom tried to speak French to the seller.
Even if we're late, it won't bother us.
Ask Tom.
Ask Tom.
What's so scary?
Know I'm in love with Mary.
I don't agree.
I want to make sure it's perfect.
Think of us.
Stay away.
Listen.
Does that sound stupid?
Tell me.
What's the name?
We remember.
Running as fast as I could, I was able to catch my friend.
We're going to have fun.
Tom doesn't put the sign on the ring.
Put it in.
I waited.
Something's changed.
Tom's on the run.
We waited.
Oh, my God!
Everyone knew.
Sleep well.
This box contains 5 apples.
I'm against it.
Tom asked us to be patient.
I thought he didn't have the right to do that.
Tom laughed.
Don't pay attention to Tom.
It won't change anything.
No one made a wish.
I have to be able to do something about it.
Think about it.
Ignore them.
Many workers had missing fingers.
Keep searching.
They were going through.
Keep worrying.
Can you speak French?
Look at us.
I can't stand it anymore.
Eat something:
Tom died three months before he graduated.
Tom was a genius.
Tom and Mary ate in silence.
Welcome home.
Have a good day.
Join us.
Tom swims better than Mary.
Tekwi right.
Be real.
Start again.
Everyone smiled.
I'd like to know how this happened.
Keep it.
Let's tell you why we came.
Anyway, thank you.
Yeah.
Tom's with his mother.
Stay away.
They're gone.
He was rushing home.
Don't worry.
You can't do it without me.
Please, come on.
I'm more worthy.
Give it to me.
Keep going, please.
You were supposed to wait.
Don't go to the pool.
It helps.
Now I need to see Tom.
Forget him.
It's a good condition today.
Do you know Tom's name?
Don't cry.
Please sing.
Let's do this.
I don't know yet, did he get there or didn't he?
You're so hot.
Tom's gone.
No one came.
Why do you stand?
Oh, no.
Tom answered.
Hold on.
Tom called his neighbors.
Take a walk.
I'll see you at school.
Take him.
Tom and Mary are left alone in the room.
Kiss me.
Take this.
Get out of the way.
Keep moving.
Hurry up.
Smile.
Even green perceptions are infuriated.
Keep them.
I see.
Hurry up.
What are they waiting for?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
Go tomorrow.
Hold on.
Say, "Please."
There's a bad crowd coming out of it.
We're trying.
Tom can go to the club any minute to hear Mary sing.
Tom liked Australia.
Take measures.
The tree is green.
Don't be proud.
Read this.
Be content.
It was uncertain.
Let's get up.
Shut up.
I think I left something in the audience.
One day you'll understand.
Come what I asked.
I'm in shock.
It works.
Be careful.
Do you know Tom's surname?
Tom was crying.
Stay here.
The flowers bloom.
That's enough of a lie.
Join me in the paper.
What happened?
The house is small.
Do you love your mother?
Come on in.
Tom wants a new car.
Here you go.
Someone got mixed up.
Mary said it.
Start singing.
Answer me.
It worked.
We forgot.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take a step back.
Sit down, please.
What's the difference?
A language is never a good one.
They got it.
Listen.
Tom came back to the room.
I also think you cheated on me.
Keep working.
It's okay.
Finish this.
Tom was sick.
They're playing kids.
Think again.
When do you buy?
Let's do it.
There's no scarves on this.
Why are we running?
Put handcuffs on him.
Everyone smiled.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom fought.
The shingles are waving.
We promised.
It happened.
Sit down here.
Hold on.
Tom invited me to go with the filmmaker Mary.
Get ready.
Tell me what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it.
What?
All right, Tom.
Be sure.
It's been years.
Get dressed.
Tom forgot.
I like it here.
If the syringe is going to weaken my head, I'm going to have a few bites instead of this terrible drug.
Tom really respects you.
I said some things I didn't want to say.
Look here.
Good world!
I've never eaten horse meat.
Let's not talk long and hard.
Do you want to see what's new?
We were saved.
A warm one.
Take it easy.
They kissed.
Tom and I will go together.
Marry me.
You better go home as soon as you can.
They say Tom Jackson is one of Boston's best lawyers.
You'll do it.
End the game:
They approve.
It's just your opinion.
Fill the cassava with water.
You're the leader.
Tom begged us to be patient.
Healthy food is important to a healthy body, a healthy consciousness, and the result is to have the most effective.
Hurry up.
He believed the truth.
Tom looked.
Champagne, please.
Stand here.
I don't dwell in detail.
Don't get up.
They all prayed.
They all started to laugh.
Tom's red.
No one asked.
Hurry up.
All right, Tom.
Smile, please.
Be honest.
I'll see you at work.
Tom, tell me.
Do the writing.
Put this down.
I looked there.
Keep it.
I live in Vienna.
I'll get in the car.
Take these.
You're running.
Don't yell.
You don't do anything but eat.
Don't do it, Tom.
Take care of them.
Ignore them.
They were doing it.
He got married last year.
Tom made a link to my website from his blog.
Stand still.
Let go of everything.
This is my choice.
Tom's gone.
Let's tell you why we came.
You're running.
Well, that's another case.
Please sing.
Have you been here all night?
You'll do well to pull back.
It's time.
Tullai.
I doubt that's what happened.
Tell me what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it.
Stay away.
Keep them.
Nobody pays attention.
Stay away.
Come back.
Will you come for a minute?
Sing with me.
Tom often heard about Mary, but he hasn't met her yet.
Wait a minute.
Leave Tom alone.
Let Tom.
Stop shooting.
Creature doesn't have teeth.
He's gone.
Don't go.
Tom heard it.
Tom wanted to sleep long, but he couldn't sleep.
It's over.
Start here.
That's enough to make you laugh.
Be loving.
Be ready.
Tom was an alcoholic.
Tom got sick.
How many years have you lived here?
Does it seem anonymous?
Can you speak French?
Keep yourself warm.
I thought Mary still loved me.
Stay here.
It's really impressive.
I don't know.
Mary ran.
Try again.
I've slept a lot.
I understand.
Forget Tom.
Thank you.
Grab him.
Sit down.
Don't yell.
Start writing.
Every man's work, whether it's literature, music, painting, architecture or anything else, is always his image.
No noise.
Everything's changed.
Ask Alex.
There's always options.
You were supposed to wait.
Let's do this.
I'm out of work.
What are you trying to do?
Stay here.
It helped.
Where are you from?
Keep digging.
I missed you.
That's enough of the argument.
I got it wrong.
Take it easy.
Tom can go to the club at any time to listen to Mary's song.
It's cold.
Stop it.
We don't need Tom.
I finished my homework when you called me.
Do you have plans for tonight?
I'm not tired.
Keep going.
How amazing!
Prepare:
Tom got sick.
What's your favorite bird?
Tom is a very beautiful man.
Call us.
What about going to a movie?
Remember this.
These things aren't mine.
We've lost.
Take me.
Call me.
He was shouting.
That's interesting.
Who died?
Stand here.
It's easy to say, but it's not easy to do.
Don't worry about Tom.
Sit down.
Slow eating:
I'll try again.
Tom's gone.
We forgot.
Tom needs to thank me.
I'll be back soon.
Take care.
Hurry up, please.
Be loving.
Don't worry.
Be patient.
Everyone was alive.
Speak clearly.
He tried.
Gather yourself together.
Speak clearly.
It's a numerator.
Who knows?
Sit down here.
I love apples the most.
I'm practicing.
Do you have a more detailed map?
I got a message from Tom.
Tom looked into Mary's eyes.
Tom paid.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
The bread is fresh.
I want Tom killed.
Tom died.
Please specify the conditions for your use of this information.
Be smart.
After you.
I just ignore them.
What does Tom read?
Look at this.
Stand still.
I can do the math.
Don't talk.
Protect yourselves.
You've been patient.
Everyone's dreaming.
Thank you!
Tom went to the hospital.
Keep talking.
I forgot.
I'm sorry.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Take this.
Go a little bit to it.
Finish this.
Open the fire.
Do you have any details?
Tom is much stronger today.
Fire.
Excuse me, can I leave a message?
Take me.
Please come and let me go.
It'll be great.
I drink milk.
Come on.
It can't be late.
Keep reading.
Even if he doesn't come, we have to start.
Don't get up.
Tom was asleep.
Tom can't accept your gift.
First Tom hated Boston.
It's offensive.
Everything's changed.
Tom heard how they named him.
Stay away.
Tom's dead.
You're welcome to resist.
Tom looked at his watch.
Speak loud.
Ask different people.
The wood is burning.
Let her go.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
Be respectful.
Stop arguing.
I can't let you do this.
Please don't mention my name.
Gather yourselves together.
It's worth looking at that girl.
Are you gonna do something right now?
Seventy-eight years is the normal life span of a person.
Forgive me.
Call me.
Hurry up at home.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Don't move.
Is there a man in the house?
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Use caution.
Speak loud.
Well, I'll see you.
Tell Tom.
Did I leave something out?
Tom knows.
Snow came.
You can't do it without me.
It's enough to get upset.
Tell everyone.
Speak clearly.
Answer me.
When did you tell me?
Is it normal for me to sit here?
Keep writing.
Tom thought he was adorable.
I'm sorry.
Be careful.
Keep trying.
Come back soon.
Excuse me.
The decision was made.
My sword is a sword.
I left Tom alone.
I got it.
That's right.
I drink tea too.
Tom stood there waiting for the road to pass.
I just want to have an excuse to apologize.
Be safe.
I don't remember what I ate last night.
Eat it.
Ask Tom about it.
You think I should do that?
Tom ran away.
Cease the fire.
They were subjected to it.
Tom's proud of his new car.
Change your shoes.
Time flew.
Tom wanted to go to Mary's at night, and he had other things to do.
Take these.
Keep smiling.
I can always sleep wherever I am.
How deep?
Start now.
Tom laughed.
Tom laughed.
I woke up.
Let him go.
Let's get closer.
Let it go.
I'm sorry enough.
Do I have a cup?
Don't pull the trigger.
Tom came out.
Tom won.
Tom's gone.
It's going to be positive.
We hope to arrive in time.
Tom advised Mary to leave as soon as possible.
Stay focused.
Tom will kill again.
Keep fighting.
Say it.
Remember that.
Listen to me.
Helped.
You're a linguist.
Don't come in.
Take it.
Tom worked at the hospital.
Tom wrote a very detailed report.
These details will not be published.
They were all proud.
Welcome to Wikipedia
Does anyone know if the dining room is open or not?
The woman's in the room.
Grab him.
Tom's trying hard to translate smoking.
Keep running.
She wants to drink a little hot milk.
Wait, please.
Help me.
Are you doing something right now?
What?
I love to grieve, I know that most people try to avoid any kind of sad feeling, but I think it's wrong.
Circle:
I have to translate the suggestions.
How disastrous!
Everyone was waiting.
What a strange thing!
Don't worry.
Sit down.
A disputer about details.
It worked.
Be creative.
Be careful.
Stay still.
What a match!
I confessed.
You have to sign this.
Be careful.
First row.
I don't care what you do with it.
A little bit of thought about it.
Why didn't you write me?
Listen.
They've all gone.
Get out of here.
Tom has a very creative spirit.
Stop.
Do you have any items on this plan?
Ask different people.
Tom failed.
Hi, Tom.
I'm sorry.
Be a snake.
I didn't even think you liked Tom.
I love you.
Be yourself.
I need that watch.
I'm sorry.
You better get back.
They yelled.
Let's draw together for my mother.
Hurry up, please.
I have two cats.
Don't say anything.
Please, stop.
What a tragedy.
We'll spend a good time in Boston.
I lost.
He was running.
We understand.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Be careful.
Don't yell.
Laugh at me.
No one died.
Tom helped.
Take this.
Grab him.
Italo Calvino returned to Italy when he was a child.
What do you propose me to do?
Get Tom in touch.
Let's go.
Don't yell.
What's someone finally gonna help or not?
You speak French?
Let him go.
Write it down here.
Have you ever been to America?
Wait a minute.
Tom flew up.
Be careful.
Don't go after the darkness.
Tom did it on his own.
Why did you stop me?
It's an old name.
I know.
Don't yell.
I don't know anything about this.
I'm late.
Thank you.
He's speeding up.
Follow me.
Good evening.
What's wrong with me?
Hold on.
Oh, my God.
Put this up.
Tom said he'd be a few minutes late.
None of my friends drink coffee.
Stay close.
Don't worry.
I don't have any more time to talk to you.
I can't translate what happened.
Ett r:
Tom cried.
Stop talking.
Tom evicted.
Don't worry.
You're not going back.
Let's go.
Chris is very attractive and rich, but not very modest.
Good dreams.
Be careful.
What a match!
Don't say anything.
Oh, my God!
It worked.
Tom drinks.
My mother was proud.
How old is your dog?
Tom survived.
I love the Avivan language.
Tom was searching.
Stop arguing.
Move a little bit.
Do you have a dictionary?
Wash.
They yelled.
Get up.
Google Translate cannot translate expressions or define individual words.
Keep going.
Help me.
What's your favorite bird?
We wrote volunteers.
Take Tommy.
Do it.
They're fucked.
Take him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
It really shocked him, and he didn't want to talk about anything for a while, and I think it would take him long enough to get back into a very violent state.
Stay calm.
I don't speak Japanese.
Tom doesn't know how to say anything in English.
Be respectful.
Tom says there's no problem.
Mr. Yoshida takes a very good head from the story of France.
Good year!
Follow Tom.
Stop complaining.
Take it.
Good.
Can you translate a wave?
Work hard.
We know all the details.
Keep writing.
Don't worry.
Come on.
I do my lessons.
Stop laughing.
I don't imagine life like that.
Get up there.
Thank you all for coming.
Tom was listening.
Write me.
Did you hear me?
He was working.
We're going to have fun.
Follow me.
I don't know the details.
Take Tommy.
Tom smiled.
That's it.
Don't fire.
Keep moving.
Tom called.
They were burned.
Let us go.
Get up.
Nobody's listening.
Tom drives a car.
They got it.
Take this.
Thank you.
What?
Be safe.
It doesn't matter how much it's worth, I'll buy it anyway.
Everything changes.
Watch out.
Take this.
We know.
I couldn't understand his thoughts.
It's too bad to count.
They're cheating.
It's not easy.
Home phone.
They were resting.
Where did you send your clothes?
Shut up.
Have fun.
Tom baked a cake for Mary.
We slept.
It's just us.
Let me introduce you.
It's my greatest happiness to read.
There's a bad crowd coming out of this.
Excuse me?
Tom is not idle.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom wasn't happy to see her.
I also drink tea.
Try again.
I agree.
Keep going, please.
Please, listen.
I gave a raise.
Come on.
This works.
How many of you are there yet?
Look closer.
Tom needs to know what's behind the ban.
He seems happy here.
The person sitting there is a famous singer.
Call us.
I can't make the proposal at all.
I find it very easy to talk to Tom.
Someone called.
Everything's broken.
It's a horse.
I've known Jim since I was a kid.
You have to sign this.
I thought he was coming.
Tom cheated.
He's here.
He's coming.
Where are we going to do that?
Watch out.
Tom said he'd help me.
Stop complaining.
I confirmed it.
Tie left.
Come on.
Don't get up.
Really?
Why are they so evil to us?
Stop shooting.
Keep walking.
