The Prague Stock Exchange is crashing into the minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of Tuesday's trades, the Prague Stock Exchange turned on the break-in on Monday when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time there was the reason for the break-in on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, the market's reaction to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there, is also reflected.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday the shares in the Asian stock exchanges, although the indices could offset some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later it was able to compete for some of the losses, so the decrease decreased to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprise index, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, dropped by 3.8 percent, and the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares in the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong is determined, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, independent of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for financial support.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the invasion.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 billion Kč) should be applied.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush's view was that the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the entire economy.
The U.S. shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the biggest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, with a similar break in 1987.
The index was already reduced before the vote, but there was hardly any sign that the draft in the House of Representatives would not pass through, the index experienced a free case.
Congress admits: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
This will be agreed on the beginning of next week.
In discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system, US legislators reached a breakthrough of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion dollars).
However, this does not mean victory.
Congressional Members must negotiate a few more details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system is being negotiated at the American Congress on Monday.
This was said on Sunday by the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank of the Reuters Agency.
In the Senate, according to different figures, it is likely that the plan could be agreed on Wednesday morning.
According to economists, the plan should be adopted, the first important psychological factor for the survival of financial markets.
After that, however, it comes to a "enormity" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice as well.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on how a package to stabilize the market should look," said Nancy Pelosi, against agency Bloomberg.
According to your words, it could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the sale of non-sale mortgage assets by financial corporations that are facing serious losses to financial corporations and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the brink of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we are on the target," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also falling significantly in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators have endeavoured to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the Congress.
This is why we want to reassure investors in front of businesses in the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where a convention decision could affect business on Monday.
However, until now it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress are voting on the law, there is also uncertainty as to whether the negotiations in the last minute could not yet fail to meet a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount allocated to the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars should be made available as soon as possible as President George Bush demanded.
However, the Congress can block the release of the rest of the money if it feels that the program does not perform its function, at another $100 billion and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush values progress in negotiations positive
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote in favour of its veto.
Despite these changes, however, there remains the basic idea of the programme, which is based on the fact that funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that have been valued are to be obtained, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've made everything up.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the bill, then on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His speaker, Tony Fratto, stated that Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and "appreciated the two-way effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limit golden fall screens
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the leading contractor, let the legislators agree on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also restrict the so-called golden fall screens for directors of companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to supervise the fund.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also provides help for homeowners who have problems with repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and enabling them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why, because you don't know, what mechanism and what price the problem assets are bought at.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share losses," Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek's view is not decisive.
"It is much more important that Congressional Members agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the coming adoption is at this point the most important," Marek said.
Duel on Messers Cut: MP3 player against phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile MP3 file can play, no MP3 player can call yet.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
Despite all this, there are enough reasons why you should join a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims to future owners.
I'm sure it's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is also no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the Regal, you probably dream of at least one of them.
So it is also expressed with music on travel, so to speak with compressed music, simply - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to issue eight thousand kroner for a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will probably consume heavy headphones for twenty kroner from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for each.
The selection is fully specialized.
The life span of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can do doesn't even make sense.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the Simsen, it can play music and videos, both recording, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also navigate.
And if you include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small wonder, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV.
But the universality of phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy frescoes.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this regard, Music Player (especially the easiest) is much more powerful.
Therefore, you should calculate with the cheap phones that they will not be able to play more than a few hours of music.
If you call again and again, you'd rather buy another charging device for the office for safety - that's also true for more expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with once charging.
Another problem is if you want to play the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connection, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card reading devices will be finished without reduction with the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
In the case of players you do not need special software up to exceptions (ipod).
You only need to feed the device from your PC via USB port with music.
Most phones and players themselves add a music library, sorted by the name of the performer, the album title, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices represent only the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Player is easier to use, phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should look especially after the lifetime of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also the comfort of the control.
If for you music is mainly music and you only listen to it every day for example in the street, then any phone that plays MP3 files will suffice.
Which can really be almost any cell phone.
You also do not need to check which music formats can process a cell phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format, using Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument for why a musical handy should be added.
Unfortunately, the provider's offer is poor and usually only limited to fast radio heat.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, this kind of sale of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) is expected to dominate the music industry in the future.
The phone's mostly on them.
If you want to listen to anything, grab the phone in the pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it comes to whether you are always wearing headphones or at least a wireless speaker.
If not, you can go back to the integrated speaker, which has almost every phone, but only the smallest MP3 player.
The probably greatest advantage of the musical handicrafts will be for many in the price.
The cheapest costs normally less than three thousand kroner.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest disability will be for most that there are no normal headphones.
The best and technically matured phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to 15,000 kroner.
The advantage of the player is in the easy operation again.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of features, the similarity with the previous normal tape recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of an incorrectly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous account for data transfers.
Which device should be handled now
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
Oh, my God.
In the base models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the cheapest can read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy another valuable MP3 player, you can access Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to put more than 1100 kroner on the table.
If you are among the most demanding listeners, please take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control keys for MP3 and the comfort of the control comes to one individual MP3 player.
Mostly here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to 4 thousand kroner, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturer.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Czechia this year.
Maybe
The mobile radio market in the Czech Republic is fairly mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic to lower prices.
Perhaps this will not be waited any longer.
The fact that Czech mobile providers work at all in Europe, we have often reported on Mobile.cz.
However, this also confirmed the ČTU telecommunications authority, which pointed out that the price for an SMS here is higher than the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some Czech mobile customers, SMS will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight.
Perhaps it sounds paradox, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of over 100 %.
On the other hand, mobile providers are happy to agree that there is very much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTU) Pavel Dvořák, who had in the past often said that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network will no longer have many chances (by the way, he would probably not find any more frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers into the mobile radio market that led to a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile providers also had to respond to.
Before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile there were similar voices on the UK market as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you do not need to look for examples for a long time.
In February this we reported on the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the country's fifth largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the Penta Financial Group, which has U:phone in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually profiled as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service supply.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers at least half cheaper SMS than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good chess game to put on a non-climbing target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Choose real guys Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept could be found in the Czech Republic as well as in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepícý also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In Czech Republic, no chance, mobile providers mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem hopeful.
It will rather come to a market entry from Mobilking in other countries of our region," says Jana Studničková, press spokesman for the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile providers in the Czech Republic are not pleased with this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to ensure that there is no potential competitor.
Your interest in starting a virtual mobile phone provider has been showing the GTS Novera group for a long time that wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of company customers.
"We have a great interest in providing not only fixed-net, but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them, we were already able to make progress in the negotiations," said the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this point, we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a fully-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
To date, we have not been addressed by a complex and serious project in this area," he said in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specific nature of the Czech market.
The press spokesman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement of O2: "So far we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will hardly show up a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this point, we should have already presented a concrete offer to think so in the short term."
Vodafone focuses more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepíký means: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we considered from the customer's point of view as the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to look for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The behaviour of mobile providers is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
The fact that suppliers can pull on a string when it comes to something is also evidence of the long track and here about the origin of U:phone.
Perhaps the strongest pressure towards ČTU came from the company T-Mobile when U:phon came to the market.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTU website.
But right now U:phone is suitable as an argument why a virtual provider should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile radio market has recently also been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider.
In view of the nature of the mobile radio market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new operator would make high demands on the market itself and in particular its services."
In view of this approach by mobile providers, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to engage in economic competition.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, referred to this whole problem of his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider over the admission of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," Kristian Chalupa, in his response to our request from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
Such a formulation would not surprise the representatives of the supplier.
This is more than worrying from an authority that represents consumer interests and should, among other things, ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual providers work quite normally, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price decline does not fall within the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is truly shocking that the almost already touching consistency of the three mobile providers resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this really is just an accident is on hand.
Just as the absolute same gas price at the fuel stations is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered in this case any signs that would imply action directed against competition, and thus it has no reason to intervene in any way on the matter.
None of the suppliers have a dominant market position, so they also do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their operations on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile radio market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulatory authority," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTU, according to telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always required for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile provider - logically - has the monopoly for his network.
This means that in a particular segment he is necessarily taking a dominant position.
However, even if one does not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile providers are acting in a similar manner.
A number of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) argue that they are faced with very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The discharge of responsibility to the ČTU is then a rather common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distanced itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the Novelle of the Telecommunications Act recently adopted failed to implement the extension of ČTU's competence in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, even though a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this very well, but they probably have different interests.
It's okay if no one looks.
Only once remains the operation of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
There are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partially public.
This is usually the case for companies operating in the area of multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only selected.
The joke is that the company acts as a classic company customer, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile providers prohibit a similar type of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it can be an infringement of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal, which can lead to an end of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not happen to mobile providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be involved.
However, no operator opposes such an action.
These companies do not allow them to make unnecessary profits, while, unlike the actual virtual suppliers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepíký points out possible problems: "The law enables such kinds of speculation, although the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not run on their phone, so they cannot fully have it as normal customers of mobile providers."
But this alone had to be at least unusual for the ČTU.
There is also a further question for the ÚOHS.
Do mobile providers close their eyes before such a move, why do they block themselves from a virtual provider?
It is to be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to satisfy itself with the provider's statement, they did not know anything about it and their business conditions would prohibit this.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been pointed out in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought a significant price decline in the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers were created, classic providers have tried to prevent their origins from practically more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too small, or too saturated market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it is precisely in these moments that regulatory bodies intervene, not in any way the interests of mobile providers, but those who tried to prove to their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and that they followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves into the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot escape the impression that uncertainty in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider will soon appear, the Czech mobile phone market may be moving again soon.
If a provider permits the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive if it is to refuse (to discriminate) other stakeholders.
And then the Czechs will finally stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find out the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented on the occasion of the day of the Czech state in an hour of celebration the new recordings of the National anthem Where is my home country.
The hymn was re-enacted by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo songs, in chorus and in an instrumental version.
The song was taken over by Kateřina Kněžinková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiaháš and Jaroslav Krkek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions at once.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech broadcaster that he had selected young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are marked and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried to keep a clear dictionary with both and also with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that there can be agreement," said the conductor.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov moj sounded for the first time in 1834 at the stage of the stage theater in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škrup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
Who sounds the "new" hymne
The Prague transport companies transport on Wednesday also for the first time on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will be included in the history of Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in the bag will enter a subway, road or bus instead of a paper card.
These can currently buy around one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Guests can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and play it on their chip card at the same time, in the info centres and branches of the transport companies at the underground stations Museum, Mostek, Nádraží Holesovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letnáany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available on the Internet since yesterday on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used up to the afternoon hours by over four hundred customers.
Those who use the Internet can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait in long hoses for their paper cars so far.
They buy the coupon on the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places, travellers also have a trained staff switch available, who advises on the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," said project spokesperson Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on the Opencard self-service machines installed in some subway vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remember the driver's license, the passengers may have noticed them already at the train stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls an auto instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon is playing by itself.
The electronic coupons apply not only in the capital but also in the environment from tomorrow.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region reached the capital.
"In the trains that belong to Prague's integrated transport, the train attendants have reading devices with which they can check the validity of the coupons after time and zone," explains Filip Drápal from the organisation Ropid.
The suburban buses have card reading devices at the driver's seat.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown by the driver, but the Opencard must be placed at a designated place on the side of the box.
Thus the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the played coupons, it is not easier than the driver to ask for this information," said Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive with suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon expires can go back to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here are the information about the validity of its documents on the display of the device.
The South demanded a nationwide decision from the United States
In 1945, the Sudet Germans had asked for membership of the Böhmer forest in the United States.
This comes from a letter that stores in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945, some groups of Sudet Germans had turned to the US presidents.
Among other things, this comes from a letter that has been received in a private archive and is kept today in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask in the letter to the American President, he is not going to allow the return of the "sudden Gauss" - adopted on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and really want to be sure that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "People whose destiny of the South lies at the heart."
As the connection to Czechoslovakia with the Sudet Germans - in recognition of the Czech national character - suggests that they would expect brutality, carelessness, incomprehensibility, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American presidents to take over the Bohemian forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million people in this area, you are addressing a foreign state that has oppressed and tried to eliminate minorities and has not contributed anything at all to the victory of the Allies," says the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is apparently the fear of rachels of the "Czech Underpresser".
If the U.S. president had doubts about the meaning of the Böhmerwalddeutsche, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or would live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of post-war history may sound somewhat naive, in the opinion of some Timepieces, it paints a good picture of the then expectations of the Sudet Germans.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to at least deny that they would negotiate their withdrawal from the Republic, only a few of them had such an opportunity at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the South.
Others believed they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Buddhist Germaner at the Marine at the Baltic Sea.
When he arrived in British prison at the end of the war and was taken to Holstein in a war prison camp, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him, he was going to bring them Czech.
"They believed if they came home, the Czech would pass them," says Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia thought he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decree.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive action for security on the streets in Czech history.
Similarly, the emotional-charged media campaign, which wants to start the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday, could be characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš Räbíček promises to take drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million kroner will run on television, on radio, on cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to reduce the driver from too fast driving and alcohol to tax.
And they also remember that they were on their way.
The campaign wants to talk to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign also testifies to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "not thinking" are in capital letters on a sign sign.
And in a glass of blood, the word "pays".
This should mean that you can pay for a moment of carelessness with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see perfectly normal images with drastic images of victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and the number of accidents on the Czech streets.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar beet and peaches for drivers
"For the drivers the motto applies sugar bread and peitsche.
Sugar bread means that, for example, if they drive at red, they save time.
Then the punishment or an accident is the threat.
The driver has to be reminded of the risk," says traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
Therefore, information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Even less effective are his opinion on tables that draw drivers' attention to a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably be flooded soon with the environment, and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in the exchange for peace
The President of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if one could conclude peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for it.
He stressed this in an interview published on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert said against the paper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli territories) because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include Oster Jerusalem as well.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has happened, will have to give up some of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in an illustration of two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and holy and historic places" located in the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he continued.
Deduction of the Golan heights
Olmert spoke of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he considered to be an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone and on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Highs," said Olmert.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to give up in order to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shitish) Hisbollah movement; they will have to give up their continued support to the terrorism of the (Shitish) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewarts on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know her, in a remote bus the rerun is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether Stewarts and travellers can go back and forth on the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to comply strictly and formally with the law, then the activity of a steward is in violation of the law on road transport," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a two-and-twenty-year-old Stewardess died last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the road by bus.
At this point, the young woman sat at the side of the driver, at the least safest place in the car, even though she had two more seats.
But a bus can also have an accident at the moment or brake sharply, in which the Stewart coffee or newspapers bear.
It also plays a role if the bus is also equipped with parking spaces.
If this is not planned on the bus, the passengers must sit.
The student agency's bus has no parking space; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this has not agreed to the movement of travellers first.
Later, you took this back, and we reached a consensus where travellers can go to the toilet during the trip, if they have their seat," he told his position.
The law doesn't know a Stewart
"There is no clear legal explanation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the term 'vehicle companion'; however, its rights and obligations do not define it', says Hanzelka's spokesperson.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorny, believes that the law subsequently covers this issue.
"It comes to the question whether the bus in the product authorisation also has seats.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided into urban buses where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, coaches with parking spaces and a higher allowable speed and coaches without parking spaces with the highest speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The BESIP Transport Safety Officer Jaroslav Horín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewarts on board a bus.
"In a liquid journey, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
It's not safe here either when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can hit his head."
"But if a bus breaks sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or a street train.
The security of the Stewarts must be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and also believes that this problem is not completely resolved from the perspective of the law.
Jancura is ready to cancel services
Student Agency offers as its only bus company the services of Stewarts.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his profession as risky even after the accident.
"As soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travellers at the entrance.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin founded the lack of Stewarts in his bus. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to a student agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we've been fighting from the beginning.
Earlier or later, it ends with some fatal accident," he had not spoken for Týden.cz a year ago.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region was disappointed who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off without glancing from the stop strip and had blocked the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid a sharp manoeuvre, however, coincided with the right front with the truck.
That the two seats were sold for the stewards, Jancura argues.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to report truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment, but a financial compensation is also expected from the debtor.
An amendment to the law?
Not Visible
A more detailed regime for the movement of Stewarts on board a bus could bring about a legal regime in which a thirty-head expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet come to any concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says Fachmann Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the Stewarts to be something that could pose a significant risk to the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, who controls the safety of buses in police and labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the letter from the WestLB Executive Board does not include the staff of the house.
By bringing together units of the Düsseldorf Money Institute with the Frankfurter Deca Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finance Group" could be created, says the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB had a "competence block" with sustainable yield in such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive link between the commitment to further mergers in the country's banking sector.
This is the case when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the hit WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Agency, which the North Rhine-Westphalia Government has recently made clear that it is time to find a future solution.
From a connection between the Deca bank, which knows savings customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chief Franz Waas was informed of the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a country bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the board of directors of the Deca, which is carried out in half of the country banks and savings banks, has instructed the board to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks are free, so it is called in the financial space, just started.
From the Deca bank, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt, it is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked as if the Deca Bank could merge with the Bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
However, nothing came from this triad.
The plans had barely become public, the Hessian government spoke out against the participation of Helaba.
So the other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been thought games about a connection between the Deca Bank and Landesbanks.
However, Günther Merl, President of the Helaba Board, had recently spoken against planning games about a relationship with his house.
Regardless of this, however, there seems to be a need for a collapse of the various houses of the public-law sector.
After the elections in Bayern have been held, the BayernLB could be the first to connect with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, you go to and from the partners.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far experienced a much better financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Hessen-Thüringen Sparkassen and Giroverband, which is 85 percent involved in the Helaba, has precipitated a row at the beginning of the year.
Stay the North LB anyway.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl raised the crucial question of the business model to ensure the future viability of the national banks, which had not been answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
At the end of the day, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB which is not desirable there, however, of course.
This is also the case in the letter of the Board of Directors of the House, and it will certainly be a "total solution" for the house.
As this allows the integration of individual units with the Deca bank to be brought under a hat, it will still be shown.
The second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is his girlfriend with her, and so be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre bierfass of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bartender and proves the approximately 200 October-fest travelers, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to the station Puorta Nuova, will start at 23.45 a.m. four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della brewra", arrival expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved especially for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they already celebrated at night.
And so said Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur and a glasses with wide silver brackets, belongs to the buses.
For five years they've been driving to October party, three tours are alone this year.
At night, day after day, at 10:30 p.m., back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euros costs the ride, the welcome drink with Emperor-Bier, married faithfully to the Bavarian supply of purity, health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll in the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers will sleep.
Well, they're gonna need their strength.
It will be held in Brixen and wooden churches, where there are also several other buses with Italian signs on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marcos Group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese in the early half hour, they are already there on the other 50 buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a last claim, explains the attack plan.
First: Set up the yellow cap.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, in addition to the Internet address of Marcos Travel Office: "conoccersiviagando.it".
Second: "If the doors go up to the beer tent, it's called running!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all of the yellow coins on the same banks, distribute in the room!"
The measure, that's Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the drinking money.
"The security people show that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave your homes, they will be gone."
Third, "This evening the point is eleven again!" Understand?
And it's about to know.
On the way, a yellow cap connects as road marks to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral plaque of a large Bavarian folk party.
You want to be armed for the retreat.
It is known as "Italian Weekend".
There are no precise figures on numbers; the speech is of 50,000 who are on the way over the Alps and fall into the beer cellars, ten percent of all visitors are to be visited this weekend extra from Italy.
The Munich Police is reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a nation statistics in which Italians are first placed in front of Britain (about 60 jobs) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
Especially popular among Italians is the court brewery.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also emphatically that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis-like developments.
Because it's coming in at the end of the week.
The Münchner Real Estate Financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted in Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to shield themselves from the turbulence on the markets.
One person familiar with the situation said on Monday, the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate had only to paint the part it would also use.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
There are losses to the daughter of Depfa.
According to a press report on long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state financier had refinanced itself extremely in the short term - which is no longer possible because of the suspicion of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s Barresserve was reduced by 95 per cent to Euro 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had been slightly reduced from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year, the proceeds from calls for claims and certain securities and the resolution of repayments in the credit business decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher returns on post-storey cost of the restructuring of the former Depfa group, and on the reimbursement of interest after the payment order and from the business provision for group companies, the profit reduction was still moderate with around 16 per cent.
The former state financier had first speculated on commercial real estate loans after its privatisation in 1990, which were then disbursed in the Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of merit in classical state funding, the Depfa had then increased in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the State (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make depreciations that will have a "essential material effect" on the winning and losing of the group, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is, the dividend was deleted.
By 2007 it had been reduced by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a significant state and infrastructure financier since the divestment.
It is more dependent on the refinancing of the interbank market than other institutions, since it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among the banks is largely overrun, as the banks have their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs a share - around 50 billion euros - of the depfa credit portfolio for short-term refinancing.
Following the announcement of the Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered by the loan at a noticeable time and the company is shielded from the influence of the current highly inefficient international money markets.
From other sources, it is possible to hear that the money has been secured by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke stated, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets at a reasonable time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Agency (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secure.
This is to hope for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inevitable that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After the settlement of the bank before insolvency on the late Sunday evening, at least the premature rescue will not be able to calm the spouses.
The share rate falls by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the loan rates are good.
If the priority debts are hardly moved, the rates of the second-hand loans are more clearly stated.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, of course, the maturity over 2009.
This seems to be a speculative investment alternative to hypo-real state loans, so their value must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following a clear increase in the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over from the depfa.
As long as notary banks, governments and less-sponsored commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a timely reduction of pensions may be made.
Or it is something that is not yet expected of anyone - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that overlap with the sub-nationalisation, only a legitimate hope has now been created from the possibility of security-restricted.
This should, in particular, provide long-term believers with some sleepless nights with the decision to separate themselves from their commitment.
Short-term investors can still use a margin of loss for future payroll tax payments to form a profit at a later date.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, to introduce herself at the Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to pee: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells from Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone. Luckily, I didn't walk.
The beginning of the teaching does not seem as strict as we were at home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from eight o'clock until about twenty-nine a short round of discussion begins with the teacher who 'home room'.
But before the class started, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk to people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I had not yet had a form of school, I pulled an old dress from my guest mother, including blue blouses, blue ankles and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the pulpit and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At the time, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all whispered, looked and yelled, and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I already knew that from my mangas.
It is part of the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'nothing, sweet'.
Then I'll be housed in my seat soon.
The girl next to me was pretty much limited, she found it an honor for the exchange student to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong turned, I was regularly beaten.
Everyone talked to each other and keeled and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all their bentos were picked up.
My guest mother had also made me a lunch box - it's something different than the fates of German holiday bread.
I had rice with herbs, small herbs, lettuce from barley and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Mostly I don't have any bluffs, which I eat right here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
I'm sure everything's really nice.
Well, up to the salty flowers, maybe, bro!
The Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which then builds her especially artificially - in the hope of getting to know the boy at the pause.
I read about it in my Manga comics.
I'm nervous if I can see this here too.
'Why did Japan calculate?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me now."
Finally, I've been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And in order to understand the comics and culture better, I started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to go here sometime.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, seats and customs.
And you put great value on it.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees in danger, does that mean that it also feels afraid?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how can you check if they feel the same when they behave the way we do?
In the Internet magazine Edge, the contributions of famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other conditions of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this until now where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut to pieces questions of feeling or general consciousness, we enter impenetrable land because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, and some scientists have concluded a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one thing, the switch circuit associated with human consciousness almost always includes the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in the short-term memory and the execution/control functions).
This vast region is much higher in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge that we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may have been acquired, is probably very different from most of our consciousness conditions.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, neither measure nor, because of the special hardware, can be analysed on the basis of our own experience, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically easier to access.
It is possible to examine the processes of the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one moves rather towards the neural correlations of consciousness than towards the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the status of visualization.
What happens now to the feelings?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a conscious brain in its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like physical reactions) is recorded.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which distinguish the primates and, in particular, the people.
Linked to linguistic nature are fine degrees of feeling, because we can differentiate and categorize conditions with the help of words and grammar to attribute them to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings from more primitive activities in the regions of the cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which however focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can be involved in completely cross-generational feelings.
In theory, I can't contradict it, but I think it's unproveable.
Pankzeep argues what appears to rats and people like fear, probably also feels like: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees in danger if it also feels afraid?
In my view, only behavioural similarity can not yet prove the same.
Although the neural comparison continues: rats and humans have similar brains, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to people: how did you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamental to our differences (because the human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is slowed here, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I have feelings, I do not know if they exist.
You can keep this brief, but I prefer to walk on a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are looking back.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian Association President Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
The Polish Association of PZPN has been suspended following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and has been replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki, Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer from this."
Several first-class men were sentenced only in the last season for manipulation to a forced rise, and finally even the league start had to be postponed in a short time.
Employer Dennis Quaid kicks back
She wanted to promote a new film, said in the interview about Privates - and now she has problems with the Ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan evicted her lazy Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
He sneezes - and beats back.
Later rose war at the former husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an uncool dispute with each other - in all the public.
Meg Ryan had spoken in an interview with the U.S. InStyle magazine for the first time last week about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud has only been demonstrated after divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a marriage break is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband fell out clearly: "Unbelievably," said 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "I repeatedly buys and wraps up the history of our relationship".
It is also "suffering," that the joint 16-year-old son, Jack, is again "publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals that mean a separation for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become father to twins.
And so he concluded with the statement: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that works best."
Discount prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper as a result of a current study of up to 50 percent.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the American Express Travel and Financial Service provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant breach in the second quarter.
After prices have risen on the hotel market for many years, overnight stays have already been agreed on in many places.
From January to March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 percent in 41 of the 48 cities surveyed in Europe compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
Most clearly the trend in Paris and Rome was where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
For this reason, American Express sees the weak dollar course that led to a "decreasing travel list of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
Also at the flight prices, the trend showed still upwards in the first quarter:
Because of the kerosene pollution, passengers in the economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than 2007, fuel-intensive long-range flights even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for air tickets from the economy class decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class price changes were significantly lower.
In Germany prices are even higher than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
On German domestic flights, prices have even been half-priced, according to the study.
On the one hand, the company explains the reason for the price collapse is the declining economic growth.
The demand in many segments of the airline market is broken.
On the other hand, the Open Ski Agreement, which liberalises air transport between the US and Europe, provides an increased competitive pressure.
The signs of the tense situation were the elimination of non-profit routes at airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had registered in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats gladbach 1:1
With a door and simple methods, the Hamburger SV will become a table guide.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning Elf.
From Kristoffer Klein enlarge the break landing for national players Marko Marin.
The gladiator first came into play late and failed with a lift to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went convincingly over his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger said in the cabin passage of the Hamburger Arena.
Not much was left in the catacombs, the half-time period was over and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger was a Physiotherapist of the HSV for nearly three decades, he enjoys a higher view than some dilated actor.
And so his request was also heard in responsible places.
Coach Cornelius Jol nibbled and lifted the thumbs with consent.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Chief Coach Martin Jol.
Its command is similar to: Here with door two!
Implementation continued.
"There wasn't everything to look at today," Marcel Jansen later said.
Just as Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted to relax.
The 1:0 (1:0) are due to the Hamburgers to Mladen Petric's headball match (11); and the fact that very weak gladiators could not mourn the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol joined.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the viewers already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the flashboards on the video wall, which proved their association to be class primal.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to sort this out," said Marcel Jansen.
He considers that the table intermediate is more for the incalculation of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Torschütz Petric and the Jansen from the FC Bayern - is slow to shine, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," asked Jol.
After the vote
On Wall Street, the fear is gone.
First news of the failure of the rescue package broke Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss within a day in his history.
Later, the Dow started again.

Bank Goldman Sachs' shares remained almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Großinvestor Warren Buffet participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be provided for the purchase of so-called foul mortgage papers.
However, the sum should be paid not to a blow but to a step-by-step.
On the other hand, the State should receive stock options certificates from financial corporations which could be redeemed in the course of appropriate price developments in order to reduce the burden on the State funds.
Share rates in Europe and the USA in downwards.
The billion aid to banks in Europe and the United States does not resolve the investors' doubts.

The stock markets went into the knees all over the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the $700 billion heavy rescue package of the US government could not be enough to reinvigorate the financial markets.
The Dow lost in the first trading hour 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10.809,25 points.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, which could follow the vote in the Senate on 1 October.

Dark matter affects flight from space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon in research has been providing advice: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-manover.
Experts feared that the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein, could not be quite correct.
Nearly 18 years old, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through the space.
Because of soon cooling fuel lines, you are now threatening your cold death.
Among scientists, for years there has been a mysterious phenomenon of confusion - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a space probe flight over which it receives additional vibration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sunshine Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been amazed at for years: the flight bodies do not behave 100 percent as expected under the old-fashioned gravitational law.
Instead, there are irregularities at the speed.
The probes get faster or slower.
Until now, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general relativity theory Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a bending of space, could not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have invented in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
From the existence of dark matter, space researchers have only known for about ten years.
Obviously, it is a force of attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies is observable.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the dark matter makes up one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists carried out in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists dragged into Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The fugitives from Sudan had demanded several million euros of money.
Six hostages should have been killed in a firefight before the release.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were taken away.
Solubility negotiations should already be under way.
Again and again, the Germans are turning into the viewers of Kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists who were dragged into the Sahara are apparently free.
This reported the Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports by the Italian TV broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking her health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were well and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: the kidnappers were ready, according to an Egyptian security officer, to finish the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers surprisingly.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the official said.
It was "just gone to take the hostages," as suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and two of them were arrested.
The hostages had demanded six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German mediator, delaying the release of hostages because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
Men should be detained for as long as the kidnappers have a safe flight route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
The abuse of the stepfather " led to suicide"
The long abuse by her stepfather has led to the death of a woman, a court was reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after he had been sexually abused in eight cases.
The Court of Justice in Truro found that he regularly had his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle arrested when she was between five and seven years old.
Treise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Mrs. Randle was transferred to her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Treise had tied her eyes together before committing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a guesthouse.
Treise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the Court found that Mrs. Randle, who worked for a large part of her time in honor of the National Trust, had been prosecuted for abuse which had been added to her twice a week.
State Attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and biker, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "surrendered her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she died by drowning herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confessional letter, who ended up saying, "I cared to tie her up and tie her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been scary for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would be nothing before the court if she had not done so."
He added: "I am aware of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The data lost officer shall be charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be charged with "Public Security Act".
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
There is the weakest charge within the law and there is no reference to criminal intent.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that this would have been the case within the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned shall be charged, in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, with the clause relating to the safe storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor's Office recommended that the officer should be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he submitted included classified assessments on Al-Qaida and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
After the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could cost more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving the money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director General of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loans will ultimately be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's credits are charged.
However, the interest charged in the interim will be charged each year to the 700 financial corporations that accept the deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted discreetly ... are now being called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less transparent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold and that companies together had to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will rise to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to raise £81 million for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is a pity that those institutions that have acted prudently during the real estate acquisition are now called up to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less transparent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the recording was made in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 will cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will fall for a full year and this could be almost double that much.
As construction companies are both non-companies, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk will cost five pence per litre
People on Jersey are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it would raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after a consultation company's investigations have been carried out.
Retailers themselves should decide whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, Jersey Milk’s wholesale price changed last year.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh rejects bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the bailiff refused to press charges against 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was the prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released early this month against bail.
Sheikh Hasina was scheduled to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the transitional government grant her unlimited freedom at first.
The correspondents say that although their detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear whether they can continue to stay on foot if they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's decision.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says that she does not have to get bail because she is already in detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the Supreme Court."
Their lawyers argue that they need bail to return from abroad to the country in order to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami-Bondis-Chairman on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the military-supported transitional government had taken over power, but had been released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against them.
Threats about the anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan
In Afghanistan's latest anti-pollution initiative, almost 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence brought into contact with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations launched an immunization programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to one UN spokesman, this was the case despite the promise of the Taliban not to attack or prevent the thousands of personnel performing the vaccinations.
BskyB loses complaint in case ITV
BskyB has lost its claim against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
In the past, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's share would distort competition and allow it to have a more unfair influence on the ITV broadcasters.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by renaming NTL, now named in Virgin Media, successfully prevented the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB raises doubts about the independence of the ITV, which the Competition Commission has moved to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, especially because BskyB had announced that he wanted to give up his voting rights.
New investigation at the U.S. State Attorney's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special prosecutor to deal with the abolition of the nine state prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The case was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that lawyers have been removed for political reasons.
Special Agent Nora Dannehy is now going to clarify whether the investigators interviewed during the investigation have angels to prevent justice.
Serious proposals including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appeal of a special mediator with the power to force witnesses to speak was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when in December 2006 the Ministry of Justice took nine U.S. state lawyers from their offices.
At that time the Ministry argued that public prosecutors would be released due to weak work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed state prosecutors were not judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the announcements as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking members of the Republican Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of the electoral fraud of the Democrats.
US U.S. Attorneys are thus mandated to investigate and prosecute cases for the government.
They can be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been tried for dismissals and has ultimately deposed his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also announced.
In particular, the Inspector General's report addressed the role of Gonzales by bearing the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, "surrendering" his leadership role and "extraordinaryly uninterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former Chief Counsellor of President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticised for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song should be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf will be honored during the music award "Q Award" for its epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold price next week in London during the ceremony, said that he would be honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the track for Meat Loaf's Hitler album from 1977.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for the award this year after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there are some songs that go beyond such matters as time and gender and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song appeared in Britain as a single for sale in 1979 and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charters and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heart beats after he was broken up on stage.
In 2007, he had to give up concerts due to an acute headache.
Later it was known that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alleys, side roads and other roads, some of which are famous and others are just comfortable.
However, it is even hard to tell experienced taxi drivers and long-term local residents where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small street is located in the East Village and runs from the First Street to the North between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty gas than after an active transit route.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to retrace Extra Place to create a clean passage to the stores and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshipers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that it is fascinated by the short gas simply because it is one of the remnants of the house block's past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Committee on the Land Use of the municipality this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have proposed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented in the coming month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipality 3.
"Only very little room is left in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers of how to repair the road and operate what Avalon could do, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that a small street was set up and seats designed, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent a room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it doesn't want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this waste gas and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Protection Department, thought it was actually the city's desire to sell the road and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the property rather than to manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road was named in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of the CBGB Music Club, the Punkrock Memorial, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly most famous for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of trash, lumens and parts of barrels, posters, sheets and wires.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the genification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as it is, should remain as modest as it is.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare – a practically unchanged divider of the city, which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (titled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), published part of the city's story about Extra Place, which was published in the 1952 magazine "The New Yorker".
The author, Brendan Gill, then wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow baghole that remains dark even over the day and is marked by reddish metal doors of storage halls, closed windows and raindrops over flying weekly newspapers."
With few exceptions, the road looked exactly as soon as it was in the evening.
A rat went through the back of the road, not far from the door that led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty bottle of beer was on the ground not far from a fresh bunch of arranged newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be cleaned up.
Fields, added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the roadside in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and stupid.
Debates on bilingual education: education in the English language environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, leader of scientific staff in California studies and director of the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why does the middle class need a school choice?"
Addressing the Spanish voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's suggestions on education are a typical example.
Obama's campaign mentioned that "the probability of successful completion of the school among African-American and Hispanic students is lower than among white students" - which is correct.
In order to close this distance of performance, Obama's education plan recommends, among other things, a two-lingual transition in training for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question remains whether Obama’s use of bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in other languages than English, is contrary to his interest in reducing the distance from school.
Consider, for example, "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, 100 percent of students in the fourth grade had passed the state examination in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year were rated as well in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on verification and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach after which education takes place in an English-language environment. That is exactly the point that Obama should take into account, as did the school’s teacher Linda Mikels.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of English in faculty teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later you would enter the classroom and no longer be able to recognize him.
"It works," she noticed, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students?
The school's performance would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "English only".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the distance of performance, he should take into account carefully training models that work instead of denying them and trivializing them.
The oil price decreases as a result of again worrying about the economy
On Monday, due to the fears that even the US Financial Markets Rescue Plan could not be enough to revitalise the economy.
The New York Stock Exchange's crude oil-term stores fell by 7 percent in the morning to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has been reduced by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and by strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices had reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to increase again as a result of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were concerned once again, although convention representatives had announced that they would have agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the biggest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis had not yet been completed.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citigroup is expected to buy the bank transactions of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European Financial Group fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the intense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appears that it failed to revive the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to decline further.
Analysts of the German Bank have written to investors in a communication that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they will continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus spreads worldwide, especially to China."
The bank’s analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the following year and reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Indignant Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had spent the last eight and a half years more often than anyone else in the Jets Trikot.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned a resultless game into a triumphal procession.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
After a slimy game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponds to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-year touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon on which their developing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two other touchdowns, which once equipped as an external defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of half-time.
"I didn't make a lot of effort," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Cole were playing prisoners, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis started a convulsive throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and started him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then made sure that Warner was lost.
The last ball loss, forced on Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets defeated the ball and turned Jay Feelly a 20 Yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points that the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, replied: "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the two answers, because the jets in the third quarter made 21 points without one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Splendid Gebrselasia beats its world record
Hail Gebrselasia from Ethiopia has shown again why some hold him as the best long-term runner of all time after he broke his own record in Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to reach the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59 Gebrselasie improved his previous result from 2:04:26 in 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselasia, 35, has thus established his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least one world championship title or set a world record on each track from one mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasia released the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, out of fear, which may have been exacerbated in the aftermath that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - Gebrselasia has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners such as Gebrselasia and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched to long distances, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen for more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselasie reported to the press, he would have had seizures in his van two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently he was refreshed after a break and didn't come back rusty.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything is perfect.
I resumed my training a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end everything was great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for orchestrating his races excessively, many of the world's best marathon stars generally avoid relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a train race, and putting world records over the competition.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of gebrselasias as long-term runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselasie had reached the center of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselasia after leaving the Tempomachers.
A little over three miles before the finish, Gebrselasie made his last entry to separate from Kwambai, who arrived as the second at 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Deutsche, has completed a remarkable year by showing at 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She has missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as back injury. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She has been planning her course by only leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners out of the way, but after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kippo from Kenya arrived third at 2:25:01.
The pride and the traps in the lives of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the growth of the leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glimmering, loud and gigantic drivings, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black town in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet places, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are at the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that it describes – and it made it a tourist destination by taking it to the Florida Travel Guide, which was produced at the time of the depression by the Federal writer project – in many respects a place of the very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, zealous and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what's going on with him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on racial relations, many are still sad to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a town resident and a community member of the oldest church in the city.
There must be a vote."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of the triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 people, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
On the one hand, it is a highburg of literature and on the other hand an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and on the skin.
And so rightly the concerns about Eatonville's image began with Zora, as here all Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that came from hearts and were written in oral form, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Freich as Oskar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston reader led to the loading of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "there is the brown-white-coated modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, to which Howard Miller always cares, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Drinks of all kinds sell and what-also-always fit into hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus linked Eatonville with self-esteem, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things the way they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls named Hurston, quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty, who were full of sexual toys.
She added, "Many people didn't like this."
You still remember Hurtson here as a lively eccentric woman who returned regularly after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to the city, she did this mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that itself today pictures something on its honorable style.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, and many despised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while he was shaking in his chair, on a back terrace looking at the Sabelia Lake, in which Hurston of all probability was baptized after.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and broke her books.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no big memorial, no public readings in the big style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turnout came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the 4 motorway through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racism brought hatred into the Community.
"At this time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and evidence on the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel to force the Supreme Court's claim to integration by calling its decision against the school council "politically respecting my race".
Today, residents say that although the abolition of racial divisions was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of its young people.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember - they hugged their teachers in the morning and hugged their teachers in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business director of the utility group to protect the Eatonville Community.
This could be maintained for so long, added them until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists, who turned their backs on prejudices, as they did, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975 the writer Alice Walker made a nameless grave on his way to Hurston and began to fight for the revitalization of her fame.
Five years later, a very popular Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelfs, and it again became part of the American literary canon.
The road project came at just the right time, in which Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the festival.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track road gave life to the city, speeded up the whole with peak speed, aroused real citizen pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said something simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There has been more and more travel, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church since 1993, and locals have begun to reassess the past.
Eatonville was entered in the national historical register in 1998.
A new library (called after Hurston of course) opened in 2006 at the newly plastered and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still unique in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can sometimes feel like a back gas in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She is today 90% black.)
Externally looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a Weissen and represented by black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival was growing, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Above all, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, as proud, creative and industrious, but varied and blended like any other race and people in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who planned to return after college to Eatonville to work in the city administration or with the police, who could use some help, according to him.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only go through here will think, "Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, you speak fluently.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspapers and violent television screens in the Times Square, they would not even notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe box-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York have had the worst horror work day ever since the 1929 Stock Exchange Tour.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal tea carts along the citizens' ladders and transporting tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still crawling between apartments, as human packers are loaded with the 50 t-shirts attached to a joch-like stick lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for the meals on the steps of the citizens on their breakfast bag and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19 hours.
It did not feel at all like a crisis until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon, due to all the World War II.
Although I had decided to place my duty temporarily on the quiet afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, about 20 people were already standing.
Not to the money changers to collect or deposit money, but to the customer service switch where stock customers order cheques, tourists ask for the way to the purchase house Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employees with license", stood for the same reason as I snake.
However, unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from which they were hanging, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from the so-called trifts (a little like a building park), associated banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers as family.
Last year, 15 of these banks were silent and silent.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went over and as the last Friday New Yorker went home over the weekend, was another bank that has $440 billion savings in search of a rescue buyer.
In fear of another crash, the office and cargo officers brought their bar before me to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have adapted to the current financial Latin in the last few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese home market took so much privacy with reference to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went to the bank, and the board president Dick Full, who looked down on them, as if she would be laughing at a false colleague.
And Lyn, who around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my dwelling block has come from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Mushrooms of Muslim graveyards during judicial procedure in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Right Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Deventer, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, participates in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organization "city against Islamism".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is painted, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse law-enforcement extremists of burial at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extreme right-wing party record significant gains in the country's parliamentary elections.
On the night of Friday this morning, more than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials hold this as an attempt to veil the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the event is in any way connected with the elections.
A speaker from the local Islamic community said she was "too deeply shocked" about the news of the burial which took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan at the end.
At the same time, there is a round of knowledge research in Austria after the country moved to the right in the elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which received almost 30% of the votes from both far right-wing parties, took part in their election campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their election languages were criticized by opponents as hostile.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, took part in a ban on headaches and burkas and even made his denial of food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and mines with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections and the statements that the extreme rights of the country's most politically strong bloc are indicated that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel block for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star who was convicted of the sexual abuse of children, was legally forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Glitter set up a six-month ban after informing the authorities controlling him of his intention to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were granted a ban on foreign travel last Thursday after presenting to the judges evidence of Glitter's pretrial punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the correct name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Office in Kent, but was represented by the lawyer's office Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday 25 September, the police of Kent at the Ashford Court asked permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also has to notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
The police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible residence in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"Our view is that it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the police's top concern in Kent to protect the residents of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country in order to minimize any risk that may exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport check and he flew to one place and here to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused his entry and fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived in Heathrow on August 22nd at Terminal 3 and remained there during his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's office in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter was previously arrested in 1999 for 4 months in the United Kingdom for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was satisfied and satisfied that Glitter had been kept from travelling to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter brewer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no jokes, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the large flame cotanizers that refuse to concentrate and dedicate themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in these moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find typical gestures for the person, the depth of a stolen look or the strength of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents various theatre performances on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame-coding at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of Flamenco's photography, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is increasing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flemenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to maintain the personality of these artists, you do not have to take pictures on stage.
Her personality and character is in her heart.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to maintain the characters of the greatest flamecomers with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', took a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, photos have been created that remind you of classic photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classic basis of the image, thereby giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the Farmer Flamenco understands, to be given: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises each day'.
These are not just the dance, the song or the instrumental play on themselves, but the personality of the artist, his character, which with his art seduces the audience.
The search for the essential, for something that becomes visible in the form of the hearing, of being, and was the fixed goal of this work, which is presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the near future.
Known characters in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists that have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to realize it as "portraits of the veterans of sport" ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flemenco-people' are different, the photographer likes it very much to photograph people, to get to know them and to move me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or longer.
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You meet or hit people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you for a few minutes alone to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the Flamenco of today with the title 'Flemenco-people' is shown in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located on the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says that the Rome he's just writing is "a great skill."
He still does not know where the action of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying hard to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the favorite Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is dealing with is "a customs know-how" and "everything indicates that he should not write the novel".
'If I were alone, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to sometime end the novel', so he ended his participation at the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciuda y los perros' was one of the most outstanding characters at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and to whom most of the audience gave their vote, is compared to the old edition of ‘Our mutual friend’ and is seen in the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had a audience before him, which noticed that the Peruvian who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humor was not given enough time to go on: how his call for literature came from 'extraordinary adventure desire', from 'frequent reading' and 'more to experience, than before'; how he writes and 'discipline' to supplement the lack of inspiration', how his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his call and what `recorresponds to his stories' are the basis of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is “no way” where one can measure and where one can know whether books change life, “but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a volatile experience”, said Vargas Llosa, who claims that it “produces effects” and “people even more apart”, so I asked the writers “not to give up the ease” and “the responsibility” for his call“take over”.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather didn't play with: Thierkampfests fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in poor condition, the bullfighting party to which the festival should be concluded in Pozoblanco was moved to the morning.
Thus, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to move the bullfight.
Thus, the festival of unsustainable weather was postponed, so two of the three festivals could not be held.
On Saturday it was raining why the second planned beef camp could not be celebrated.
The group of the Matadores consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who entered the bullfighting camp from time to time.
That's how there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after which he had left the pass with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which had succeeded him more by galloping than by his bull's art.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After fighting so badly, most of the audience responded to his second battle with bow calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to get out of control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen called on the car's drivers to stop, from which they took the escape.
It looked as if they should not stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police persecuted her and found one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A. J., as announced by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and the falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the transport police in the region of Álava had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
She decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police began to chase until the car moved a few kilometres on the edge. At the moment, the drivers came out of the car to flee across a rural road to a forest area.
The police of the town of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Haschisch, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with haschich bundles, which were later led to precise laboratory analysis and balance of the bundle to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was ‘double’ so that it did not match the mark given in the Kfz papers, therefore an arrest was also made for the falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue investigations to arrest the second suspect who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the drugs seized.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was taken to a police station, and he will be brought to the courthouse in the next hours.
Actor Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested on this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
One witness observed how she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokespersons of the California traffic police reported to the magazine 'People'.
The Witness explained in detail that Locklear, after 4:30 p.m., pushed the gaspedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forth from the parking lot, and when she drove back, she caught up with her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the witness, who had probably not recognized the actress at the beginning, saw Locklear on a nearby road and walked out the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'feared for Locklears'.
When the police came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was across the street blocking traffic.
'They seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress proved cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was ruled out from the first moment. `The first observations of the officers as a result, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug’, says the spokesperson.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and brought into a local investigation by 7:00 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after treatment from the Arizona clinic, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, chief coordinator of the VL and members of the United Left, has today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will meet the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the Council in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had retired last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take over the responsibility for this', Llamazares pointed out which way the party must be against the one who has so far sat as a city council in the municipality of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rules that Silva could have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
In this regard, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public officials'.
'Banre de Mayo': Helmet of Garci
Inspired by “Episodios Nacionales” by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in “Sangre de Mayo” represents the revised version of the Spanish’s famous rebellion against the French. This is a wonderful film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment for spinning.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to represent a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he has always admired in the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci explained today in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.
'Sangre de Mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in cinemas and later shown on the broadcaster Telemadrid as a four-hour ministry.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures us that thanks to this work, he was in full swing. This was due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to make a memorial film for the second century festival in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because the story was based on `Epidosios Nacionales', he accepted the assignment.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the autonomous Community of Madrid for rotational work, Garci, as he added, offers the 'unique opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of the 'misleading Spain', which chose the wrong leader for the struggle because the people were to be represented by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand VII.
However, the Cineast was unable to calculate with funding such as ‘alatriste’ or ‘Los phantasmas de Goya’ (two times as high as ‘sangre de mayo’), so some scenes from the spinbook with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garcia collaborated almost his entire career, could not be rotated.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', was involved in his usual work: he stood on stage with the actors with whom you first have to try to turn before you start and for those who had not made a casting, he appeared 'demeaning' and showing respect, `part of the film director's profession exists in order to help in the theatre and in the cinema to know what is going on in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many performers he meets in 'Sangre de Mayo' must repeat before his camera, such as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrançaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de Mayo' nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film `Los girasoles ceegos'.
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
At first you believe that you are working for the offspring, later you notice that it is only for the sake of the cause, and now you are satisfied if you have produced another film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamencotender from Seville adores a dancer who also came from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgia Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert on Oriental dance.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and was committed to the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who left behind her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell you about her life, but to preserve her spirit,' said the flamer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly', for example, appeared to me like Guajira, or 'the dance of the snake', like Tango.
Her dance was sensible and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
The scene includes two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel once again in one of her performances, as he did in `La porta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exceptionally with one of her ex-students.
`Mathilde plays Tortola, a very mature person.
I am happy because she agreed to work with me, and I feel very honoured.'
The stage also includes musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Juarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas, in which he is constantly falling in love.'
In this work, we also mention in a certain way the life of this woman, who was known in as far places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she was normally living in London.
'I wanted to recall her, because I think she's one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular era and whose works today are no longer appreciated and so she knows even less', Bayón claims.
The show will take place at 8:30 p.m. in the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poet recién cadado' also includes the trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poet recién cadado' at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez in 1916 Zenobia married, offers a suitable atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triumnium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008).
Thus the Trienium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia House Museum and with the hiking exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'Aquel Chopo de luza', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now arrived and was presented at New York in the course of the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poetice recién cadado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
Without Paul Newman, the United States can imagine itself bad
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in a “sensation reporter”, and from the then ruling performance of the U.S. film that was released at the stake, from all America to Newman with his exciting idea and followed her.
Now look what it cost him to lend him Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a great blow for everyone.
'How one feels sometimes is essentially more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the greatest difficulties of his life.'
No one was afraid to laugh or exaggerate.
As the ‘father’ of the cinema and father country, he died in a sad moment, in fear of terrorists and of market collapse, in which the downtrodden self-esteem of the US Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If, in this hard time without mercy, only a few people who can be admired remain, then you do not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he incorporated almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as gains: from the foundation that wrote down the fight against drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage who died at overdose, he was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
This is all a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to cope with a deadly nutrition culture.
A wide wave of surprise strikes home over Hollywood without regard for nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man had died, but the whole era.
England's Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar Prize winner, said that working with Newman was no more than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of us all,' confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who tried to live faithful today as Paul Newman lived: getting high standards of justice, having a responsible private life, leading far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He was divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, who was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have Philet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily customary in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as that of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the Philanthropy,' they say.
The streets in Madrid are missing for the Olympics.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to hold some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, may be 2016.
But I ask myself, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not right!
It was called the perfect road, and according to my opinion, it was the worst road with everything around and around it.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you would take into account the evaluation and I could check it out, something clearly would not have happened.
But from the start, we're going through everything.
The nonsense starts with the ticket shop, which allows you to go first.
I don't think it's bad either, but if they let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the stasis on the street).
So don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense in which only to go there) and (after an infinite wait) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less material?
Well, things like this are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a wait line of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was expected, the road started and we had not let our backpacks lie ahead, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be harder to retrieve them.
Moreover, in these 40 minutes of waiting after rain, it seemed that it was time to try to organize a mass uprising and attack the house.
I believe that tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip that I have received, I can think that the output has been incorrectly stamped.
Of course, if you were to ask me a perfect road, this road would never fall on me.
So I think we'll still dream of a city that's well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the “Emerging Technology Conference”, held by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of performing some primitive tasks such as ordering a taxi (or in Microsoft's case it is a route planner to move on the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, these "receptionists" can recognize how many people are in space, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also arrange the participants after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation, "the receptionist" notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that leads the conversation with her, and that she is also not a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will be listening soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
I'm sure that's the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week you talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computer was equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling it with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be only for the few.
Everything is just a statement when you think that Microsoft in Windows versions added one or more functions and `Extras'.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses meaning, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared online, it was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Sent to many point out that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his or her spouse when it comes to communicating something to his or her mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his “death”, not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'window' environment.
What is the use of half of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so excessive, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more about integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
Actually, they need it, no doubt. I'll give you a little example.
I took the picture of this place in Redmond, one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refresher drink machine a sign is attached: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for online research.
By the way, last week, it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso held it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wearing this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built priest.
If we start to count the countless stars performances, then we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a sharp bart that had raised weight in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, unarmed and trilled.
The Englishmen call it 'tank'. However, Ms Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all the other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called in the close circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name stand is linked to sport and originated by the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' is superior to all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that have these T-shirts as a detail on the neck.
And attention, the Belgian company not only concentrates on the production of ‘tanks’.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with strips, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's very bad to use them as underwear.
You're very funny.
'I want to be a young mother. I don't worry about the candidate.'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is beautiful, but full of joy of life.
At present, the Gruz brothers take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved her home and also made the presentation of the most important awards in the fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Compassive and shy, winner on the short route.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner to Valentine's Day.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I am fascinated by the cinema of the 1950s and 1960s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and watch women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, which I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, it all happens in one area and these areas have many commonities.
Ever since I was little, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to wrap around my aunt’s clothing and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I was always trying to keep an eye on the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in teaching and testing to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You've just been 30 years, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, what?
I feel better than ever, I feel better than 30 years old.
I find that the woman is mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been doing since I was little, and that's given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think you're going to be a mother, don't you?
I've known for a long time that I'm going to be a mother because that's what my body requires and I want to be a young mother; I won't let it go.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will convey to my child great happiness and bring it up with great love.
As for the film art, you keep in mind the work you took part in last year.
That is exactly the case and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and anxious and wants everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that ‘La last watch’ and ‘En busa de la tumba de Cristo’ will be listed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them.
A few days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
If you're okay, don't say something like that.
It's not like I went up the stairs to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango were auctioned to raise money for Naomi’s NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There are a lot of things about her, and I, like the one who knows her, would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handle, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is needed.
Drivers who can be returned due to alcohol levels will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The Authority arranges that the driver who had three official penalties for drinking alcohol installed in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunken state. If he is drunk, the car does not start.
The initiative was announced in June last month and is already part of the report of the Attorney General. According to its report, it is a pilot project that will last a year.
The aim is to resocialise the driver, which is why the driver receives a course for the resumption of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the General Public Prosecutor's Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Technical Institute for the Safety of Vehicles will participate.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of drivers who were more than once exposed to alcohol influence were taxed again.
The 'alcohol' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the out-of-air and prevents autostart when the driver has made an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs are borne by those who are liable to the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices already prevent up to 65% of the infringements in the first year after their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take action before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be carried out in the ordinary way, yet a reform of the basic law is required for the prosecution process.
The device is still on the Spanish markets, not available in any business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
On the basis of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, the House will vote tomorrow. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., in addition to the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez de México DF Airport, the Spanish Air Force aircraft landed with the President and President of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair coming out of the plane.
Direct at Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the princes of Asturias were visiting the city to formalise the official journey.
- Oh, very well, so, you can't take people to the airport at this time you're from here or something.
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Oh, that's good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers, who deliver the honorsalve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long-winded hair, without normal 'peep-toes', may have been informed that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the room, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are located, one of the four largest in the city, there is a reporter waiting for her from Mexican television, who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of the mode
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designers and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Boton-Mango Fashion Awards' to promote and internationalise young fashion talent.
This is awarded at a cash price of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday, the Belgian winner of the first edition, Ayer Sandrina Fasoli saw her drawings in the Mango branch window on Boulevard Haussmann 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have happened, which are linked to the desire to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury in the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board of directors organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain because his brother had recently died, got together. He drew the suit from the fashion house and wore some jewelry from ELAH that were stunning. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters old and who accompanied Valentino to the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a gentleman, so he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without Jackets, because Jackets loaned the ladies.
Monica Cruz, she went to the store and had a shirt and shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she showed us a room for ballet tests, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a rod and made a sort of ‘great plee’.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the rooms of the palace, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to rejoice over the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who has always caused a stormy excitement, and on Jon Travolta, who, after arriving (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, had in advance asked to have a room without smell.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against Stress
There is not 1000, but a more possibility to forget chaotic everyday life.
And even if there are few, everyone is gathered in a book where it says how to get relief. The book comes into the book deals on September 30.
The waker is a punishment when it sounds at 7:00 a.m., but even worse, the idea appears to get back into the hectic rhythm that requires the current life.
The office is called the voltage and the computer that leads to the back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two ways to combat the daily accumulation and the problems of turning off the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga placements, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the full list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 opportunities to relax' and so the peace that conveys the book comes into the book proceedings of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to reach peace in areas such as workplaces with the help of personal contacts, this handbook contradicts such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or propose the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins is no longer elevated to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to put itself on the sofa, turn off the brain and concentrate on reading.
Talk in sleep
Some children talk at night
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, at best you'll be scared, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and adolescents.
Of course, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ), on the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is no single reason why this appears.
Often relationships are sought with other appearances in sleep, such as alpine dreams, panic at night, Enuresis noctura (bunk nights), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we have mentioned earlier, it may be very high fiber, stress situations, or overstatement.
Anyway, it's a little bit of a researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, wine, long discussions ).
In cases where the statement is very intensive, it is recommended to observe the child and to consult with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus becomes a condition.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated unless it is linked to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoe or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Do not try to reach the child before sleeping.
So choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and something too wild.
For the nervous children recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child sleep quietly.
If the speech occurs in sleep once, try to keep the rest.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and on the next day it will be impossible to remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake it up.
That's useless, because the child is unconscious, and you're going to get rid of it.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it relaxes.
Think about it if you are afraid after a few appearances, it is recommended to consult or find out why the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on to conduct an understanding and get more information.
This way you will not be able to achieve anything, because if the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Also, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Houses ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Ill houses on the playing field are finally back at a successful course.
Without great effort, the yellow-blacks had many torts and made it possible to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, when the attackers were struggling to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose television shot hardly passes at the corner, Ill-houses should easily dominate the game, and it was able to alternately only flick with a television shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a gun with a foottip to challenge the defence of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half of the period should be decisive with first two Torchants fought by Riahi and Temporal, and then with the first door for the Illhauser by Marais, who was right enough to accept again a ball which had been rejected in a first attempt by the Diebold.
However, the innkeeper should not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and be sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, so that his teammates would have to continue to play on a large number of subjects.
However, Denmark did not know how to use this, and an Illhaeusian Elve did not face any major problems, which only slightly withdrew to defend it to 'enclose', except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball went after a great crossroads very close to the latte.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another mark in Britain.
In view of the fishermen's determined attitude, which blocked access to several ports of Breton and Norman, the French President decided to meet with their representatives there at the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive him “with a constructive spirit” and hope that he would come with “concrete suggestions”.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee set up by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in this price, which has reached an average of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press spokesman of Elyséepalasts David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their company become competitive again and to ensure the working conditions and payment of the seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led in the Morbihan and Calvados protest marches, which caused the stasis of almost ten kilometers long.
The coast of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break.
The peninsula of Quiberon was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors express their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the Armal Canal, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not export, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved in the evening the blockage of the significant total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting at the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsible national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not be allowed to go anywhere' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient, announced.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 as a result of cancers in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes all agreed to the playwright and the committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds its delivery forecasts for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer estimates 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threatening recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, supports its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size order from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurance company American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering spending more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars it received.
AIG is willing to direct the sale of a large part of its business, on its international life insurance and age care in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
The AIG could not obtain confirmation.
The assets of the AIG that might be separated include its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, its real estate assets and its investments in private equity, the FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make sales as soon as possible in order to repay the loans over 85 billion which it has granted to the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of its capital and the current shareholders will lose the same amount.
Analysis Historic Paris meeting Historic morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historic case of the courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasda 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the date of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final discharge figures, the Nasdag index, mainly with regard to technology, is reduced by 199.61 points to 1,983.73 points, and the widely distributed Standard&Poors index 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which should once again allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 votes against, the MPs refused the financial secretary Henry Paulson the means for which he had prayed.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'Here's a bad picture that makes the Congress incapable of adopting a plan', said Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added them, and fears that a project adopted in several days 'too late' will come.
If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, etc. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis into the grip, which would limit the credit conditions even more", warned Brian Bethune, Head of Business at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed that she emphasized the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day she spends, she brings the ruin of a financial company' to the United States.
After the Washington Mutual competition on Friday, the US authorities planned to buy the bank shops of Wachovia through its Citigroup competitor.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated suddenly and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets were not just facing an American but a global crisis, the analyst added the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenues of the State Fund within ten years fell from 3,632% on Friday evening to 3,827% on Friday evening and the revenues within 30 years last night from 4,161% on 4,357% on Friday evening.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV show
After the first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday, another one followed to find out who was the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television show to be followed by a third of American families, both Republicans and Democrats.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite visible, was not 'brillant' enough to enable him to stop his decline in election questions five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to Obama with five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
In the case of the still undecided voters, that is, those on which it is now coming, Obama emerged with 39% as the winner from the polls, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them viewed McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm its advance on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but this weekend Bill Clinton warned.
The seventies-old McCain did not stop to put his unmistakable experience in the field of foreign policy in the foreground, and in doing so clearly stressing the 'Naivity' of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first television show.
' Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,' he also said.
A point of attack which has been preached since yesterday in the Republican polls.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and accurately without being brought out of the version.
He put his ability in the foreground to make good decisions and to renew the picture the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood Obama, on the other hand', this weekend opposed a democratic election campaign in which Republicans were proposed not to be able to understand the full extent of the crisis on which 'Americans are loaded from the street'.
During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama urged 20,000 people yesterday, who had gathered in torrential rains at an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'mediately' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which Americans consider to be the most appropriate thing to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The coming week could be a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final part of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After again stressing that he would perhaps even create a reduction in taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of the country's potential energy independence and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was of the highest priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates abstained from the question of saving the financial market of over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted last night by the Congress and was extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?'
Youth and opposition demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to deny the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred white Russians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the poll at Minsk's market place to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should come back'.
Some say that they haven't even chosen: 'What does it profit if they do it with my voice,' says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has proved itself to the foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-participation of Visa for 40 leading Belarusian persons and the disposal of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census', said Juri Potemkin, a press spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, says Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If the opposition Members join Parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their involvement in Parliament can mean time spent on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is therefore guilty of engaging in the political process, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which Russia is heavily indebted to, is in a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a Russian protectorate.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, does not recognise the election as valid.
She stressed that the voter participation numbers were too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of the Minsk voters) paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
Have you noticed that there has been an election?, asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, namely those who are most in line with the ideas of the government.
The calm of the night descends again over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission wish them success.
Discussion - From the blood that has become safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her founding, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the world's safest and most efficient blood banks.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which has been severely shaken by the scandal of the tested blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross were infected during the 1980s with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to draft directives to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While judges Krever still hesitated to submit his report, several provinces then set up a committee on the legs whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood cans in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
When hema-Quebec took up her work in 1998, almost 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through the work in this area during the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, before she proudly stresses that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary maintains in his consciousness that ‘trust is something extremely fragile’.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution.
At this time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been leading since the foundation of 1998.
And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we recommend one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which, according to which exclusive measures are applied, if you do not know this, and if a disease only progresses slowly, as is obviously the case in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease would be transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we are applying has absolutely no meaning.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: the nuclear acid test (NST), which enables the donor to directly detect the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the previously used tests.
The NST allowed it to shorten the incubation time between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced for a period of less than one week.
So the risk of certain donors being infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements enabled the risk of transmission of AIDS via a blood transfusion to a significant extent.
Today, one out of 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood cans should be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV was transmitted via a blood can.
I believe that today you can feel better when you get a blood transfusion or prescribed to restore health," says Hema-Quebec's head of management.
Our challenge for the next ten years is to get the security of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year has the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects through the blood.
We need to monitor continuously', Dr. Décary continues, before she stresses that hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
The need is rising because the population is getting older.
Because cancer treatment is more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donation network, which on average only 3% of the population of Quebec eligible for blood donation.
Every healthy person who is 18 or older and fulfils the criteria of suitability can contribute blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who make their blood available are not accepted because they are ill with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who are travelling to a country where malaria is common are excluded from blood donation for one year.
With this 3%, we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing stocks are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep it and to make it regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour on blood donation," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood preserves, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyelids and skin, which are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public nail blood bank Quebec.
In the navel cord that was previously considered biomedical waste, there is plenty of blood in stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth Navel blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
'We should probably start at the beginning of next year to make it available for transplants', explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program as a very popular one.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and cost-effective program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact on the Half-final
Montreal's Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all the gates), against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decisive game of the fourth final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the total score was counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the final games of the first league of the USL.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive door in the nineties.
After a first half without a gate for both the one and the other side, the middle field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the formation of Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who set Matt Jordan on the road to the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the pre- and back series on Friday impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had placed a 2 to 1 landing in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-final, impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps were still in the semi-final round with a total tor ratio of 5 to 4.
The impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - winner by Kovalev
The number 1-Trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn launched the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Costitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a door, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this game, the fourth of the tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only door of the whole shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game so I can feel it.'
In the first half of the day, he fixed too much on it, Guy observed carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He got a stormy hit.'
Charest sets in the north
The Prime Minister does not refuse to open elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general meeting of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Linke) tried to be elected in today's sub-election.
`Move the course of our last great border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his speech, a sort of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens spectacular pictures of hydroelectric power plants, mining plants, viewed by Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large means such as during the election period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would hold the elections this fall, even though he said that his timetable was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely a 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has often been mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech in recent years, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th degree - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North `a jewel with enormous potential' was, but did not call a date, no amount of investment or precise priorities for future projects.
At the top of some views on what could be done more: mainly on water energy, on the forest, but especially in the mining sector, is benefiting from the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to the census, Mr. Charests owns the North `Nickel, Zinc, Copper, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Iron, Titan and even Diamonds'.
This 'area twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is within us', he stressed how to clearly show that he is looking for a national founding dream to come true.
Quebec grew very much by its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technology Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after he had put in a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister of the press said against.
'This is a traditional attitude that all governments persecuted.
There is a borderline in which there has been no agreement for a very long time when the opportunity is offered, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
Moreover, ‘with the climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north’, he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be viable due to ice melt all year round.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely an obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would treat them very gently and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Pekist MP of Ungava) have already initiated consultations with some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land resources) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity in which 'one will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North Plan will be ‘declared, regulated and environmentally friendly’, he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as if it were a continuation of those liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
Like the Liberals before us in the office, we have planned to turn the challenges into new growth and development change.
This was also one of the ever-increasing themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party for the 50th anniversary of taking over the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the power plant of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godboudum.
'From Godbout, who created the Hydro-Quebec, about the reading that reached the silent revolution and the state of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James-Buch, our party always knew how to determine the future,' said Jean Charest.
The press was referring to another conservative project this time, namely the program ‘Roads to the North’ by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project water power staudamm Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that it was planned to start in 2012.
'It remains among us, but I am about to be there', he trusted his party members, which resulted in those accident storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and of course in 2009, has in fact not yet been able to hold this autumn an election which is possible from the law.
He stresses, however, that his timetable is full, especially because of a mission from the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend general meeting provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially 'Constitution-related objectives', which were adopted without further adoption: the PLQ calls in particular for the recognition of the 'Speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council and to have a veto regarding the decisions that Quebec has taken.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were taken up with skepticism.
The leader of the Québec Party, Pauline Marois, has again highlighted the policy of developing the North-du-Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to use it.
If she had done so, ‘we are still much further today’, Ms. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a North plan by the government.
'But what we want is that this will not only become a big idea,' said the party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letter - A country of origin
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (which irony) at Harper's Cabinet, it was the last summer that allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a "slander" for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not taken their countryman captive in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even consider Omar Khadr to be even more young than the things that have happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetated under inhuman conditions.
The only thing that turns out to be a parody of justice is to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are especially complaining about getting Omar Khadr home to get him a fair trial in Canada.
Exactly this government also closes its eyes to the torture: it is not interested that a young adult after so many years of age will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not aware of it yet, but we are experiencing here a domestic cut-off of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, the harper always bears a flag before him, and that sounds so unfavorable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morale anymore: a Canadian citizen may be arbitrarily abused, tortured and imprisoned, according to the good deeds of a government chief, who is only supported by the minority (maybe he belongs to the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that their salvation will be found in a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has given itself up to the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this dissolution, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwell speech of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devor published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwelling logic that the world's largest gold-making company sought to open a 'public transparent debate' with more than six million authors and a small unmediated publishing house.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of insults, but in the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely obscured by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone into the ruin that is waiting to represent one of their opposing views.
Just as the process begins, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of goldmines.
The tactics of these unequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a unanimous regime that makes the opposite side dead and also scares anyone who is waiting to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to present her views to the public.
In contrast to what is happening in many of the countries where Barrick Gold is working, there are usually debates in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through nuisance.
It would have been enough, therefore, if the gold mines had revealed their books and documents and had opened a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have any confidence in public opinion and deletes the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and, at the same time, reject the views of this public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world covers only those lawyers who have been paid generously, and not the community of all Canadians; a very good conclusion to the concept.
In a democracy, ridiculers themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mines.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that perceives many as a nuisance complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it requires them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth that is fundamental to every democratic society.
It totally denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by Noir Canada's authors.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long known to get debates and disagreements in the grip and to resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate complaint by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what she is proposing, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that limit this kind of unjustifiable complaint.
Rescue Action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Similarly, the Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of over 700 billion US dollars to stop the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two congress chambers.
The main content is: a better control of Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new arrangements to reduce the number of houses found due to outstanding payments, and the right to monitor the holdings paid to the management staff of the firms supported.
US Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be marketable,' said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
'Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis at Wall Street,' said the democrat.
'This is the basic point: If we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the everyday life of Americans will be enormous,' said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, fear of the effect that a new failure would have had on investors' mood.
The deadline agreed was that market opening this morning.
The two US presidential candidates who had only recently participated in the negotiations proved rather to be advocates of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they had to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama was at the addendum of certain provisions for the agreement, especially those that would enable the owners to keep their houses, and those that relate to the salaries of the executive employees of the state-saved company.
If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibleness of certain persons, that is nothing you could wish for.
But these measures are necessary', he said on American television.
When asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: ‘I would like to know the details, but I hope so.
The guidelines that I have read show that this is a thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to get ahead.
The option, even nothing to do, is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is focused on the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the placement of a real estate blast, which first led to the collapse of the risk-rich mortgage loans (subprime) before extending to other forms of extended bonds (PCAA), and finally into a freeze of financial power and into the ruins of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican Members failed to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain ‘toxic’ assets of the companies in distress should only be secured by the government and not purchased, it is believed that the bag gas has escaped.
In order to round out the perspectives for all in the Congress, a provision has also been added that, if the government should lose this programme within five years, it would be possible to raise new taxes in order to retain its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to be added to the remaining 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved in a new vote by the Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him in the case of dividends, and which can sell it again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to suspend the suspension procedures for the apartments which are linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and also to set deadlines for repayment and settlement payments to the managers of the companies concerned.
The plan's developers would like the House of Representatives to vote against it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all her efforts, it is not yet certain that her plan will get green light.
In fact, there were more votes against this project yesterday, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
'It's obvious Washington doesn't understand us,' said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it is not those who are in it to ask the taxpayers for cash.'
The democratic MP Brad Sherman, the leader of a group in Congress called the ‘Caucus of the Skeptics’, is different, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred distinguished economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote us to inform us: We ask the Congress not to be pressured, and to think carefully about the way to go,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe again received evidence that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partially nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refuse to buy up its competitors, which has been in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis through the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and belongs to the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
'It is not lost money,' said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate we receive a right of choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced.'
During that time, the British government was on the other side of the Armal Canal just trying to reach another bank instigated by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all existing loans at Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be after Northern Rock the second bank that the British government has had to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have kept him away from a power that really brings fear to the world.
But what a great runner!
On Friday at the age of 83, Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he had been a sort of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his play, certainly more destructive, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-speaking mother.
Its European roots should form one of the most famous faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality features.
Because in him was a whole country that was in love with the self-made-man, in the fighters who were injured in fighting in the Pacific War, who studied the beginning of the 50th year of art in Yale and then visited the actor's studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on TV and soon in the cinema.
Just like this man who fought for civil rights, he was also the driver who became at Mans Second's 24 hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a predictive relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also disappears the unknown facets of this mysterious, withholding, committed, and oversensitive star to the glamour of the show business, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans moved the movie lovers this weekend to Taumel, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change moves forward with it.
The charming Cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes back to the memory, and the young man who left his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot sheet roof, which was filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
A much shorter reminder (1990) will be called to mind, to his sensitive Mr Bridge, who is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises in his old age.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full of shit) by Robert Wise, a role that James Dean had thought of, was re-enacted after his death and the Newman in 1956 was quite well known.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded with the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
As an envious and ambitious billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, it was him.
He's still here.
In his course of life, epochs unite.
The youth knows him primarily from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brother Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as the path of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several filmmakers who had withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time and betray Hollywood, his assets, his prune and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he judged his performances to be too expressive.
The meter was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles had only flown for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an external player: neurotics, alcoholics, fiddles or doubters, with which he reflected his perfect representation of his delicacy and his excitement.
As director, Newman revealed unknown aspects of his true sensitivity.
His 1968 Rachel (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) and his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role drew a fine portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated this 1984 film to Harry and Son, a work of fine feeling and sadness.
At the flood of honours yesterday about Newman ergoss, his close friend and former gun companions Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said extremely: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential qualities of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great prosecutor of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the Hollywood occupation, goes there.
We may have seen him with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrettes, in sauces, pastries, or other foods, and this made it quite tasteless, although we still found it fun at first.
However, the profits from its turnover flowed into its Children's Foundation in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman took part in the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these phrases: `Always and to the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good stars.
It was an honor to be here.'
And it was an honor for us to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of supplement &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János's attack and his accomplices began.
In particular, the defendant is accused of engaging in organised crime, as well as serious serious damage and fraud, and other criminal offences - including document fraud.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds secured by the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often backed up by false accounts.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be partly poured into the funds of the organization Fiatal Balldal, partly into the individual private funds.
As announced by the investigating authorities, fictitious accounts have been presented in relation to the tendering money and the associations should not have complied with their obligations either.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices have been false.
The billing blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision to issue the invoices to companies was decided on that round trip north of the Lake Plattensee, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should discover pensions and restaurants.
He asked for bills on consumption to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These calculations should have been handled mostly by István Lados and his accomplice András Hijri, who should have been responsible for the drafting of the relevant reports, according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' "Experience Tour" was a beer resort.
As two of the invoices issued in 2003 and Co are to be taken into account, the gastronomy company is expected to host the nine-headed group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But now the head of the company indicates that such a large group would not even fit into the room.
Another bill, issued in summer 2002 at the Jobb Jövõért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate not more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are expected to stay.
Apparently, the fantasy of account fraud was not limited to the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy operation in which the customer documents Job Jövõért and Hoppá, according to the Prosecutor's Office, did not appear until.
As the manager of the company, Mr Farkas of Hvg.hu, informed him immediately that it was false documents when documents were submitted to him by the Public Prosecutor's Office during an inquiry.
"Our company name and the tax number were incorrectly affixed to the stamp."
And further: Apart from form errors, it was also wrong that the company should have accommodated hundreds of people after having a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to accommodate as many people.
The restaurant has also been on the bill for a long time, and the restaurant has been out of operation.
The emsay accountants have also failed to verify that the Budapest office that they took as their visa offers exclusively travel abroad, and thus they have indicated Hungarian travel on the cash account, which is also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As was known in the course of the investigations, they have also added value added tax to the accounts, although travel services which relate to a country outside the EU are free of VAT.
The amount of VAT was totaled on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövõért Foundation as the operation was calculated instead of only 15 percent VAT, and only machine invoices were issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another error that was being made by the "accounting company" was that in a case they had stated "goods transport" as a performance, although this is not offered by the investment advisory company, the Public Prosecutor informed.
Other forms errors - wrong accounting format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to the XXI. Századi Cultural Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be cleared as falsifications.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managers judged never to issue the bills.
Another "error" is the falser at the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza: this company was in a resolution at the time (2001) precisely when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület had to eat there - the mass administrator therefore stated that the bills had not been issued by themselves.
Consciously false
The other groups of accounting officers are people who were quite aware that they had to put fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Socialisták, the Ezély Budapest Alapítvány Foundation has issued accounts for the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, at an amount of around HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the manager of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to exhibit the fictitious accounts.
The Biogate Kft. currently in liquidation should also have worked together with additional support and co.: In 2003 the GmbH will have provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny.Egyesület Association with false accounts in the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to unsolicited services.
However, there was also little traffic in payment, as the bills were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but those involved in their documents had forgotten to note.
The third group of accounting officers shall include persons directly connected with the accused.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of the Delta Trió Kft., a company based in Budapest but not found there.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF of about 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, has been the buyer of these accounts.
The manager of this company was a Romanian who should also be given company documents by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov stood during the investigations, invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Atlasz and Hoppá Associations, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have cancelled their own countervalue.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. should have been founded by Romanian walls on Ivan Kubatov's express wish.
In fact, however, these companies were not active, according to the defendant on missing orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his associate, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who had been commissioned to prepare the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the award, such as Atlas and Y-Generácio.
In total, Kubatov has issued 15 accounts in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The Public Prosecutor's Office assumes that Kubatov could have cancelled 10% of the sum of the accounts as well as the VAT.
Kubatov is even supposed to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were accompanied by the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generácio and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért filed their applications with the socialist party’s non-profit organisation, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (‘TMA’).
Both received 500,000 forints, but these amounts were used abroad.
To cover this, they have presented the TMA with five fictitious calculations of the Works Team Kft..
However, these bills were secured in the Ministry of Education when the Office of Árpád Kemecsei was examined.
In the course of the negotiations, some defendants are now charged with an opinion on the procedure of fraud, as they have already been brought before the Public Prosecutor.
A feeling could be if the main defendant, János, decided on a comprehensive confession.
His details were less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still valid.
The question remains whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the reinstatement of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the grant is in return to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the attack is now playing the "damaged" after his search for relief of the arrest and house arrest on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused much more damage to the economy and have not paid them, on their own foot, or at least under house arrest, this option remains denied.
The psychology of excess - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the error bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people don't want to give in to a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others participate in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were studied by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to earn money, however, an increased activity of the Straitum, a complex below the brain, was measured at the loss of the auction, in which the opponent's overcoming played an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore felt that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an over-reaction of the Straitum.
In order to undermine their thesis, the economists in the research group have hired additional research to track the money.
In this case, three groups against a partner should cooperate under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product and then they made their efforts.
In addition to this, another group was promised $15 reward, in case they came out as winners of the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the case of a lost game.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was only that the emphasis was on the one on the gain, while on the other on the loss.
However, as evidence of the assumptions expressed by neurologists, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to make higher efforts than those in the control group or the "gain" group.
"These results cannot be attributed to any previous economic theory.
These have so far justified the behaviours observed in auctions only with the joy of winning, or the avoidance of risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved through the illustrative neurological procedures, so we have now prepared a third statement" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to ask?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed under the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand are treated, which means that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for various virus-induced infectious liver diseases.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the causes and diseases differ.
Depending on the origins, the hepatitis virus is spread to two different species: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D can be transmitted to the virus through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, thyroid secretion or storage).
Travellers are recommended for an vaccine against the viruses A and B, however, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur approximately two or three weeks after the consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Then the yellow look appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair is bright, the urine is dark, and healing can take up to two or three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B-related, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only every 10 infected people are treated with medicinal products.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated it may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the trigger destroys the liver cells at home - in many cases the first symptoms occur after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular control tests, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to seek the home doctor for the first signs of unknown origin.
In due course, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated, thus banning the risk of infection and preventing cancer.
The 30th September is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time of patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research has shown, religious faith as a kind of "surgery" has already been shown to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined how far the belief in God affects the human feeling of pain, the British magazine "Telegraph" reported.
During the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electroshocks while studying a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers could turn off most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it was even proven that Catholics could activate part of their brain, which is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project involving philosophers and theologians from different departments of the University.
In the trial, the samplers were connected to the left hand, which gave the electroshocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate heavily on two paintings: to one image of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo da Vinci "The Lady with Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary among the believers would raise a sort of religious trance, while they chose the image of da Vinci, because it was hardly different from the other painting and was perceived as comforting.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages at that time, while they should see either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" at the sight of God's mother, as if they were "careful", and they had felt "peace and peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of their eyes.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, thought that similar effects could also be caused by other, powerful images also among the atheists, but only the corresponding photo had to be found.
"We should find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases," Wright said.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains as to what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you tell me about yourself.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: it is in the pockets of people as well as over their heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their vacation, which doctors they go to, and what they move.
And that's not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's CEOs.
In the direction of skeptics who are complained about by Orwells Horror Visions, he points out: These would just ignore the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently thought that Google's main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the company's original goal, where they want to "order all the information of this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years Google is still a world-changing job only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status Quo in five years thought Schmidt: he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "What kind of job really suits me?", however, software programs are not yet able to do because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that search terms will be registered during their Internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they have been searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search and to take back on it later, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic the so-called "recommendations" are also based on which the system recommends tailor-made products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data abuse - "When you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google Data Monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company, which gives rise to fear, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire to resist the power that many Internet users have to resist.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also passed on to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
An example of this was recently the treatment against Pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which the Brazilian government's Google provided information collected from the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify Pedophilia.
However, in May, concerned users were able to recall when Google, together with the EFF civil rights organisation, successfully appealed to the FBI: therefore, in the future, Google cannot be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 search terms in relation to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but it has been re-opened for two months by the individual users' list, or their web and search term list.)
So Google's image remains controversial: Those who do not share their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using Google's services give the company a boost to the conservative companies.
In fact, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and excited computer fans, activists and users, agrees with the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason is that Google does not require identification codes for its users, unlike Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be much more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks are looking at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, a relationship that has become the focus of the term "Web 2.0" in recent years.
For "Web 2.0" is nothing but collaboration, say, the users deliberately leave track and use the available communication channels, and even if the amounts are different individually, the main thing remains the same, that is to say, to show themselves to the public.
At the same time, an average youth can manage its profile on several community portals - from Facebook to Xanga, through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are affected by Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: In view of last night's party photos, the friend will soon find out with whom she has enjoyed her unfaithful friend, or the employee will be released because in his blog he only makes too much of his concern about company management - one is sure: the term "private sphere" has now been completely reinterpreted.
He who conducts an online life is what he gives of himself - in this way, for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even deal with the Google monopoly, can enjoy doing this - like with Scroogle, a tool that, although accessing Google's search engine, does not leave any traces.
Not a few people deliberately register on community pages so that they are not found, but also Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphics tools and RSS feeds, can handle alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile of the user.
The public opinion is in no way waiting for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising surfaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the faster and faster services introduced not only provide Microsoft but also other software developers with head breaks.
However, critical observers also find the disturbing counter-police: for example, the Group Management has completely rejected a protest of the employees after the fees of the firm's kindergarten were doubled, and the management felt that the multiple feeding of the employees was too costly. However, this must be all too mild to say that Google even went to the knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed with an agreement that would filter out all the regime-critical hits, or those that opposed the good taste.
The Group's internal rules mean that no new service will be applied in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could shift a little bit further: while some of my, Google's book and magazine scan, or archiving project, now assumes that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the material - for example "Scroogled", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes in a better orwelling way a future in which a person will be very close to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in the elimination of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police now questioned two young people suspected of having helped with the destruction of the tracks, the spokesperson of the Borsod police station told them on Tuesday.
The young people were steadfast, currently being charged with aid.
According to information provided by the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened with a penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was investigated on Sunday.
The man is under an urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people from money.
In the course of the investigations, it was found that the 23-year-old had owed a higher amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to cover up his guilt, so he lured his believer last Wednesday to a site in Ózd where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of a long hand - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapons and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange places a purchase order for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the hundred percent purchase of the shares packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludvik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, however, which wants to sell more than 60% of the paper in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", Poland's bids include the highest purchase price that has been offered for the Prague stock exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not conclude that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to SEK 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 per cent stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ongoing international financial crisis, some leading European pages already spoke on Tuesday from "the second 11 September".
We owe the US President the global financial disaster, for example "La Repubblica" - the President has not even been able to get his own party for the draft legislation behind him to bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-thousand investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
Parts of the press in Madrid are also located in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the brink of collapse.
The U.S. financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and it will cause suffering to the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congress vote, the danger is that Washington has not prepared a political means for crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
You can't leave the threat out of sight anymore, for example, the Geneva "days-announcer".
Although some states could provide their wake-up financial institutions with rescue packages and banks save with the taxpayers' money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are no more banks to argue, then no further financial syringes or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, the EU Member States had to jump over their shadow and centralise control over monetary markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weaker financial institutions, the Vienna "The Standard" remembers. In addition, the newspaper continues, the concerns are becoming more realistic that according to the Americans, European taxpayers now also had to get a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not taken the crisis seriously, which is now like a tsunami across the ancient continents.
Although the "Savers" did not have to "weave" at once with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to determine in which case it would be reasonable to use the taxpayer's money to avert even greater damage.
Smart car imitates the flight of the sky
What would be the best method for developing new technologies for accident prevention if not imitating the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan presented an amazing project in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired by the creation of new accident prevention systems.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C-controlled biomimetic system, a mini car, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield", said Kazuhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The compounded eye of the bee, which can be seen in each direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the compounded eye, the researchers intervene on the idea of laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in second break parts, and the author immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place instinctively.
"If it wasn't so, the autobot couldn't react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the autobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, since this technology corresponds to the inner and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer, within the accidents, is still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And this must go on for a second.
However, the deviation, unlike the bees, can not be up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the elasticity of the tires.
While the bees here are endlessly open to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the movement of rotation, or acceleration and brake.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process and react to some inputs per second.
It does not need to store it, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction based on previous maneuvers, so that it is currently only using a handful KB memory.
There's no need for gigabytes and megabytes of heavy memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which will be in production series within the next ten years, according to Nissan's estimate.
Another application could be found in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately driving the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to his goal.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is the written version of the 700-billion-dollar heavy rescue package law that will be applied in several stages and aimed at the purchase of the bad loans of banks.
In the first step, half of the money will be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday afternoon after the local time of the East Coast, after several days of debate, the congressmen reached an agreement on the 700-billion-dollar heavy rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the American House of Representatives, and thought that the agreement should only be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package was supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Financial Minister Henry Paulson said that the programme will be effective and efficient, but it will have to do even more. Pelosi said it was not about saving Wall Street, but about the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Washington Time Sunday afternoon at 8 a.m. (Central European Time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high flight on the stock exchange.
On Monday, the House of Representatives agreed first on the draft legislation for the stabilization of the economy in 2008, then the Senate is in line.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
The programme, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, whereby the $700 billion should be spent once for the purchase of fouler, with credit-filled securities.
In a first tranche, the maximum is to be spent half of the 700 billion amount, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum is to be used for the purchase of low-credited, bad securities and the remaining 100 billion USD is to be decided by the President.
The programme is reviewed by a Commission of its own, which is also the president of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
Within the meaning of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgaged securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can take place both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the care-giving funds and the companies pay the fees due for the damage to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be provided as immediate aid for the American financial system, whether for the large purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks involved in difficulties and now state aid can expect their disposals, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas hose, to be cut off by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance assists each other.
The reduction basically means that if the ministry buys in an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the beneficiary bank manager is transferred to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the fake credit, the government will aggressively turn on to ensure that the managers are not overrun.
The picture also shows that the existing Gold Handshake Treaties are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements so that more people can participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in managerial fees are regulated by law, democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains participation rights in participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the bank saved is restored.
The bill provides that the President will have to submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years as to how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money at all, says Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise

Domestic sales prices are only slightly lower compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Also, the sales prices of the processing industry have risen only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily in bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, and in shoes prices were 2.5 percent high.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and productions (1.6 percent).
A price decrease was recorded for crude oil processing (1.4 percent), for electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and for wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices remained unchanged in paper production, as well as in warehouses and printing works.
In other branches of the processing industry a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the important domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the price increase in gas introduced on 1 July.
If the domestic markets of the processing industry are considered annually, prices of crude oil processing have increased most (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in food production, beverages and tobacco was 11 percent.
A price drop was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical devices (0.3 percent).
The value of the other processing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Total prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent last year.

The biggest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8%) compared to the period of comparison in 2007.
In the consumer goods sectors a price increase of 6.8 per cent was observed, with a price reduction of 1.4 per cent for investment goods.
Industry's export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent in the year.
The domestic currency became 1.7 per cent weaker compared to the euro, 7.1 per cent weaker, and compared to the exchange rate of August 2007, it became 7.5 per cent higher compared to the euro, even 15.9 per cent higher than the dollar.
No more visas in the USA since 2009?
Kinga Göncz looks forward to the entry into force of the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement by 12 January, as stated by the Foreign Minister before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In your view, "it all depends now only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced into the overseas world in a timely manner."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists had to register in advance.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington today.
She meets with Foreign Minister Condolezza Rice, who will transmit the "Middle Merit Cross with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and also conduct discussions with the foreign policy advisors of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the $700 billion bank bailout package. However, there are also politicians who call for the Minister of Finance's resignation.
The Congress and representatives of the government announced on Sunday that they had reached an agreement on the bank rescue package after a few days of marathon consultations.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the emergence of the frozen credit market, have become the main issues of the Presidency's campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claimed to be better suited than the opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic themes, while McCains Hoch, who provided him with the presentation of Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was also melted.
At an election event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly adopt the law on the 700 billion dollar heavy package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he supported.
"We must act now, but responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industrial sectors, and the stability of the entire economy are being threatened," he said before 35,000 observers.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "absolute".
In an interview given by the broadcaster ABC, McCain stated: "We will all have a hard time buying (...) but not an hour is definitely no alternative".
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the disposals for the top manager - something he had been on.
To the CBS, Obama said that McCain would not have played a definitive role in the negotiations, but he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokesman for the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, the only voters within the camp became more self-conscious - "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (e.g. mirror.de)
In the online edition of the left-based German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for CSU's dramatic downfall in his article "Bayern's Revolution Destroys Their Fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein Huber-Duo took over his office.
The Christosocials have renewed Bavarian over decades - now the modern citizens turn away from them.
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come, but on Sunday something came to an end, which was already quite accurate ten years ago: the unmistakable hegemony of a state party
Because already ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and has fallen under the 50% mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, i.e. in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization operated by the CSU in the Federal Republic has ultimately ruined its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but it was significant at the rate. However, without impact, the secularization, the success of education, the conversion of East and North Germans to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain faithful to the CSU electors.
Modernization always goes hand in hand with an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-willed.
It is noteworthy that in the last few weeks, the classic citizens' groups had the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the professional citizenship and voters with Abitur as a university degree.
Here CSU's support fell to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper reports in its "Who With Whom? Party leaders holding back on coalition issues" articles on the chaotic domestic situation in Austria after the elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the EPP.
The EPP prohibits the integration of the SPOs into internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussion in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now they are all about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders have hardly been able to look at their cards.
SpÖ-Chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the EPO.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very likely - in some countries and in the social partnership is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the EVP as deputy Chancellor, opened Faymann.
As he said, the voters had chosen the Schüssel-Malterer course.
A repetition of this direction is not at issue.
Manyer have responded cautiously to red offers.
Cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tried to insummate himself in the internal affairs of the EVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or goes into the coalition, be fully open now, and these questions should be discussed within the EVP.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider appeared in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are willing to take over government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The devil's circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit in Paris has begun on equal opportunities, which is being set up today by the EU Presidency of France.
In her speech addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party, particularly the Education Segregation, drew attention to the fact that this is one of the most serious violations of the law that the Roma children are facing, and that is also the greatest obstacle to their need to apply.
The high-level conference was opened by French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the MEPs of Fidesz reported, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, the Roma would be forced out of the labour market primarily because of their low levels of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths have no secondary education, and due to poor primary education only a small part of them can reach a university degree".
In addition, Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human right, a key part of the realization of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
It is important, in the view of the honourable Members, that this relationship be made aware of the widest possible circle - that is, Rome and non-Roma.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts school, the more his chances are to become a productive member of the labour market; and through income tax and income tax, they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high quality education - bad and segregated education - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the desegregation process in the education sector, and it is essential to comply with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We need to break the devilish circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen," Járóka asked.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit will be held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the promotion of the objectives of equality of opportunity and freedom of discrimination at European but also at national level, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Mercy on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the electoral cycle, there were no heads at once, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace will last.
On the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of voice will be decided last October at the extraordinary party day.
However, the highly trained duo has already shown that it does not want to stick to its seats.
This is why they want to have the angry group and the party base, which one day after the "Bayeric tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Five years ago – admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career level – the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent. However, one year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of the votes could be secured.
The CSU was a 46-year-old "alleingrier" in Bavaria, which generated 18 percent of German GDP.
The Conservatives remain the determining force in the also important southern federal country for the Hungarian economy, but in the future they will have to rule in a coalition.
As the first sign of internal restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the research team, which will lead the liberal FDP, or the law-enforced "Free voters", to investigate a possible Munich Coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list of "Free voters" those Gabriele Pauli enter the legislator, whose anti-stoiers appeared the Huber-Beckstein Duo first took advantage of to look out for the target politician without pleasure.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilization of Becksteins.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far taken the threads from the background, will play an active role. On 28 September, the former Prime Minister and CSU president called the "Bitter Day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards CDU - in his view the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed much to the success of 2005 at national level, is not reintroduced with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot again become a chancellor after the elections in September 2009.
Markel, who did not heal from her disappointment over the failure, believes that the land loss of the CSU will not have a negative effect on the large coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative: the injured CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats goes on.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bayern since 1946.
Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0
The elections on Sunday did not create an opposition MP in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this lies at the level of prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD is suspected of illegality in counting the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the 10 million-inhabited state has been without opposition for decades, the opposition party, which has been called the United Democratic Forces (ODS), has been sincerely hoping that Lukaschenko, who would "let some members of the opposition in Parliament" for the fourth time during the unholy elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006 will have renewed his presidency's mandate.
For this reason, the ODS has even distanced itself from the boyscotts previously planned.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly dependent on Russia's increasing prices for natural gas imports. In order to reduce price increases, even loans were made, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading pipeline, to the Russians. Thus, in the light of opposition expectations, Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-ranking politicians because of the EU's anti-democratic political system.
For temporary relaxation, the OECD's evaluation report focused on positive movements rather than on shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's speed report criticised the campaign already on Monday - so oppositions should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition should not be present when counting the votes.
Nevertheless, the opposition can recognise an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been placed on a free footing, and Minsk is even ready to face smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the aberrant Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Ukraine has formed a federal state on paper, has seen both areas as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkewitsch told us.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to continue, even though "the powerful have been afraid to leave only one opposition to Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for an economic reform.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers need to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of the sale of stones, but still I see that more and more people are supporting change, even older ones," said Milinkewitsch on the assumption that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agree with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" that starts to break at the silence of a cemetery," said Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, said the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in acts, not words." The lack of opposition was therefore evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entry and exits of the officials.
From now on, the measure will come into force against those plumbers who first stamp and then go for coffee drinks during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Turnable doors are a means of increasing efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism", points out Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General said: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
So everything in everything now there is no breakfast during working hours; close with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas spoke about this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the General Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Administrazione)
from Rome, the minister announces that "the absence of officials has reduced to 50% within three months, which means 60,000 people per year are more present at work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of public administration of Italy
"their wage dynamics - as the minister says - have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate in the last 8-10 years."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to counter the Brunetta Decree in the context of the call supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers of lower absences in the work - as the consumer center writes - the people of the 'active faulpelze' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together to declare war the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; the planned extension of the compulsory household allowance of the sick worker is also called for, during which checks can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day there are 2500 accidents at work in Italy, three people die and 27 live with disabilities.
For 2007, data from the Inaiil (Instituto nazionale contra gli infortuni sul trabajo) confirmed that the fatal accidents were about 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that almost twice causes as many deaths as were caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will be held in all provinces of Italy on the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his statement to the President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del labor) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, to the protection of the injured workers, to aid the families of the victims and to raise public awareness".
"An emotional "Basta" has risen up to this; of course, in tragedies that, as measured by their size order, trigger some dizzinesss in the media and public participation. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even happen in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is at least a resource problem: there must be a crucial investment in education and information."
Many initiatives are of particular importance for a more direct awareness in school framework by young people who are feeding on the world of work.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to detract from its social seriousness. We need to put into effect and improve a legislative standard.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "how the phenomenon of labour-related deaths is an urgent social emergency that affects the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on certain rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data of accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not mean that the number of accidents at work is too high," says President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you think you're basically doing too little to cope with the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight it through various actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are, in our view, necessary – says Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting school."
"An additional effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is asked about a phenomenon that is a social emergency."
Mercandelli also called for "the progressive deterioration of protection for workers' accidents" and called for the "removal of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to give the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations that are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player in charge: Danger of hearing damage
Sound music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission reports on the EU's view of csseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) in a report published in Brussels today.
"From the report, as it says in a remark, it will be clear that 5-10% of those who spend at least five years a week listening to music with portable music devices, risking the permanent loss of their hearing for at least an hour per day."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who normally wear musical instruments and phones, put their ears on a high volume without knowing it irreparably damage," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – so called by the self – there is a clear risk that it is too fast to act.
What really counts is to sensitize the consumer and make this information community.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems in order to be fully effective and to take steps with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music instruments among young people.
"Scientists - thus the EU Communication concludes - confirm that there is too much concern and that the EU Commission will, together with the other members of the EU and those concerned, examine the necessary measures now to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the sound level of portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could result from a major noise load.
These damage can be very limited, in which solutions such as reducing the volume and length of noise exposure can be achieved.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the Eu points out that if users of portable music devices only hear music for five hours a week (over 89 decibels) so that the legal limits are already exceeded, which applies to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
So this is 5-10 % of users of such devices whose number can be estimated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Alemano gives the launch of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We begin today, in March it will be over, in June it will be taken into account.
This is the course set out by the chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". This morning the Commission met in a new seat behind the Caracalla terms.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and municipality will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor of Gianni Alemano in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Alemano. "It will put forward proposals for a development plan for Rome, which will remain the political responsibility of the city and the municipality.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities to have only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will relaunch itself, as such a project must have a temporary end point.
In June, as the mayor announces, we will present the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence because of their lack of commitment, Germany refers to: "All depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is too often concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the other hand, we want to have a longer period of time in mind so that we can work with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The Mayor of Rome places great importance on stating, "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens any cent and it will bring us to mind. It will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemano, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan which is neither hermetical nor static to enable a quality leap - which it really needs - in order to take a joint step towards the future."
A future, says the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the present municipal boundaries but will look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who has a lot to think of as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will become the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations with the found Islam (and still does this as a private man)".
The attacks on Obama are becoming more and more intense, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet site: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very angry: he thinks he will be given the highest office of a nation who has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
However, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a great lead.
In this case too, people are there who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the polling room will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until the end.
"Say what you want, then we'll decide who we're going to make our cracks for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: If Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – just now, where the success of the black candidate seems so secure.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error did Bush have during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a step in the back.
In Iraq 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
He who takes his position is in a great task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murder" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they explained that they were not really concerned about the general credibility of the information relating to the competent authorities.
You don't feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts in the newsroom, that is, the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism is being fulfilled today by the American journalist.
Six of the ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism is at national level on the wrong path.
In the local area it is even 65% for executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in what direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups are on their way to the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they want to join the new technology, hoping that "they will bring something good for journalism".
The biggest riss is in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the chief editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% are at local level.
Some think it has to do with the "safety at work".
The operators who fear losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
Journalists have 30%.
The theme of "safer work" in the team (our editors, etc. Red.) is always a current theme in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, such as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The editors are very often paid very high, and the editor can only occasionally receive EUR 10000 per month, including pension and insurance money.
As for the holiday, the thing is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, as well as so many after the third, to finally reach a certain number of years of 15 holidays.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often be "sick" over the course of the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: JUSTICE IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA LIMITED IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is identified for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was turned into a duty of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate broker to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the Court of Justice, the same proceedings (against which the public prosecutor had appealed) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence against him.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already become apparent a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the 700 billion-dollar package of the White House: a large part of the Americans were and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the bitter issue of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the run-up to the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast souls, has always benefited the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are hostile to the "those in Washington" and the financial world and, in particular, win in the south and the centre of the electorate states.
This part of the party thanks its rise to the vote I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned is not only a small part of the major changes announced or even represented by the current economic earthquake: not only in the US, but also in the whole of the West, and perhaps beyond, they will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-awaited events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these is the rediscovery, the unheard of renaissance of the state in connection with some kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links to abroad and at the same time manage an unfavourable amount of private resources living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments: how to behave towards the families concerned, which are also a huge electoral mass.
So the crisis appears economically global, politically against it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems thus to have turned aside and lost its right to speak: the EU has provided an enlightening proof of this, which, due to its second division in various national and international conflicts, does not find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now counts with the intervention of his own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, in particular, distribution of funds: Since the crisis has become more serious, only the United States in the economic situation can save themselves without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: two conditions, under certain circumstances, are therefore not to be overestimated, on which, otherwise, no international organisation or market will be able to recover in a similar manner.
This new emphasis, which is placed on the state-national element, is still perfectly in line with the increasing importance that is recently being attached in the economy to a more closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxic way is right now, when we were so convinced that we would have been in a networked whole for a long time, in a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of intangibles, that we have to determine at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can all be transported from one place to the other in the world, they are still highly linked to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the person who owns such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a land free of waste, without water or oil.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief introduction.
Whoever's a territory, who's a government, who's a politician, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to handle things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of tension about the existing leaders, among other things those of the economy that have dropped out as insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper richer and more disturbing aspect in some sense: a loss of confidence, an innocence, a picture of inadvertentness, a sense of distance that is all directed towards a whole class of managers in the western countries.
It seems thus that the belief among many of the population seems to be the way of not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as ever more and more foreign.
The demand for leadership is thus fuelled by a fluctuated but powerful movement of the demise of the leading class and of the usual political establishment. This is reflected in the unforeseeable "resolved" of voters and in the unmistakable conversion of the collective mood of the last time: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of the US MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights in Italy also plays a role here).
You get the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, magazines, intellectual creditors, some of them would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value for what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is even strengthened by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would be simply an exaggeration to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes wide open is not safe.
The superclip that allows you to move up walls
The forces of gravity can be overcome by a adhesive and can climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached the goal.
With a sticker on a surface of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – which has an American magazine – has published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material produced by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be seen as a series of pipes arranged by a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic resins that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and slide paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the ability to keep the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "remove easily from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Like how to push Spiderman on walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also leaders of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the area of space travel.
So for the moment the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER WAY OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new kind of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a microfibre adhesive that, like hair, cleanses itself from dust by moving on a surface itself and thus maintains a perfect liability.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription
Caution against grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin richness in the summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken simultaneously with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on their absorption by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed to the risk of packaging as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with drug intake. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again sounded a warning: There is enough glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines to the extent that they are practically eliminated and the health of patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmetics, cardiovasculars, anxiolytics and neurologicals to toxic levels.
GEFAHR – the same Agency for Medicinal Products had warned physicians and patients two years ago of the risks of this combination and stressed that caution should be exercised in conjunction with medicines such as Diazepan or methadone.
ES NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that may inhibit the medicinal products.
The list of active substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal by Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there is still uncertainty about not having a doctor or a pharmacist to ask," the expert of the Ansa Agency said.
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is at the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular article for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of Enron’s collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times leadership that this second event was more crucial to US history than the assassinations.
A forecast that did not receive little controversy in response and that the economist was kept up years later, but today it is quite right.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals has disappeared as part of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom from the public field of view," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economy of great value", but also a "very aggressive style" banalist who is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under freelance and public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the public with some news: in addition to a revised and now Spartan-designed start menu, a complete compatibility with Apple's Mac OS X operating system is finally achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against it was also compatible with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which, for example, makes it easier to send via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files in graphics editing modules and at the same time to preserve the original layout of the page.
Thus, it is also possible to generate "hybrid" PDF files that extend the typical graphics of Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by multiple users, thereby avoiding conflicts in the case of changes; in the case of the text processing system, a request will be granted to each processor in order to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish different OpenOffice functions on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result will be made public.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.1.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
While freedom of charge can be an incentive for the spread of the program in private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed the big throw: finally, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word-compatible text production program; Calc, the table program aimed at pushing Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the known access; and lastly, Draw, a graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand already achieved.
Coal also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens to me as part of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-class player and winner of the best climber's shirt.
The message published the L'Equipe daily newspaper on its website.
The 26-year-old coal from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested positive for Cera, the third generation's epoch. This was already the case with the Italians Ricardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses of the blood samples of coal are among those made in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-tests confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrians will lose their third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission Pierre Border confirmed the positive Epotest, and also informed the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian went behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the best climber's shirt for himself.
COVER SUBJECT: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALIAN RACIAL?
Italy, "the single country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only being taken up with opposition.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted to the whole topic of racism in Italy, and comes from the case of young, Burkina Faso-based Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he had stolen a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times refers to as "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration feelings and the greatest support of the League of the North are to be recorded".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times draws attention to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster designation of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underlines the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State in combating racism."
Student victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students does not know crises.
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the tenant shop, a single room can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious steps. In fact, quite a number of students are losing their right to study because their families are not able to support them at this level" – according to Sunia's director Laura Mariani – "in these cities the great demand from the students leads to a distortion of the market that has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rent limit, unallowed rentals.
For the Sunia there is the need for exceptional measures leading to a revision of the tax at lower rental prices.
For more detailed consideration of the survey, it appears that in Milan a sleeping place is needed in the Brianza district about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, an average sleeping space costs 350/400 Euro, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the districts around the university, there are 250/280 Euros for a bed of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bedroom.
Only a little deeper are the rentals in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euro in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who live abroad can save money: 300 Euros for a bedroom and 450 Euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bedroom costs 250-350 Euro, a single room of at least 350.
In the smallest cities the prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% above average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old Kino Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinemas
The historical cinemas are closed because of the favorable multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city like a face without eyes."
This image by Director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of eradicating the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-story complexes in the periphery, in the long term means death for the single-story cinema in the centre. A process that not only appears irrevocable and irrevocable but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
Mostly affected are historical sites full of memories, "it's like losing a friend, with whom you've put back a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "New Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oscar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It's about the history of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably forever lost cinema.
The figures supplied by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the extraordinary number of 316 traditional cinemas has to be closed; these signs paid mostly the cinemas in large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main culprits are the multiplexkinos, because they are these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years the Lombardy lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has evolved in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all, the preservation of the existing, because a hall in the city closes, not all of his tribal customers are willing to search for a multiplex cinema instead of the old one in the periphery.
And here the missing state for the business association fund is out of the question: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not comply with existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million would be needed in the year".
It is interesting to see the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, who, because of the fear of the old cinemas, has decided to protect it through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged also include tax advantages for cinema operators and benefits for the public in relation to road transport: it will be allowed to drive in the traffic restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a happy initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
But of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to fix something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of Baghiera's "supercinema", the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to establish the "New Cinema Paradise", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I've been living in Rome; when I cross the Rialto or Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to avoid having to see the dusted poster.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta' lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The prosecutions of the Antimafia Authority of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for processing in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, was also taken into custody: the lawyer, who bears the same names as the clan's boss, had already been sentenced to 10 million euros for the development of criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advisory activities."
"So the Mafia group was made possible – the judges – to enter the Council Houses on an official basis and to adopt public administration policies."
The chairman of the Agazio Loiero Regional Committee of Calabria does not deny that in his region, "all is except an exception to encounter links between local authorities and organised crime."There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others, in which such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white West."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the police of the Pirolli clan said they had been kidnapped.
Since the end of last April, the municipality of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved, but in 1991 – and also because of the apparent links between organised crime and local administration – the local politicians of its municipalities have been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Central Right Coalition after the election of May 2006.
He called scandal when the prefecture arranged for the dissolution of the municipality.
He was interested in this with Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, whom he visited to invent everything for political-strategic reasons. However, in connection with the arrest order this morning, the judges stated that the Pyromalli-Clan had even dared to apply for an amendment to the A3 project.
From an investigation into the case of Dal Torrione, the willingness to oppose the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli, has shown itself to be the same as the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes from the waves, all of a sudden the big ones run on
It is a non-successful source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seems to understand the great energy companies of the world.
Waves, currents and currents are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is looking at now, and also looking to occupy, like giants like Chevron.
The potential to gain energy from the movements of the sea has been taken into consideration for 70 years; these studies have not been significantly intensified by chance since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil in 1980 broke down the idea of marine energy, but now the environmental organizations and the rising oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This is equivalent to the double of the current energy produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and seasons are coming.
Giants in the attack.
The first company that now puts on the sea energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 for the establishment of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy sector that are putting on the marine energy recovery.
"Chevron is investigating these technologies," says the spokesperson of a company known to the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal, and is reluctant to cooperate with us."
This is about obtaining the approval of the US Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project ahead of the Alaska coast.
This is a not underestimated sign, for example when it is thought that oil is still being fueled by the United States in Alaska and President Bush recently just launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are also unknown, but observers speak of an increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology still in progress, not least since the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small size and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, technologies with far greater environmental impact are needed.
There are various options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected bojen.
The push of the waves, which move up and down the boges, is turned into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer over flasks and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which is operating a generator again.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are still waiting only for state approval, and some of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a grocery store and parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the times are driving the turbines that feed the generator through the rotating movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential customers are already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
Just the waves, then the weather.
According to the Institute for Power Recovery, a particular interest is currently worth the potential that lies in the times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely the modern energy that led to investments in the US, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, which already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are planned for 2009.
