What's up? The ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or pastry
The new councils of the ČSSD in the capital will seem to have to overcome the obvious linguistic barriers so that the members of the Board of Prague and the Municipal Council understand their renewed companions of the ODS.
The period Aktuálně.cz "examined" the members of the new Council of the ČSSD to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in the Council in recent years when the current members of the coalition were ruling in Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's flower and political birth during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Well, includes some of the most known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proved that the new councils do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I'm rather an innovation in Prague's politics," said Lukáš Kaucký, the councillor for culture during the "college" terminology examination.
And with regard to the political veteran, he reacted equally to Karel Březina.
Maybe they know the concept of "goof golf."
"Maybe it's the only expression of everyone you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, usually in slang employment."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published in Aktuálně.cz last June before the ODS voting Congress, the drafting chose six examples, in particular those specifically related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry", "thorn nut", "capital betrayal" and "blindar".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a room, Antonín Weinert, who in future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not take the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolinek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't put myself in these things, nor do I think about how the democrats enjoy themselves."
"What I do care is how we understand ourselves in the implementation of our programmes," he said.
As you have seen, the councillor Lukaš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of the high priest Well, Roman Janoušek.
Kaucky's word "Voldemort" doesn't say anything; the only term he found in the exam is "the largest golf course in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, who immediately adds, "but I know better about the news."
"I'm going to have to point at a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not only recognized in the golf course the Blanka tunnel, but also the environmental councillor Lukaš Plachý.
Then, both socio-democratics know who Voldemort really is and Lukaš Plachý even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague," he soon revealed to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge got them from the news, but does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-democratics.
"I asked my comrades, but it really doesn't seem like we have anything like this."
"Well, among us we use apes, sometimes abbreviations or make word games with names," says the president of the ČSSD Prague, Petr Hulinský, whose partymates call Hulda.
"In college they called me Bríza, but I don't know if my companions call me that too," confesses his own apothecary Karel Brězina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and function.
For his partymates, Weinert is Déda (like "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the fraudulent elections during the party's sponsorship, receives the apode of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his companions.
The apodos are also the only expressions that socio-democratics tolerate in the speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to call him Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz even discovered other clues for this Prague president.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Frogs" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of witches, as published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They often have an advanced age, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
Women who are "voluntarily" witches are sent to an isolated area so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer such a sign."
"Neither does it isolate healthy young women, because they help in work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso is occupied with a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information booklet that should help to prevent witch hunt.
However, this has a stick.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso don't know how to read," warns Die Standard newspaper on the disadvantages of writing sensitization.
Magical charges are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, last week Amy Hemmah died, 72 years old, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gas and burned her.
News appeared on BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to its version, the woman was caught on the oil used for ritual weddings.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to "evict the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of the "witches" supports people of all educational levels.
Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Human soul devourers have always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is trying to calm down the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a wide hunt of witches who allegedly had been related to his death and had tried to kill his own president through black magic."
"To help you bring calls from nearby Guinea that, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, led to force for men and women randomly chosen among the Gambian people to own the president in Kanilai," says the International Amnesty Organization in its report.
In the area, the arrested people had to drink a handful of herbs with aluminogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the prisoners did not survive the stay in the mine.
After the international pressure, about a thousand detainees were finally released.
Bakala rental: it is heated with coal stoves and sign a higher rental
The man, aged and retired, crossed the doors of the care center to the customer of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon magnet" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of floors for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his, his daughter and his son, who are executing the sentence.
The three of them have just taken up the liberalization of the rentals.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay 4,100 crowns from next year for a two-room floor with second-class separate kitchen.
"In addition, it has no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," he shows with his finger the man in his son's new contract, on which he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he said, half-inflicted, half-inflicted.
The BytyOKD.cz civil association, which described the new conditions of rental as "inaccurate and inconvenient", recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when it will publish a guide informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But before this, man makes only one adéman.
"Everybody says something," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory for tests of liberalization.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated lease.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mine waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Just next to the doors are security guards and next to them a machine to pick up number.
"Rent 2011", can be read on a light button from your touch screen.
When you press it, you get out of the machine a paper with a number.
Almost doesn't give time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly thereafter, an older marriage arrives to ask, but the majority of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava in the pockets of the tenants of most 44,000 floors belonging to the RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers you an increase in rent between 15 and 38% in the cards.
A special window is opened on 18 November in the customer centre for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's beginning," they reply, after a short doubt, the workers who are in it when the customer presents themselves as a journalist.
Liberalization and the former Bakala miner floors are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Prior to the elections, they have been treated highly and clearly by the Vice-President of Parliament, originating in Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, ČSSD, and are now constantly appearing in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor."
"I didn't change the damn dish of the bathroom," the man mentioned in the introduction says.
According to the workers, for the time being, more than nothing retired to check if they receive a discount on the rental if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half of the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of the "liberalization" mine is certainly not able to dissipate the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only asked for the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people," she said.
In the meantime, RPG proposes to hold individual meetings on contracts on the web and in its tables where necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, an independent judge shall resolve the matter.
"It's not a threat, it's information about the only way to proceed and fully in accordance with the law," cautions RPG on its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man who's on the street in front of the customer's attention center gives him at least in part the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I do not have the means to go to the courts," he said.
But immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you in the media that they don't sign, so maybe people are waiting," he said.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic need.
"The current rentals still do not cover even the necessary amounts for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty's residential portfolio, which adds that the carefree state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments of 4 billion, the figure will increase to 5,200 million in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large screen hanging from the roof, facing the sittings of the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
"The increase in rental in 2011 is 15% and less applicable to 31200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, there will always be a maximum of 7.50 monthly check crowns per square metre," is indicated on the screen.
Only an increase of 38% is the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low quantities of 19.66 crowns per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not impact rents by hitting, but will be scaled between four and eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money of the rental lift (see chart) back on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rental promotion agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need custody
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides inside a small garden with all of his own facilities: color walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can visit her.
Arch.Design, from which many famous buildings of Brno emerged, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mining.
About 90 people work in the company, mainly at the age of baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the yard is one of the benefits Arch offers.Design your workers in the context of your social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
Mining was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's retail business is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (over 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-care facility in operation with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the funding application.
Children's attention is in the hands of qualified staff; a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education are also present all day. The care is now home to children with no age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since this is a "miniguardery", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children at the same time, although with shifts it is more during the day.
The operation of the guard is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the guard, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is individual education and care, the content of the retail programme is comparable to that of the regular pre-school education programme.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of late collecting children from college when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
Arch.Design is thus located among companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program has strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric pond, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Batlló House, Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its similar form to a skeleton, the locals seized it "the house of the bones".
Its organic forms, its attractive colors, the innovative use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds the scales and all-present gently curved lines, all of which is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The cover of the house plays with onyric lines, delicate colors and textures extracted from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought order are observed.
At night, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is lit so that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the twisting of the forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The waving wood copies the frames of the windows, the rocks, the decorations of the doors, the mirrors and the letters.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district in number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gràcia, emerged from the remodeling of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Joseph Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting at zero, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, made up of several apartments, did not design it by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their plans for the project there were ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in Casa Batlló's proposals was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Mila and the Güell de Gaudí Park, where other parts of it are located.
Because of its organic form, the premises soon after its completion caught it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it the "house of drawers".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique system in the house for the central heating age with ventilation breathers and typical fireplaces.
It may seem strange to have a tilt of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not comply at all with the construction rules of the moment and did not allow themselves to be influenced by them.
Still, the construction was granted the corresponding permit from the beginning, although the data indicated in it on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, at its completion, the municipality was so affected by the result that it requested correction.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public wheel.
The arrangements never took place, on the contrary: only 15 days after the council's request, Joseph Batlló requested permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed on the lower floors.
On the second floor gallery there was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all right angles and lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked on the modern concept of connection of space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and a larger group can be communicated in this way without problems, without giving up the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white tiles and blues covering the inner courtyard and tragalluces.
The game with the two colors provides the maximum light on all the floors of the house.
It was simply based on the beginning that the white reflects more light than the dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the rays of the sun.
Anyone can visit the House Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it was a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and to the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The entrance price to the monument is not insignificant, reaching EUR 16.50, although students, retirees and card holders get 20% discount.
The amount exceeds significantly the entry price of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lagoon towers, you should quickly become a friend of any resident of the nearby houses and visit it at home.
How to choose the mattress and the somier: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pumping frame for the bed; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface to fall down, that is, the mattress and the sommer.
First of all, they must be complemented by perfection in order to adapt to specific users.
During the election many elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and gender of the owner.
It is also important to have the type of interior where the mattress and sommer are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" more slowly.
In addition, they tend to suffer considerably more than the usual polyurethane shells.
Therefore, it is necessary to return them more frequently.
If the central channels do not flow properly and, above, they are on a solid basis, they remain within the humidity. Even mojo can appear below.
When choosing a bed, they also influence customs.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems feeling well on a lower and hard surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep well here."
"For their shoulders, heels and chairs, they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastics."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, so they get misinformation from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamkiková, who specializes in the furnished furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, spend time preferring viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore to appreciate viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimize your rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapt to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it won't turn like after a hard game.
Just get better sleep.
Viscoelastics also acts as a protection against the lakes.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when you knock your mouth up, you should have your hands gently tied to your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu chaluníkó to decoratoró, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics for many years, which he teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you need to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to fit the dreams at different heights, which is not always possible on all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with a spring inside a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softness.
"By touching it with your hand or by staying in the mattress, you should certainly not notice the mollusks," warned Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of somier.
The bedrooms that are completely covered, where the mattress and base are like siamese, do not make sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and cannot be washed, which is often done today.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that in about five or seven years the mattress will start to remind us of a large (and congested) tamiz.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that speak of a life of the mattress up to 25 years old or, even, of a life insurance.
However, everything has a pen.
Therefore, sellers give advice: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of cleaning and washing the floor, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattresses are currently made with cremation closures throughout their perimeter, so when opening them they remain in two parts (very important for washing and washing size!), their handling in the larger models (and by one person) when raising the mattress may seem to be a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a dreamer, does he have a firm table?
Never!
Like a lot for the beds thought to spend one night visiting.
However, you should make (if you don't already have them) ventilating orifices on the table and be used with a spring cushion inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with spring springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane resins should not be used on such bases.
For non-articular blades containing between 14 and 18 blades, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fibre) may be used, although it is always better to have a sommer with a larger number of blades, 28 or more, where the blades in the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be controlled.
Knitting blades should not be used with a spring cushion, since they do not react to the tilting.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the blades that allows you to press or even bend the blades so that they "round" perfectly on your shoulders during your sleep.
For men who have very broad shoulders, this is something very important.
Even they are remembered by the insect manufacturers who, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around their shoulders.
Women are also remembered, for which they place a softer area around their seats.
For the most demanding customers, there are dreams with structure in cross or table with the so-called multitortion amortization.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
It should also be borne in mind that, although it uses the right mattress and somier, if it uses a bad pillow (large and "female"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles can relax.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
At the tip of the side, the pillow must be at the same level (when combined with the somier with shoulder strength or the softest area of the mattress) as the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to see, it seems, with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, organic mattresses are fashionable.
Petroleum-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as resin or soya.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers use soya.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of natural materials," explains Petr Vasiček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the seedlings, one of the first vera aloe.
But you can also choose from the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "fresh" with bristle plant extracts, so that the bottom of the mattress absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the bottom.
The red pepper extract improves the circulation of blood, so that women feel warmer.
Your favorites now?
Cold foam mattresses, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, make them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities allows for the manufacture of mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels goes.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT rate, since they are considered health-care facilities.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and dreams.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a foam with memory memory attached to the background by 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The age of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Originally it emerged as a material for NASA, because during the dark astronaut discharges they were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur melts with heat and hardens with the cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid the production of lakes, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use the foam Eucaterm C or Twinsaver and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
The fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, originally designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, to the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a bead box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička case and began to inform about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the expense of invading their privacy.
"We are all trying to say that this is not a spy, but another way to reduce the possibility of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of monitoring devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that, in certain cases, you can abuse such devices, for example if you get into someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we haven't met with such cases yet."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," added Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočová warns of the fact that if the child does not want to take it, he will just take it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when they deliberately lose certain things if they want to avoid controlling them."
"Before, the parents had enormous confidence in the mobiles, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," Bocková says.
In your opinion, it is questionable if such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check if the child carries any type of electronic device that can reveal its location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the tracking devices are being extended, they will also be searched for, as their sale will undoubtedly be carried out with great publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, add that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and persons, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can serve as a help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If it is damaged, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most expensive devices are integrated into a tilting meter, so if the person simply repatriates and becomes immobilized, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," Čech says.
In your opinion, a service of this kind can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which only a special software must be installed.
The problem with the current tracking units is that they are currently devices with a size similar to a belt box or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Macro Weil Pilin, for this reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, you will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
"Or identify him after a certain time, which can make the police earn time," he adds.
Although the tracking devices are carried on the dome or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is about checking the position with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mixes to surround all the Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of mecha to capture explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the mecha is from two years, four to the maximum.
The army bought the mix for explosives to the STV Group, a.k.a. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNA by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha, saying that soldiers need mecha 60 kilometres per year for training maneuvers.
According to the military pyrotechnic calculations, with which MF DNAs were contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also by all generals, senior officials, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They didn't want any exemptions either from the Minister of Defence Alexander Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Pick army.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spends 60 kilometers of michae.
Such a length equals 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two metres in diameter, the army would have with the new purchase (including adding the consumption of the engineering or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally to Minister Vondra a short time ago because they said they only had ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices by money issue are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of inner clothing.
"I also can't understand that they repeatedly buy us such amounts of mecha."
"But it is your decision and, no doubt, they will know why they act like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits STV Group's commercial director Jan Děcký.
The spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends hundreds of kilometres of mecha, also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Décký, from STV Group, points out that the mosque has only a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, of two years.
"If it is stored under perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, by the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give its name.
After the end of their useful lives, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometres of mecha, he obtained a discount.
"We were costing 60% less than last year's request of 244 kilometers," says spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's purchasing center.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of mike by police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the ammunition of World War II or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police are always only asking for the fair amount of ammunition to be exhausted before their useful lives are finished.
They decided it for safety reasons for the pyrotechnics and, moreover, as long as more modern and reliable types of mix can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition at the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the two hundred thousand-person Czechoslovakian army was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics MF DNA spoke to, after a few years the following problem will occur with the current: hundreds of kilometres of old mecha will have to be removed, which is now buying "barata".
So far, I'm still living with the contacts I got through the competition
Winning the "Empressary of the Year" contest helped Lukaš Pytloun to sell the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition won the competition "Empressary of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukaš Pytloun de Liberec.
Your success story seems to be taken from a movie.
And Lukas Pytloun loved traveling.
Foreigners realized that in Liberec there was a lack of quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he had gathered with seasonal work abroad and a bank credit he bought a house that was half ruined with five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price ratio of the accommodation in our area moved me to do something about it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
He started renting the first renovated apartment for foreign workers.
All the incomes that I received again invested in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he has managed to gradually open four bed and breakfasts in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, it opened up to another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tizé, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and others are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said the entrepreneur number one last year.
"To this sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped to win the competition of the 'Entrepreneur of the Year'," Pytloun adds gratefully.
Victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding areas.
"People recognized me on the street, still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," she recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends to everyone that you try some company that participates in the competition.
But it considers that participation is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live with contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I've started working on a regular basis."
The reputation associated with success, in its opinion, also included employees,
A total of about seventy.
"I have seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that has gained general recognition."
"It is not, or much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"Only that is my name that appears in the foreground," says modestly today Lukaš Pytloun.
I wish my successor a year quieter than we have had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon became disillusioned with the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone the worst.
The owner of Farmet, Karel Ždjarský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "Entrepreneur of the Year", last year in Prague's "House of Slaves".
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to convert a small technical workshop into a firm with hundreds of millions of businesses.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my colleagues and improved our confidence in fighting competition," says the winner last year.
Farmet's story begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to the father of Karel Ždjarský the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during Communism, he did not hesitate; he resigned his position in the company where he worked and, with a couple of companions, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil press.
Eight years later they became the largest autopress manufacturer in the centre of Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the unspecialized public after achieving success in the competition in the media.
"Not only did our customers start to consider the Farm brand a much better place, but foreign partners also started to appreciate the collaboration with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Ždjarský.
Last year maybe it wasn't in Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for trade results until 2008 and, in part, from 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machinery or technologies.
"We obviously don't get rid of this situation either."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some dismissals," Karel Ždjarský explains.
A viable company should sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, although it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite all this, where Farmet didn't cut costs, it was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent awards at national fairs," Ždjarský says.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and with them the number of new employees.
"The new achievement hopes to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Ždjarský.
A Survey to Reveal Ridiculous Standards
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the fourth business tournament.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Year's Absurdance Survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than one third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials could obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer request an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a control of the insurance taxes," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
The purpose of the absurdity survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year forms for a fourth part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and also begins to create an affection among the general public.
While the last year's edition was attended by three thousand voters, this year almost reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have a number of remaining legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in a number of papers necessary for the tax declaration we are in the first place worldwide," comments Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businesses of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is located in position 74a, that is, eight worse positions than last year.
The absurd competition of the year took place for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Any person may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. The organizer of the competition then selects seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He earns the absurdity he receives more votes.
For this year's survey, more than one hundred were submitted, in particular 105 rules and regulations that did not make sense.
Examples were sent by both businessmen and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that road and highway maintenance vehicles pay the pay or that businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held in early November at Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and social world personalities are often involved.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the competition Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State is constantly making an obstacle to entrepreneurs, so my aim is to eliminate every year at least thirty paragraphs that currently make trade unnecessary," said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the water of drunkenness.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to people was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate with a three-day advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to take a position at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was abolished in the new industrial law.
The second obligation ended in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the office of work by its foreign workers on work trips up to 30 days, was eliminated by the so-called green card law.
And on the third one, the victory goes.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two bascules of soil.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes social enterprises
Environmental, humanitarian, educational and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"This is how we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their environmental activities and support socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone's mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel competition of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's 2010 main competition, companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective were presented.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activity varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, these are persons with disabilities, in other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the 14 finalists of the whole Republic, for example, the Prussian software company Et Netera, which supports the training of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in various sports tournaments.
Another example of the company in charge of the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of funds for sponsoring disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paperstore that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, as they account for more than 70 per cent of the template; therefore, it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also given because it primarily buys Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities produce the least impact on the environment as possible," explains entrepreneur Milusze Ryznarová.
The IT Enlogit company in the region of Ústí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offers them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; it also supports the work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected company in its business events.
"In addition, we support the scholarship Person in a hurry, which specifically helps the local Roman community," comments the company's representative Ondřj Suchý.
They are also located in a good place with a mention of the Praní laundry company to clean up the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive benefits in a special way that affects their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transportation, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, it was automatically appointed to all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company competition of the year that answered questions from the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
Organizers removed forms that were not complete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Company responsible for the year, but were not disqualified from the competition "Principal" Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual nominations for this competition are not allowed, as this is a subcategory of the main competition of the Company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose Consultant.
Police arrested during a public auction in the building of the Agricultural Fund in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police have carried out several arrests in the agricultural fund building in recent days.
The detectives took a local businessman from the media sector and the real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt is attempting to manipulate an ongoing public tender for the refund of rights so that the land under tender would receive it with a precise interest.
That's why I had to pay Lubosh G. half a million crowns.
"For the time being I can only say that the police are looking for someone for bribes during a public auction and public auction," said Právo the chief of the general prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the time being he cannot disclose any more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released a 46-year-old businessman.
The way in which it could influence the public auction, given the lack of official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund answered Právo's questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
"It's a client, not one of our employees," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocation for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the Land Act" and takes place when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the summons, offer a value higher than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the offers, the order of buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the largest offer," explained the Fund's spokesman.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to be brought to the hearing and, at the same time, he was interested because he had acquired several refund rights, proposed to the parties concerned in the field that would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, I had so much money above.
Lubosh G. had had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was charged with disposing of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular where a great road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Then he changed them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the city's own historical center with a very higher value.
In this case, the municipality had to intervene because, otherwise, the land blocked would avoid construction.
Families must pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns a month
Houses will have to pay not only from January for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
Hence, families will have to get out of the wallet, starting in January, several hundred crowns per month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas is about 2%, in some cities they have to pay up to 10% more for water supply, and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns more a year than now.
However, the main electricity suppliers have reduced prices, as support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaic, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately concentrated, especially at a time when heating is more used and, therefore, higher is consumption.
In this case, they must also have a pair of hundreds of crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are rising throughout the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the families of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 crowns per month from January for central heating, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
The residents of Prague must also bear an increase of 9 per cent of the water price and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of the infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the Pragues will pay an additional 6.8 per cent.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be charged 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 floors in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rental from January to 100%.
The company will take those who do not agree with the new rental.
The regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase the year to 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in a way, because it has a slow effect
Fernet, ron, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause them to end up in medical care for young drinkers under 15 years of age.
Children who end up buried in the hospital constantly to overcome the prayer are no longer an exception.
This is due to the experience of doctors with such cases in hospital admissions.
Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk.
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic drinks," says Právo, the pediatrician at Horovice Hospital in the center of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they get a bottle to your father of the alacena, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of swallowing it with zum and not smelling so much," he explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokesman for the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually about Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use a waiting room that they took home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelican, they are 13 and 14-year-old drinkers who usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to Horóvice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in the pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It began at the age of 12, when it was brought with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," says the department's doctor about this case.
"He was at the Holesovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother didn't surprise him that his daughter had disappeared for 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance to drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of dependence.
"A person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a social or family environment that has failed systematically," explains Chief Pelicán.
According to Jurinová spokesperson, this year at Motol’s pediatric clinic, up to mid-November, 40 children were hospitalized.
However, statistics show only those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after walking through medical recognition, go home with their parents or the police, don't count.
In addition to cases where children simply meet after school and drink while waiting, there are three seasonal high places for Pelikan, which can be mentioned: the day of witches, the end of the Year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, drink out of the bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunken children at once," adds Pelicán.
Beverages who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer from a terrible recovery at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a serum with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"These bring him much better, because after the troubled night, they get up well and nothing hurts them."
"There are only confusions about where they are," says Pelicán, adding that patients often lose good sense at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The transfer to an ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost a dozen thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much it has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a job for young people to earn enough to pay that night," adds Pelicán.
Medical insurance, in their view, perhaps as a retroactive measure, which often returns the costs of treatment to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 planes are first found in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced Casa C-295M, left for Seville on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time a device of this kind is in the hands of someone who is not the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for practical or demonstration flights.
This is the version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three planes are L-159.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the Omnipol company, had already taken charge of them last week.
Jan Peešk, from the defence press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the Vodochody planes will be physically withdrawn.
"The L-159 monoplaza aircraft were, on the other hand, separated from long repaired aircraft, without additional investments or contributions by the Ministry."
"L-159T1 biplazas exchanged in their current state," Právo Pejšek said.
He added that the army did not remain without biplaza aircraft, as in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 non-necessary devices for biplazas.
One of the new aircraft has already been received by the army in July, the other will surrender at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed itself to adding aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the one that removes L-159 aircraft and will serve for the practice of pilots from NATO countries."
"Therefore, it depends on the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a home plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3,500 million crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for an invitation to tender and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current Defence Directorate claims that the exchange promotes future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24 so he wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft House may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by making a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three House aircraft and the last should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ant indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the anal are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple proof of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, Professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles indicates.
During the 1994-2009 period, he followed up with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger on the right hand shorter than the cancel.
They had the same likelihood of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the missing finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60%, the reduction was 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined during the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knew the study, but that it does not appear to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "demonstrated entirely".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, ate the snow cover on Thursday.
Roads and rails are mainly covered by compact snow and the quitanieve machines circled all night through many areas.
In the morning, the D5 road was closed between 89 and 93 kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Central Automotoclub (UAMK).
A truck was found at 91 kilometres, in 93 two industrial vehicles were hit and injured.
Several tourists also ended up in the cane.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway in the 185 km towards Prague.
There they hit two trucks.
Drivers must circle slowly after Brno in the 190 km or cross Brno and fit into the 182 km in Kývalce.
There they have formed folds of several kilometers.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
They are forming traps, for example, in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo naměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, another crisis situation will occur in Prague.
Problems also affect railways and airports.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three quickly.
Problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzynje Airport closed from the 11th of the night of Wednesday to the 5th of the morning.
Currently, most of the roads of southern Moravia can already be cycled, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brnońska snowing languages are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far, the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milošovice.
To remove them, it will require frescoes.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will open to circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of Bílé Karpathy (White Carpathies).
The roads in the region, since they are a protected natural area, should simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as ČTK indicates.
In the Czech Republic they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowflakes are gradually sent to the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the moment only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" will win.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise puncture.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives containing it actually causes it to work like a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
There is no doubt that normal protection cannot be used and that when it launches its metallic ashtray killing rain, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audiette, who spoke about the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses a "smart" technology.
"Soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point at it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtain a precise point of view and, depending on it, correct the projection line and press the trigger."
"Let's say 543 meters have been measured."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and the missile is launched at a distance of 543 metres, less than one, two or three metres," Audiette points out.
Displaced 400 jobs
The Fujitsu consortium transfers its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July of next year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu transfers its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As the giant of the computer sector and its maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße street in the district of Niederrad, Frankfurt.
One Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium term, more than 100 employees from the consortium, previously distributed by the region, would be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition to the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure".
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important at present for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new change of an important company in the region yesterday brought joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt's chief of economics, Markus Frank (CDU) said a "Global Player" has been won.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the location".
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great boost to Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) complains about Fujitsu's decision.
The address informed the city earlier of its intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
In the end, economic reasons have fallen.
Thus, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building are cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu at Rathausplatz and the neighbor "Kleine Verticale" were part of the superfluous buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project in the town.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the municipality, a new entrance to the city is being formed, which deals with the criticism of the massive construction that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment advice and rating companies, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, and then Siemens joined the Fujitsu computer manufacturer's house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originating in Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest supplier of IT.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and it also provides the necessary services.
The branch office in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions branch is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this site will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That is why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 20s, its name refers to its star-shaped plan, houses among others the central electronics association and the electronic industry.
Amazon Cancels Server - Threats to Assange
Anxiety is taking hold of Wikileaks more and more.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the disclosure platform from your server.
There may be political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, appears to be detained in England.
The Wikileaks reveal platform is always the white of criticisms, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently seeking an Internet home in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on the list of people seeking Interpol, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the revelation activists reported through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from your server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon service web in order to address the high number of documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we will spend our dollars on hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, they should "stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, informed the CNN chain according to a call to the Lieberman office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with boycott, British "Guardian" reported.
"I wanted Amazon to take these measures before, before the previous information publications classified via Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and disregardful process of Wikileaks puts our national security and threatens life in the world," said a statement by the independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service expand stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is searched for in Sweden for suspected rape, is listed as seeking Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has consistently described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had existed.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's safety, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undiscovered.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to North America's statements.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the responsibility for the revelations of Wikileaks should be judged by treason and executed.
In Canada, a government chief Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there is a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, described Assange as "ridiculous and absurd" to have requested the resignation of the State Secretary, in case she is responsible for recently ordering diplomats involved in spying tasks.
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The US government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of Distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed exceptional officer, the White House announced.
Therefore, Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks filtration.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the US government announced that in order to deal with the security of dissidents and activists, the publication of Wikileaks must be put at risk.
"We have done everything possible to contact them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
In the "Gelato University" in Bologna, refrigerators are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future glaciers has the highest flow and visitors worldwide.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream is prepared in accordance with all the rules of Italian art in the production of ice cream.
The ice cream removes the ice cream from the display with a spatula, extends it over the boat and sells it.
To learn about this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice creams should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream of his machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future glaciers has the highest flow and visitors worldwide.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practice in the fridge of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the mild ice-cream their vague desires.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a European product of quality in the land of industrial ice.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business adviser and wants to create something of its own in a few years of a very stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a refrigerator in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams of their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love the Italian ice creams.
The ice cream teacher Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only their good taste but also their bitter mildness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the birth cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is just the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step towards development seems easy.
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large drum, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently freezes it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine handle and exit a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be prepared only with natural elements or without stabiliser?
How can you give up on some desires to experience?
Luciano advises that they get rid of the trends of the time.
Who speaks of ice cream "not only natural ingredients", for the best has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably gum rubber, of guar frijol.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
Flavors are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes between ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
Besides, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to put flavouring ingredients in their goods."
"However, they must ever experience."
Whether with sorbates of fruit with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with powdered cocoa as the basis for all the possible sweets of chocolate.
Now the participants in the course can use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them develop each and every four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and avellana, with or without eggs in the base mass, with about the aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They also carry out the same experiment with fruit-freeze types.
That you better know doesn't necessarily depend on you having more toffee or more pure fruit.
It is not necessary for vellane ice cream to be dried if it contains more vellane.
The working group develops the ice-cream kiwi, which uses more fruit, less water and something less stabilizing.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
The preparation of ice creams is an artificial problem: The melocoton powder is used with a lot of sugar, and the proportion of sugar of the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano extracts a tool to determine the amount of sugar of the fruit types (measurement of the wine grower for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the account.
Creating ice cream requires no more than physical application, as before.
Not only does it help the tool for the automatic development of the base mass.
There is also a tool, which simultaneously beats the prepared ice cream mixture and cools at low temperature.
In spite of all this, all automation remains out of the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo spots himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit purée, as if he were an uncontrollable giant miniprimer.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's only a matter of time that something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been infiltrated into the industry experienced with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently being formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired in the Ilsi Association for years.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the testing standards of Efsa of genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, criticizing Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a conflict of interest.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa was without the support or the time of transition to Swiss Agrirkonzern Syngenta, and has changed his gang with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Environment Office as well as a clear parliamentary EU.
However, EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, and are ordered in a report.
Experts working in EFSA are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among other things, for assessing the risk to biotechnology without Lobby's responsibility.
Independent experts, such as Then, are critical that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If risks are not sought, how are they to be found?", question, prosecutor, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, few scientists are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday, I was at Stuttgart Station, with the Tube behind my back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to pour down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again became the same: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As I was told, most of the wing became debris.
Path in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rusty soft stone raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Eastfieldern, 43 years old.
It's been secured a couple of pieces.
"This stone is a remnant."
"They shouldn't disappear."
"A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Army ammunition warehouse, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man is dealing with old stones.
He's bought everything that comes from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, torment or send it to the trash," he says in his office, a wooden box that once was a guard's box.
They insulted and threatened him, explaining, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, who had bought the rest of the north wing to the garbage company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the fall.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Approximately 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80 kilo-kilometer meal, with a price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also with the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest of the time it was sold.
Owner of gardens, landscaper, project manager.
They arrived everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and above.
Stuttgart's stone of the impulse has long since become "the wall" or the boundary of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He rides all over the earth, he makes a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a rock lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest stone dealer in the country.
Stop.
In the snow there are art stones of spicy sand.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
It's white, yellow, warm, it exhilarates.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Mark a pile: Red sand, an earlier piece of the Karlsruhe station.
And follow.
"Bonito travertino."
In ancient times, the mammoths belonged to the Neckarstadium of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, the yellow travertine of Stuttgart's police headquarters, the red granite of the Church of Sankt Blasien, went to the hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculptured the stones before and moved them with a simple device and a cart, he feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something destroyed."
It has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people have said to make the stone handler, as well as cantors, a sculptor, a miner, a glasssmith and a gardener have been installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the man who is responsible for taking advantage of the rest.
In a little while, you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talent around great potential
She has an active stream in the buffet.
16 Students swallow around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and Vokswagen car manufacturer have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
By competing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, meet in a body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Your mission: To hire students as soon as possible with the most talent from universities, before entering the labour market and being hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, they try to use exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady in the staff department distributes balloons, gomitas and folders with the VW logo.
Explains to the delusional young talent the programs of practice and work for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University carries the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can get to know students, observe more closely the interested candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so eager to be so direct.
"The main point was previously found in the technical projects," says Selle.
Fighting for fresh graduates is becoming harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If not, they need to be announced and, above all, to get a highly qualified hand of work.
All students of engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its German seals), 40,000 vacant engineers posts existed in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineering gap will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
It organizes expensive recruitment events, such as KPMG careers, a type of modern yincana, in which participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the United States next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election on the exit.
Only the cream of the cream of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly trying to choose and clean up the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey alone was short."
For Casatetalent Dykta, the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some find themselves close to their end, and want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach in the campus, they are also on the hunt, especially small and medium-sized companies, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, who is responsible for the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacancies appear on the company's website.
"It's very complicated to fill the vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors advise that practices can be made with us or carried out their thesis.
No advertising campaigns are carried out for solar specialists.
This is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal environment, wool hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium can't usually offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child assistance or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld is showing place 55 among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
As far as the employee is concerned, I am satisfied that he is with the work and the environment at the same time and is aware of the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff member also expects extra points in his or her classification by his or her graduates to work.
"I believe that the applicant is especially defined in the external classifications of an employer potential," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as employers.
It advises your customers more authenticity.
And that, according to Kriegler, means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer passes through the employees themselves," he assures.
In the core of the sector is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity within its own template.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, you get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama holds new oil drillings
From the coast of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
Washington's government issued a strong ban and thus cancelled its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also in front of the Atlantic Coast, new drillings are currently underway.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What provoked this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the tragedy that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The supporters thus wanted to reduce the dependence of the United States on new foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it has not been clear at all who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A research committee commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the interior, raised the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various peteroleric consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new disaster by using more stringent controls and more stringent security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, which has been charged with corruption charges, has fallen into discredit, is reforming its roots.
Obama announces in parallel that the profitable tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the golf course will be less thanks to stricter regulation, so far.
"Government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of oil and gas industries," says the current survey conducted by the BDO advisory company - before the ban on the extraction of Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are being extended soon, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marble, smells like a gas pipeline: Millions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live in the theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today there will be enough oil in front of your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wandering in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colourful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It can't be seen that brown oil stains float on the surface.
Before he took his legs in his fists, Esther Badom explained on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti River.
In the meantime, the liquid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetlands through a rotary tube.
Fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to get to full waters of fish: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most arid regions of the world.
On the way along the river that passes through mangles, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the engine of the ship removes a hot brown, who dips his hand in the water, will take out some oil fillings.
The roots of the mangrove trees are raised from the ground as dark straws of regaliz, sadly isolated the palm trees that shock and hang their palm trees.
In vain are sought out bands of birds, as if they were in the wetlands as always: As soon as the barrier of the outside is shut, a phantom kind of calm is spread in it from an earlier paradise with a smell of gas.
"What's going on here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari, juror. "We live in constant danger to health."
There's a war comparison.
The ogoni settlement area has been a busy battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers have broken up more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: While they pumped more than two million black gold barrels daily in the whole Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Each two hundred meters surpassed steel platforms such as water sculptures: "Navigating trees" they affectionately called the heads of the perforators.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Every moment a head is missing, Akpobari says, then runs a constant oil run in the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have been spent in the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrated, as in the amber of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological disasters in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the contamination, environmentalists come to the heads to break and pipelines with leaks as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally in the conventional world, scientist Richard Steiner complained to the consortium in 2008: Only the failure indexes of pipes are "more than multiple than elsewhere".
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears a oil-filled workshop under the free sky, figures arise from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among the many barrels, which are sometimes connected to the perforations, sometimes arbitrarily scattered over the ground, fires a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, the gas pipeline through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drops and finally comes out diesel.
Thus, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300 liters of diesel barrels daily: "It gives us 34,000 naira", about $22.
Delta residents take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the largest oil states in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers," who called the pipeline network that goes through Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost per day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the temporary primary material stored is clearly illegally refined: organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military officials, keep the best part in alibis and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic about whether the environmental disaster is due, rather, to the management of the population or the smooth way of production.
"If the oilmen did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of Ogoni are mainly destroyed by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as China."
Michael's getting nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared," says Musculoskeletal Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes illegal refiners, do not threaten to arrest them, or with painful bribery.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This convicted invention has made pieces completely to our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
The A380 appears to have a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline wants to demand the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus who made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than the one you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities experienced a major safety problem in engines of some A380 thanks to their investigations, and warned of a potential factory defect.
The potential of the defect has complex implications: In a connection of manguites, tires can be caused by fatigue or cracks, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic engine failure".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among those found the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline launches legal remedies against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a claim at the Sydney Federal Court that made it possible to take more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline would claim compensation for the November incident.
On the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorating.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of petrol as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be resettled.
Australian researchers announced that they would perform more safety tests for superjumbos equipped with affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas apparatus, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa retired the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Snowflake all over the country causes chaos in traffic
Totally white Germany: From one day to another it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter ice Germany: In almost all of the country cold temperatures were reached during Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow cover of 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited in most highways and in many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the chitanives are in continuous operation, removing the new snow once and for all, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind cover the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) is waiting for live tides with the water level 1.2 metres above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Sajonia, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds taking care of it.
There were many trucks and cars caught there during the night.
Also in Sajonia Anhalt, police authorities reported major street riots.
In the A2, the snow and the wind paralyzed the traffic and created traps.
In Turingia, the snows affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Sajonia, Sajonia Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the fallen trees on the wheelchairs or the damaged chain and the holes are the main problems.
In Sajonia, Leipzig's interurban service is suspended in Nuremberg.
In Saefeld, Turingia an ICE train had to stop her trip to Munich.
The bombers and the rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
The winds with snow cover the streets.
At the largest German airport, the snow wind caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman for the Flight Information Centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport, there are already 40 cancelled flights.
Quitanieves are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers traveling at the airport, although there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
In many streets, there were many accidents on Wednesday afternoon.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident because of the snowy streets: here too a truck was reached on a road crossing because the vehicle was locked up.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, Bayreuth's trip to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, she died a 30-year-old woman, after taking a van with her car near Ashparenburg on a resbaladiz road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dust-type and will therefore be torn down in soft cracks.
But the wind will diminish.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
No doubt it will continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Deuce Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to be separated from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to EUR 500 million.
Recently, Deutsche Bank set up its headquarters: Gemel Towers were modernised in the neighborhood of the banks of Frankfurt; while the bankers returned to their former place of work.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of re-launching, and is looking for a buyer for the two scratches, as said by the Financial Times Deutschland based on a spokesperson.
The spokesperson shall not specify the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again," he said.
That is why Germany's largest credit institution rescinds its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired twin towers in mid-2007 by EUR 272 million from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms have reached some EUR 200 million.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper named "Greentowers" at around EUR 500 million.
If the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or an independent investor has not yet been disclosed, the spokesperson said.
Thousands of people mourn over the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were killed after many explosions in a mine.
However, bodies have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in place of disaster.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the site of the disaster, but it did not find any sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue equipment could be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second intensive detonation, the authorities and experts concluded that there was no possibility that the miners had survived.
The bodies could not be recovered to date.
At present, family and friends remind the deceased of a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright sunlight in Greymouth in the New Zealand South Island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothes and surfboards.
The flags flowed on average even in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface of "the depths of the earth," said John Key, president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot take the death of his son until he has seen his body, says Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the victims' relatives, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also buried.
The rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the island of South New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, Gary Knowles, the chief of the police, told journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the artistic movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the boundaries of the gender with his epic battles "Wallala Rising".
What audience would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he was rolling "Wallala Rising"?
A Viking warrior trapped with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his torturers and murdering his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and rip off his enemies' bodies alive when he is in bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no word throughout the film and the other characters are left to carry for as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful mortal screams.
On the contrary, they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrorous landscapes of Scotland, which the builders offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Better ideal for grown and interested filmmakers in existentialism and in very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a punishment that cannot be dismissed.
Director Winding Refn considers his wilds and trilogy on the peed drug dealer "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he is stochically refusing to make his works be for all the public with something more humor in the main stream or something less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and a few triples that burst cannot deter most of the followers of the artistic film.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and an eternity is stuck in the calm and fog before his team comes to America and goes back there.
It is a shame that "Wallala Rising" has not found a movie distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a disaster against the magnificent images, but also because, after the alleged and bloodthirsty façade, a piece of cinema is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is only a moment of relaxation and its glamorous images and the lupus sound band of trance make him a nude in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which goes from the hearts of the characters to it.
Only a young ruby, who loyally supports Unojo, preserves something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for temporary enemies and allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost in any way.
Wallhalla Rising is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, to change and to be surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA organization of nuclear energy has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the middle of the night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I combat aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the coast of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians appeared to have built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the very appropriate proximity of El Kibar for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
The technique, on the other hand, is only useful for purposes other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of Yongbyon's nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
It was not long ago that the reactor was operating, he said, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is only known that for that time, the puzzles became bigger over time.
The former president of the United States, George W. Bush, recently revealed in his memories that before the attack the CIA was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he only saw signs that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service officers prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation to be "pleasable".
They lack solid evidence, as well as IAEA.
When he was asked how certain it was to have a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat answered in the summer in a stone manner that the IAEA had "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly withdrew from the ashes of the alleged "unutilized military building" and wreaked consciousness on the ground.
In June 2008, however, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by individuals.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a Member State, commercial sellers at the moment just after the attack, which should have a higher information value than that presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always understood that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected him as inversely after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this as well as satellite images.
In addition, drivers are prohibited from a second inspection in the Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not resulted since June 2008 and "has gradually become a serious issue of credibility for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, there is finally a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, which the IAEA observes.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like them still exist.
Inspectors have not made public until the time when teams are being dealt with, what functions they have, or if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandaryah as an internal source of the proximity of the cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is very likely one of the suspect objects.
It may be located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria therefore prohibits the entry into the IAEA of the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the United States has requested the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment due to warnings from the U.S. secret service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three places and the cube on the coast of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high position in Vienna said that at least one of the teams could be "related to fuel production".
But there is no “significance of sensitive activities” or of enrichment of uranium or reconditioning; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is acting with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium should then be separated for the bombs, for these central questions there are, in the best of cases, plausible assumptions.
There is no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are located in the three places.
As hundreds of trucks from the ground have disappeared, no one has information on where the trash remains.
The IAEA considers it unlikely that the salt mine al-Tibni, located in the few kilometres from Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, was recognized by the Syrians in 1998 as a radioactive waste area.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, related it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It can be a coincidence but it only helps to dissipate the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in the diplomatic sector that IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, that the Syrians would allow, in order to maintain the potential military secret, only deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
However, Damascus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago calmed down that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, shuddered at so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the incoming nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This route is very risky: most of the IAEA Board of Governors are needed for this purpose, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious about a climb.
On the other hand, as a diplomat thought, "What if they find nothing at all?"
Love in the Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her debut yet without a name.
She herself has written the script, a story of love between a Bosnia and a Serb.
You don't know much more about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosniak women's associations have quickly protested, with the last time they moved some days planned roundabouts in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no stories of love in the fields of rape, and Jolie's position in this regard delates the victims enough about the script.
His organization, in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, had recommended that Jolie be removed as ambassador, inform the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Culture Ministry that read the script, gave after a shot and a permission to write in Sarajevo, is not quite clear because Jolie did not go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she makes great efforts in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all the parties involved.
Its contents remain inaccurate.
On the network a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and were once again found when she, a Muslim Bosnian, was deported to a Serbian field where he works as a guard.
What sounds quite different is the variant "victim of rape falls in love with torture".
It's certain that Jolie's movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on wrong information".
Currently they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, as many others have done before.
Nothing like far away from here.
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish again.
No Affliction Trace
On the other hand, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans cry out for joy as the loud music resounds, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the Southern Cork, because players are thrown, and found, pingpong balls to beer cups from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a plane ticket to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this extravagant drink game and computer discretion really don't make good jokes.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, to get distracted from the bright question, what will happen to him in the future.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January will hold a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"He's far away from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: Your girlfriend is waiting for you in Auckland, "from one shot she got the job of her dreams as event manager, maybe it's a good signal," says the young man and smile.
Because of the bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
Young people go: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100 000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, the experts in the economy and the social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015 there are 200,000 immigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Prognosis is confirmed, a migratory wave similar to that of the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great welfare to the Irish, melancholy is now expanding.
The economic crisis mainly confuses young, well-trained Irish people, for whom everything is at stake so far.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under 30 are on the stand.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young immigrants, who complain: "In Ireland everything is sinking."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country, and with that for an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the union of Irish students, sees a dark future because the government is only dedicated to mountings and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Note how their companions are from unreputed practices to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnnon are trying to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingObroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing so abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to guide your career," says the manager.
On your website you will find pictures of a kid practicing surfing in Australia and of another practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in galleries, unless it brings freedom and fun.
Half a year ago, Sean O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was no longer anything to be done for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish partners in the construction in Germany.
They are now raising a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he went to Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
O'Donovan sees his country only a few times because he works extra hours to pay a loan to his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, as long ago the first time he walked the threshold of his home.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am never so well."
It laughs something ashamed and goes for iced rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with garden care in front of the houses, large and expensive cars are parked in the entrance.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, it serves hotter tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
Civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he's often listening to right now.
"No one should starve, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in the past here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with this for the first time we feel like Irish."
He laughs and relies on his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let the future hang and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's been working in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend go well in New Zealand?
But in these days there is one thing that concerns you: the celebration of your 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
I'm afraid I can degenerate at a farewell party.
"Only, not too much emotion," he says, and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Sorry, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private enterprises.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes to democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a 40 per cent reduction in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the polls in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
Approximately 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy operates in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but significantly higher than 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but significantly higher in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis was probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and that it has been reduced again this year, up to 32 per cent.)
However, the state of mind varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the polls began, the most surveyed in Latin America mentioned crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31 per cent said that either they or a close relative had been the victim of the crime in the past year, a figure that had been reduced since 38 per cent last year and was the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of the respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are essential for development, while only 56 per cent in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared with 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of those surveyed in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country with greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by the polls in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela bears such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than the fear of foreigners who were trying to help the country to get back after their problems.
Voting was introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, papers shot in the armchairs, destroyed electoral colleges and acts of intimidation.
Election colleges opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen candidates to the presidents, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and requested the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said with caution that "we do not think that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which, according to its opponents, is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The discharge is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request for invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who only has support, if he has any, has gone to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic is affecting the country and more than one million earthquake survivors are still living in shops, a great abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they did not succeed because of a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity documents needed to vote had not yet been distributed prior to the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, according to the patent, the Haitians themselves think so too.
Moving dots towards the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, up to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite all this, which can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the elections of next year will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernández abandons the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that were undervalued by tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened since Kirchner died due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some discrepant members of the pernist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session in which one MP slapped each other in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply next year, which will offer the President an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private calculations, in addition to trade unions' wage requirements, are about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made the growth and reduction of poverty his priorities, instead of control of inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made the INDIC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now frame these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the trade unions.
In addition, their staff state that they want to limit wage increases to 18 per cent next year.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bond holders who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not signed in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the accredited governments grouped at the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6,700 million.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as usual.
Last month, however, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to prelude to the purity of the INDIC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to pursue politics when his mandate is over, given that he no longer has his husband next door.
If you do so, you will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has become tired of the church.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not to repudiate many of your husband's policies calmly.
Media swears by China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his big brother on the other side of the narrow?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the eligible, turned on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a defender of the continent's feelings, creating innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but little by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five elections to the mayor, he failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DDP), which has leaned towards total independence from Taiwan, gained almost 50 per cent of all votes against 45 per cent of the KMT.
If they were presidents, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since its election two years ago, the proportion of votes of its party has decreased by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the PPD stuck with KMT in the municipalities.
In the elections, the typical elements of Taiwanese elections were seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with banners and light girls dancing.
Nor did the mysterious attempt to kill rigor fail.
Sean Lien, Lien Chan's son, honorary president of KMT, was campaigning for one of KMT's candidates the night before the elections.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly to his face, wounding him and killing him.
Curiously, it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or avenge himself on the candidate.
In any event, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean on the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not the matter of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat of China.
Therefore, KMT often avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
This time, however, the PPD also avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy on China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Government of Beijing is expected to continue to submit to trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to life.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but the first is the first.
The best thing is to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to happen.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
The President between 2000 and 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under Mrs Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is trying to attract professionals and young people.
Ms Tsai has been welcomed as a candidate for the PPD presidency, as well as her Tseng-chang, who has fulfilled her mandate under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to demonstrate that you can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for the establishment of an expert group acting as a contact point between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations could be conducted without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to present himself to the presidents.
Even without the assistance of Mr Chen, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT should also carry out an examination of the conscience.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between the rich and the poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says he will restructure his office as well as local teams.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprising choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president, and perhaps people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz singer and basilica personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure of jazz since its 2008 album, "Experience", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the Grammy's rules, according to which it must be an artist who has not released more than three albums on the market before recording what "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly made great progress and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the way to success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy's voters, who have recently concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the other categories, Grammy voters did their best to honor Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is the veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and the technologist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite sprinter in New Orleans and usual guest in HBO's Treme, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest tends considerably towards fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lobber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained a worthy recognition in the category of major groups, competing against the great Billy Childrens Assembly and the ever-risk Dave Holland, whose album is live with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the basilica in his band.
Grammy Awards: Michael Daughterty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main appointments were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey by "Dreamhouse", a work for three movements.
Among those nominated with links with southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a play commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated by his Mandolin Concerto.
Classic music nominations are distributed into thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classic music album are Bruckner by the Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by several artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers appointed to a Grammy by contemporary compositions include Pärt by Symphony No. 4, Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze by "Amphasively Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 ended in Disney Hall in January 2009 at a meeting recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, approximately 30 minutes away, is added to "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated by the instrumental soloist performance with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to play it in Mandolin Avi Avital, which played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"The composition of the Middle East sounds and numerous scales and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was appointed to the orchestra function category, leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
The appointed instrumental soloists include the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sophie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, Soprano Jesse Norman was named by his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the Board of Management
The Temecula mosque project has received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project, saying it promotes terrorism and traps.
However, the committee members decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or Bahai, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud of you."
"Shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"Only they speak very loud."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who interceded for or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"The United States no longer exists", read in one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of Seeds with Mrs. Libertad dead in the arena."
"America has fallen."
The plans to build Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 took place.
In the valley of Temecula, the imman Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living without problems in the Riverside County, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse that he rented in a shared property with a water filter system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two mines and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
The opponents can still appeal the project to the Municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbial poses the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although researchers have discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it demonstrates that there may be life forms without the main elements that they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it something very peculiar, though little is needed to be a really 'foreign' kind of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of the publication Science on Thursday.
For a long time, six major elements of life have been considered: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing the phosphorus by arsenic.
"It makes you wonder as much as possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it has.
The study focuses on a microbial discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press wheel to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated great Internet speculation on the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there might be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider necessary for life may not be so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the investigation team.
"This work is innovative because it demonstrates the substitution of one element by another in the basic biochemical and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not carried out by chance.
Happy Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, who conducted the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbial exposed to both could replace each other.
"The arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"It may therefore be difficult for the agencies to differentiate them."
"However, the arsenic is quite different than so that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, in some way, calls for biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
Microbial grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that you can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that you can naturally exist an arsenic-based life form, either in other parts of the Earth or in another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea of replacing arsenic with phosphorus was not new, but had never found an example to prove that it works.
The arsenic was more common in the first centuries of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other ways of generating life, not only the way life was formed in the ancient earth," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The stolen dogs that were missing in Compton have been found
The two dogs missing from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel were found, according to the officers of the sheriff of the Los Angeles County County on Thursday.
The four competing dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Gales Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, as the authorities pointed out.
Two of the canines were recovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the two others were found on Wednesday afternoon, as Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson from the sheriff's department in Los Angeles County, reported.
"The good news is that dogs are good," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They have returned with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"A research is being carried out."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some clues."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to show in the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of dogs, continued to disappear until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and had the intention of showing Trace.
The other dogs were going to show them in other competitions scheduled for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba Championship, as Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops in the nearly two-month tour that the couple takes part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked-in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They took three other dogs (a boxing creature, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a very thick coat and would be fresher.
They left the windows slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the robbery of the van on Tuesday at six o'clock in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to rot again, while the restructuring of MGM achieves the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light to start again.
On Thursday, a New York federal bankruptcy judge officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to erase about $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and outsourcing of films and television programs.
Thursday's failure confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to resume under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned credit instrument of $500 million to finance operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the Moelis and Co. investment bank was hired to advise on the management needed to manage its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former president of Enron and expert in the recovery of bankrupt companies, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's efforts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company on sale at the end of 2009.
However, the auction attracted few posters and no willingness to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves the banknote in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-millionaire bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper companies, which have been collecting $375.000 per month for their company management services, will receive $4 million "successful fees".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which only produced a film this year, and gathered an annual pizza of seven or eight films that will come out in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The study needs to conclude a separate loan of $265 to $275 million to finance its part of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who holds approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep your gift budget balanced
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant bet in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bicycles each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings decorated with accounts, or about 48 Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toys vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholeesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Act has been working; this year's technological toy is likely to have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most famous of these, Webkins and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the toys driven by button stacks are increasing, as well as the toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are skin toys of the size of a cobweb that sing a note when their stomachs are tightened.
A pendulum is equal to a note, and a second pendulum begins to arm a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pushing, you can't stop.
For combined dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking a loan from Elmo Live technology last year, the 14-inch cartoon doll plays turn shift games like Simóm Dice, and can take the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a bag full of questions letters designed to convert a car ride into a meeting with a current self-correction exercise schedule.
If you are afraid to give your child your smart phone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech (60 dollars, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, from 3 to 12 years), it is the first important point of the Leapster line, with a new and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-type system to present games and electronic books, and has a slot for SD cards that allows viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a five-block game just bigger than a bead box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to arm words by putting the blocks in line before the time ends; it is formidable for an improvised competition of armed words.
They are increasingly toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys, the two largest are Webkins and Club Penguin.
To buy your son an online pet at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Penguin Club 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, 6-12 years old) that includes a currency with a hidden code.
When you change the online code, your child gets enough credit in the Penguin Club store for two articles.
These could include wheel pads or a pet Puffle toy.
slightly larger than the pig's toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last on a microrobot line driven by button stacks.
The false insect moves rapidly over 12 silicone legs that vibrate in random directions.
It is fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if you can find the output.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside the mouth of our dog.
A more moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As a sergeant urban instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the passage into a city square, scrupulously inspecting the nerves of the people in charge, issuing low-voice orders with military authority.
He wanted women members of the gang, the police corpus of the city order of China, feared and despised by their capricious energy measures and their tendency to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Company!"
"Look out!"
Show them, he smiled, "How beautiful girls are!"
Four girls who just passed adolescence with white gloves and green olive jackets identical and adjusted pants to call attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly above the hair tied with monkeys to blue and white rays.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, emphatically.
"Models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clear the image of the city inspectors in China.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the greyish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidation: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a snack cart disco, and observed it with the constantly frowned ashes for half an hour, until the outpatient salesman picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically elected by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police to the Tusk a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's infinite respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to carry out city orders, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in the province of Hubei killed a transistor after using their cell phone to film them while disbanding a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it described how to hit criminals effectively without causing them to bleed.
This year, a walking salesman from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a queen with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, presents to inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chenguan has left a scar in the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another debate on tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really mediculous cleaning."
The skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through an eight new female recruits notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a staged distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's notice asked for female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonic facial features".
They should have a height above the average, over 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," an anonymous district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and inner qualities".
The Chengguan women are like florists, he said, and added, "Never be florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not anxious to support that description.
But he noted that the height requirements were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means betting, it is a matter of debate between the Chinese.
Of course, the minor or disfigured must not be presented.
"We can't allow a man or a thief to come to work here," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be fine."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Plaza Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colored beads and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent in her face is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old workmate, Xu Yang, said, "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also do not oppose their work at a certain time, they said, because they have higher career ambitions than simply to pressure sellers on the streets where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces about a dozen hikers who are thrown on foot or on a bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu pancakes or tazones as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily leaving his car thrown by a bicycle with tapes.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausters.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studied marketing in her free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the sellers' merchandise.
They can only threaten by reporting criminals to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animity against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, were killed after spreading the false rumor that Chenguan officers had murdered a seller.
More than a dozen police officers or officers in Chenggan were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were either pushed or caught by fire.
Xindu has for the time being avoided such violence.
But calm is only guaranteed.
Only two streets from the peaceful Plaza Baoguang, where women's officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the steel rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed cruelly.
The situation was halted for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened up to the cods to their vehicles and were quickly with the motorcycle and their owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white badge given back to hide his name.
Like women's officers, coordinators, 40-year-olds or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total nature.
"Most of the time is the public who starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that prosecutors of the Department of Justice have excused Senator John Ensign from criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the husband of women.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national holders last year and damaged his career.
The Ensign office said it was "surely happy" for the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The Senator could still face a disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign lawyers said that the Department of Justice had informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him on this issue.
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have conjured up to violate a federal crime ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative job through lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's business with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign was contacted with several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's work and counseled on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to do lobbying for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded from the law of lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were intimate friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving by lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees to use their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolutionary door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political proceedings after several important reviews for its section of public integrity, including last year's decision to abandon proceedings against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of mistrial charges.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department didn't want to raise charges against his client.
The Ensign defence team had been cooperating with the prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable entering into details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which claims that a $16,000 payment from Ensign parents to Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The electoral committee said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was only a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had supported the senator for a long time, which got work through lobbying thanks to the help that Ensign gave Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's cabinet chief, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "masking" the Ministry of the Interior on a controversial issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called the Transport Secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to do lobbying.
When the news of last year's affair first appeared, Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that he planned to post a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesperson Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
" Senator Ensign wishes to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the rows of the courtroom.
One minute a minute, they sent reports of the amazing testimony on Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were over 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that approached the rape and children attached to their beds in a house that was caught in the fire.
On Thursday, the trial followed extensively by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to arrive at an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have submitted written statements in court that outline the arguments of the appeals likely to be brought before the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by media journalists, created "a circle atmosphere", and such immediate and generalized saturation with elevated details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force the appeals judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's right to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ulllmann, chief defence lawyer Mr. Hayes.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court, laconically rejected the claims in a case last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been led by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the Appeals Tribunals have recognized that the coverage of famous cases may raise questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a historic case of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of a osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, that there was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television program and the movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' convictions half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in high profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of Stanford Law School, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report stating that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more just.
The Twitter question is just one of many topics outlined by Hayes' lawyers, who will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been damaged when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury members, showing them speculative photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were terrified by the victim's photographs, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela of 11.
Defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that he wrongly pressured a verdict for his foreign decision to order the jury to deliberate for one weekend.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media kept throwing wood at the fire of emotion over the case.
"The daily accumulation of tweets from the media, the cameras and reporters outside the court," lawyers said, "there has never been anything seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state."
Your attention to the coverage of Tweeter is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly was a controversial vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeals courts often felt drawn by the arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes lawyers are pressuring that claim.
In his letter, he referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court of 1966, which revokes Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would require the new media to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can the citizen tend a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a notable campaign of invective and negativity, this week has triggered a bit of civilism in Washington.
Is it a prelude to genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a rapid return to the partyist struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not lead to any progress in the major issues to be addressed during the upcoming meeting.
But as everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to win party points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the President's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months has generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is only enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both parties are in a trial period, searching for each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partyist war.
The reason why the meeting of Tuesday and subsequent evaluations of the meeting by the participants were made with a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid change in the climate that existed during the last two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, both parties are on the contrary.
In any case, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to how to say things," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Public Ethics and Policy Centre.
"They're inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse party passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing meeting, the Republicans and Democrats have no option but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are won at the end of the year, and nobody's in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to increase unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefit for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism about possible treatment of these issues during the upcoming meeting, along with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, from Brookings Institute, warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
"After things that must be done are carried out, in the short term, psychology will turn the situation into a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civil society can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who have made a decisive contribution to its creation.
With greater awareness that the Republican leaders have the dangers of overstepping their position, they know that they should strive to fulfill their promises to cut state expenditures and abolish the new health law.
These lines are already clearly reflected in the initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and the retirement age and the cost cut.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have put the issue of the deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The highest resistance is among the staff elected on the panel, suggesting that there are at least few bases or desire for commitment in fiscal matters at present.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of side effects when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bilateral cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partyism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a dead point, as happened in 1995, then both parties will observe the reaction of people with care.
Anyone who considers that he is losing will probably change course and seek commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partisanism and polarization are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of the Congress than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on the part of both sides to find points in common on issues that still divide them.
A U.S. filtered document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves part of the bribes and protection money that directly collects to the Kremlin, according to the U.S. Embassy in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority", takes part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he blamed him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of cleaning ever since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied corruption charges over the years, and he has won several claims per libel on such charges.
In September, when a Russian television channel was asked about a documentary that suggested that it was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's a patron, it's a joke."
According to surveys, the Russians believe in an overwhelming way that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the ambassador's report, and it is unheard of to be the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct slabs of the government of the city of Moscow with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to say that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," the note says.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means 'tempo' or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the government's bureaucracy in the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a structure of three levels in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is the highest."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies and that the police are targeting small businesses.
One source, the report stated, "explained that Moscow's commercial owners understand that it is best to obtain the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while money collection is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but he has confessed that he has made little progress.
The ambassador's note reports about men taking bags, probably cash-filled cash, within the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of the Indem group of experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no more a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on the overall perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified as 154 (the countries are classified at least as the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy's note, which did not occur until late into the evening of Moscow, will certainly cause dissatisfaction within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin argument that the problem is being resolved.
Interviewed with CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be false and responded in anger by a revelation that said that US diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemeres forced to face the past
In an illuminescent concrete classroom, with exposed walls and chasms, the head of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man that he had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemeres Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said 42-year-old Sring Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the Red Jemeres government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Red Jemeres fortress in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former organization soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres surrender to the government, the long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face those who had participated in the regime publicly.
In June, the government distributed here a textbook of secondary school text which for the first time teaches the story of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodia joint court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemeres, judging the former head of the known Tuol Slang torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemeres of Anlong Veng, complicated efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemeres was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the Government of the Red Jemeres of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and defeated the government led by Pol Pot, the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country ' s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemerians began to desert the government, culminating in the returns of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of its beneficiaries, the oldest Red Jemerians fought in absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Red Jemeres officers kept their local administrative positions instead of depositing their weapons, Racian soldiers remain poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have gained few benefits after surrender," Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation said, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept of business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before being dedicated to life as a farmer of poor rice in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeres was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave him to eat everyone."
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-sufficient."
The current Red Jemeres Court has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, it is expected that the court will begin trialing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Red Yemeres minister.
The mandate of the court is to prosecute the main leaders and those with greater responsibility for the crimes, but it has not stated whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This is not much served to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Red Jemeres government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre researchers that she had supervised the construction of Trapeang Thma's arrest, a project that was thought to have killed thousands of forced workers.
During a recent rainy afternoon, Im Chaem again worked in the fields at his house on wooden pilots on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun dropped long shadows on the dry past, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She claimed that if the court did not bring her up, she would not.
"Camboya is in peace and stability," he said.
"If there's more processing, there'll be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Jemeres in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court prosecutes more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Camboya must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first text book approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the book of history of secondary school history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little details about the Red Jemeres, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touche Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng Secondary School, said that the new textbook helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But her parents reacted with skepticism when she took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they're not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the text book and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemeres preserve a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with waste plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black hole covered by an oxidized roof of hojalat.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the side of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many of the local people go there to pray to him," he said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day he decided to walk to Pol Pot’s last resting place, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas with the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its qualified uranium reserve for armament
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it would give up its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations had been carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for the arms of a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important results of the nuclear security summit of 47 nations chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And by the way it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all the nuclear material that is vulnerable worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to rid themselves of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, had stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for armament) and the low-rich uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said that the first task of withdrawing the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made on a plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of low-enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working in the Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of qualified uranium for weapons, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the joint declaration.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to the fierce repression of Lukashenko's human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential distance.
It was stated that "as long as progress is welcomed on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners directed to Guantanamo for Spanish territory, as the US ambassador to Madrid said on a telegram.
This is reflected in documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that then the government's first vice-president, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe in which he accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between the former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken Zapatero's Government out of the way" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"From the Vega he stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "depressed pills," Aguirre reports in a cable.
The then Foreigner, Miguel Angel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "want to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, when he was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence".
For his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González sent to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to request the disclassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any criminal element or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern at the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the classified information of the NCC or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent researchers will complicate our efforts to manage the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007 at lunch between the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he said that "although Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of rhetorical inflammation, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern at the PP's performance in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these disclosures have negative consequences for the US Government," he said.
The Parish confession complained on the network of "agobio" being mother
The young woman was talking about the child when she was already dead and had a blog: "Terrorism in the Gallagh"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he used as a child, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natures of Noah, the Korean people from whom she came.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their emotional life, which ABC rebuilds through the testimony of his family.
The 30-year-old Galega began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tunez, an industrialist.
It's been a year.
When they left him, she was soon supposed to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him be tested for DNA.
It wasn't long before he met another boyfriend.
The elected was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring town.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to investigate the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even went with her to Palma for a week.
But because of the content of the communications, it can be seen that his romance was broken, that they broke.
In March 2008, he is in Menorca alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mosquitoed, because I have come to work."
"When I said that it seemed good to him, but of course, now he realizes what it is to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants to do."
Then he says about a message to the phone that he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll pick it up when she comes back," she claims.
In May, he speaks of returning to his people: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to be there until the 19th, because the 20th I have to present to you a job not to lose it."
Of course, if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"It's going to be who, or with me, and never in my life will it happen to me again with no one who is not my mother," doubtful intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, is supposed to be killed on 10, is dead.
"Caesar is pleased on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other, he's going to class almost every day."
It's about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He will go there (the child) to some summer classes, and so save me a bit of kangaroo pasta."
On 17, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"He says Alberto sent you I don't know what videos to email, look how when he wants to find me, he has to fuck."
On 30, another: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's making money for me."
On the Internet there are your messages on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the incarcerator."
"Terror in the galliculous (epigraph)."
The last man who lived with her, keeps an oath, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything happened because he didn't tell him he was a single mother.
Monica joined Palma's provincial penitentiary yesterday, from the centre of Menorca's judicial detainees.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "or had intended to cause any harm to the minor".
Earlier, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 seats at Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in the votes and MEPs experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already seen the general view, so whether or not the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this training obtains in these committees is often doubled to what it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics, the figure rose to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384,091 votes.
To maintain this upward trend, which has been fuelled by a transfer of PSC votes and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this training have calculated that if general elections were held, the PSC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a MP - now it has three - while ICV would stay with a MP or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is kept, the most immediate date will be held in May 2011 with municipal commissions, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their prominence in front of the Barcelona Parliament, one of the most budgeted administrations - EUR 661 million for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility that the PSC loses the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get the majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this training to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistency - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can take the lead in the Tartarconese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has located only 500 PSC votes, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they have met several times.
Popular people have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the highest number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detainees of the General Police Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a yihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Land of Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the author of the last of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to ensuring that with the "Kampai operation" the Al Qaida falsification apparatus has been "debilitated" at international level and, therefore, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that during the two years that have been active in Catalonia, the cell has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the Al Qaida criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The disarmed cell is not the only thing the jihadist network had in operation in Europe, so that in addition to Thai services, other European police units were involved in the investigations, so it is not clear that in the EU territory there will be similar strikes in the coming days as in the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Ashhar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another development took place in Thailand with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikalaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who led the cell settled in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists who met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents should be on behalf of men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
Through the investigation it is pointed out that, at the moment, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it can be recalled that days before this attack was committed, some $1,000 were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that was "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" who ended up with the lives of 106 people.
The police have been seized with extensive documentation.
The PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Arthur But his conditions to support his investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to disregard the filo-soverenanist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to place in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans went to the meeting of Arthur But with the assurance that he had obtained 18 MPs in the elections last Sunday, he was more than enough to make himself wanted, as the candidate for the CIU needs at least one of the opposition's training to abstain from the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to keep at Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, the talks they hold these days but with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereign and independent speeches will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergence leader even intends to submit a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their bets to slow down the political apparatus of a highly inflated self-government and to eliminate the tax on inheritances and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the investment of Mas will be taken up by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But it has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today she will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "the lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot don't refuse to have their locker kill over 11 elders
The managers of the charity La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press wheel to highlight the damage to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while employed there killed at least eleven elders in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the law firm, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil servants".
And it is that, in addition to the social degradation that the entity may suffer for failing to detect the criminal activities of the jailer in time, the great threat to Caritat is now gaining a form of substantial compensation that is already being calculated by the legal representatives of the victims ' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that she has not stopped killing ever since.
The judge had already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients of the geriatrics - who suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the deceased, but that, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the treatment was disbanded by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, yesterday rejected this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no indication in this case that there has been an unwise action by any other person who is not the defendant himself".
He was already baptized as "Angel de la Morte" confessed 11 murders earlier and details that the first crime committed him on August 29, 2009 to kill a second grandmother, a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused death by injecting him with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed by helping him with a mixture of sedated pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to the medicines.
Insulin pinches and sedation cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his aim to alleviate the suffering of the internally, used to kill them.
But it will be the analysis that is being carried out in the laboratory that must clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, embraces them inside by giving them away as she has already confessed that she did with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the jailer, nor even to the number of reported murders, which do not disprove that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the judge and in the little sense that he has to change his way of doing after he has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that justice is made available to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is threatening
The investors responded abruptly yesterday to Trichet's yesterday's threat that he warned "the markets should not underestimate our response capacity".
Peripheral differentials have been strongly closed and European banks' actions have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes and the euro has only responded which is a worrying sign.
What has happened yesterday is itself from an illicit market that, just as it explodes, recovers but is motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will delay the loss of fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years and the remaining.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan for ineffective and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in a timely manner, leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bonus purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be blinded by withdrawing liquidity measures, that God is watching us!
Just as at their May meeting, at which they claimed that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and had collapsed markets, tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, he announced the bassica on Monday and Wednesday that he had already bought a lot, causing a new market outbreak.
Yesterday the auction of letters to one year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and other 15,000 potential and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain the parliamentary approval of its new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which a political commitment is needed that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy hymn.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has increased by 4.5%, the double that the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and decisive and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a three-year bonus auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope that it will be resolved with strong demand and help to resolve the doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Help Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 4 billion in cash available the triple that in March, to expensive types and closes access to the markets without saying.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's woman, "in addition to being, it seems."
I mean, we can.
The President of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicily requested by his children
The time is not running out in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will object, considering it "full-right void", to the court board of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to make use of their majority and to deal with the management bodies of the signature holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are refining the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their fight for control by the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to give up in his dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
Of its board of directors, five of its seven children were expelled who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose objection is recorded in the Mercantil Registry.
The court board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the Magistrate of Madrid's Merchantil Number 2, has reopened the box of truenos within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants' five children to try to validate and heal the radically void board of 18 January, through procedural error and abuse of law, according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the Board's appeal once it is concluded that it is "full-right void".
The same protagonists, who remain discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the magistrate convene a board in June.
In El Enebro, heritage society and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, that 51 per cent of the capital is used in accordance with family protocols.
This matter is the fundamental issue that the judge should decide once the view on the appeal is held, for which there is not yet a stated date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this selection of speed universe has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one considered the options of a newly arrived squadron and, despite the upward trajectory of the last few seasons, last November, in the final line of the championship, all gambled for the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso's triumph.
Without undermining the skill as a pilot of the finally champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the power of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany placed on the market in 2007 for very remote purposes from high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design manufacturing factory assembly chains around the world, energy plants, high precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before actually constructing it, thus avoiding avoidable errors and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s planes, or Nissan’s most famous commercial cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in his Formula 1 faction has allowed Red Bull to design and effect "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements that are detected during the race and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the shields in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 high-skilled young professionals work, who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and design all kinds of changes in the bolus.
Siemens' director explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull's balls except for the engine, which is of Renault's full responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be taken from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced high-tech laser and autoclave production systems.
As a single limitation of this madness of technological development, the figure is $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at the maximum in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech factory to design and produce its bubbles in a locality about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered a "high secret".
The template for this event is 580 people, including its two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero is no doubt the latest Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the huge technological resources the energy beverage brand has put into service its participation in the circuits, other protagonists are hidden whose competition is invaluable and their nobility is null.
The factory technology chief Steve Nevey said that five years ago, it could be said that R+D advances in road cars contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology amounts to 85 per cent of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install its own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive joint store yesterday in Barcelona, his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The Vice President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set an example of the remodeled shop located in the Grand Via Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which he has been working for 30 years.
The US group has prepared a plan to place 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also ensured that the philosophy of installing stores will always be the same, based on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be played in an interactive manner), which in Europe will have the same image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a free trade system and stressed that the exclusive trading network intended to "improve customer and pymes service in the purchase, attention, postage and even packaging".
The Barcelona Store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that is responsible for solving the potential problems of HP computer equipment in security.
An online service connects to a technical center located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, as large companies have already hired technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bet to 'robber' a million customers to their rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell's deputy advisor, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but initially it rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a break in the margins of interest, which will seek to offset in part the rise in commissions and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, their outstanding assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will have a three-year validity.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public aid, is to win a market share with the capture of one million new private customers -700,000 if those who can get out of the bank are discounted, their large outstanding allocation, since so far it has been feeding more SMEs and businesses than the retail client.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it is more than 10%.
Another of the foundations of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year's plan for Optima Director, set four years ago, although initially it was for three years, but the market situation has led to a further exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main target.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental to the survival of banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the passive war - which penalizes the margins - is reducing, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their issuances for liquidity is already being transferred to the credit price to compensate for the fall of the margins.
"The theme of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the grip, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already ordered his network on Thursday to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials - see FiveDays of 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the bank's trend now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
The management plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not reject corporate operations.
Not in vain, make sure that in Spain "greater sizes are required."
"The coming year will move everything," he assured.
He states that capital needs are "very high" and does not dismiss any Spanish financial entity into red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market with funds before new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it remained important for some bankers to Vatican as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which depletes the crisis.
ECSC rejects a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that there would be a flood of mergers of savings boxes and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When he started the process of concentration of Spanish savings boxes, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that this new wave of operations was going to take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Bank group cannot be said to be a second round, which is adjusted."
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has also collaborated very much in this," the director pointed out.
In statements during a breakfast of the Aragón Guidelines and Executives Association (AEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is being affected "as quickly as possible, and we must be very satisfied with how it is going to happen within the time periods that, not now, have been marked in business plans with the Bank of Spain," he stressed.
"To move from 45 cash with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no paragon in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky views on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ensured that Spain has the most stringent financial system in all of Europe and "probably" of the world, and assigned those who put it on trial a "lack of knowledge".
The directive pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings funds, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "go as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
The tensions on the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or the abolition of 426 euros of non-performance aid, up to the privatisation of 49% AENA, management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined in criticizing Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to resolve the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not an error in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is again a turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is shocked by the fact that it maintains the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, inter alia, would leave the monetary area in the south.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now science seems fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, is close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the proposals of the sisters for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries of transit, possible suspensions of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defining itself for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government withdrew from Manga a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of differences between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigidity and stability in public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second forward was the central European country when Merkel penally extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was already the subject of critical ferocity, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and public opinion were very opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, requiring the reform of the Union treaties, in order to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run at the expense.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as the Irish crisis and everything else has collapsed.
However, its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reforming the Union which enables those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that will not cross.
And it is telling all of us that, although we now have to take measures that may not agree very well, from that date the former operation of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which offender countries will be severely punished, may be required to be declared in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a steep path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand.
It is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to greater peace.
And that we take advantage of the opportunity window they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifestation (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms to Merkel, the thesis has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't seem to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, the abandonment of a monetary area that is too sloppy from less serious countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany can always tell us that it has already warned us.
Sport and fraud of law
Trets like those of Alonso and Ramos in front of the Ajax show engineering but do not want to escape a penalty.
The alleged expulsion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party on 23 November against Ajax in the League of Champions has caused ink to be written about whether or not such behaviour is anti-sportable and whether or not both players should be punished by UEFA.
As it is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the match (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time to draw missing paths to cause the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since the Real Madrid will be the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory penalty for the next party of the league, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clear cards to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned two parties with the team coach José Mourinho and with different economic quantities for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather often in the world of football.
It is so extensive that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case reported is that it has been staged by a team of the Royal Madrid entity (which in its hymn assumes dignity and honor, and has on past occasions fined its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds a further episode to its long history of hysterical and provocative technique.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such behaviour that is not expressly prohibited by the regulation is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether such actions constitute a fraud of law; indeed, they are actions that are respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to be misleading.
The issue is to examine the kind of damage that causes the sports spirit.
One of the things that the sports spirit understands is the physical integrity of the opponents, which was not put at risk by these actions, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these goods that is referred to with the clean game is to avoid unfairly exploiting the team of infringing players, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradox of the action of the players in Real Madrid is that it was not settled to what we normally characterize as fraud or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not done secretly to try to avoid the punishment, but that precisely its action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage do offenders gain from the intentional mistakes they have examined.
It seems necessary to note here that it does not put itself in a disadvantageous position to the rival or benefit in the same party, as the result of the action obviously means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it's also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club can't count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of uncertainty, as the team can be removed from the first shift, and in addition to this action, players perform a penalty party and pass on to the second card cycle, in which the card accumulation suspension takes place with less than in the first cycle.
So if you're going through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, of which it is part of making strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In the case that we are concerned, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud of law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without getting punished or running away from it.
Although the boundary between the engineering and the fraud of law is diffuse, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, I think, arises by two factors: because it was about two auto evictions and the way in which the directive was transmitted to them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture group Christmas dinners at the NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates on an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
Self-supplied celebrations are spread by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tournament and lottery, with the arrival of December, the group dinners before Christmas are also back, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for Barcelona's restoration and leisure, but which because of the crisis have resulted in a price-adjusted attack to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations in the interviewed sector agree.
In order to make accounting more complicated, this year's calendar (when Nochevieja falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests on the week of December 13, with the result until the date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for days (on 16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As has already happened since 2008, when the phase of flat cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners by budgetary issue.
To avoid disregarding tradition, many workers keep it paying off their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, some and others require battle prices, confirm the President of the Barcelona Restauração Gremi, Gaietà Farrás.
The employer's representative, today, does not dare to Vaticanize what this month's celebrations will be like.
"People think so much before booking."
"He wants to get out, but he has the alerts on the price issue," he points out.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service", adds, and remembers that customers tend to take a step down with the crisis, so that the margin around the 25 euros has become the majority of the demand.
A survey of various central establishments found the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
In the Soteras Group, there is a genuine boom of applications for Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has brought with it more early reservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
In AN Group, which abandons El Mussol, Attic, Ququ, and up to a total of 23 places, they maintain optimism after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and a few good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The group's sources emphasize that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the parties.
At its six group menus, they have added one anniversary, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a readiness to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as a cave.
They also see green shoots in some companies that invite their employees again and feel that the volume of groups is something bigger.
On behalf of the patron saint Fecasarm (including entities such as the Barcelona Bar Association, Restaurants and Leisure Association), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts to start to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that the reservations are "animal", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That's right, the illusion for the parties has not come down, to pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the clarifications and judicious details that offer about the content of the conversations and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decrees", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but are stored by components to make it difficult for them to be destroyed in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for unveiling in Washington.
This is what Ambassador Anne W. Patterson listed in a previous report to visit the then National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to territory under the Taliban attack, the noisey dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as a proliferator and reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the fall of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a meeting with their US counterparts.
The latest documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high rate of Pakistani nuclear arms production.
A letter from the embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustant", states: "Transparency is often nonexistent; aid offers remain unanswered or discarded".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "make it very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end with tactical support for terrorist groups".
To the hunt of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol emits a red warning in order to follow the movements and locate Assange where it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Furthermore, it is not new, but it is the date of 20 November.
And it does not have to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse faced by the Australian in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks Creator's lawyer Mark Stephens assures us that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was the 20th day when the international police body based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after obtaining permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member countries, as explained by the organization, consider the so-called free notice network to proceed to an arrest -- which must reach the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement was outraged by Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to respond by videoconference to the Swedish authorities' questions.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the Missive denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence-- Assange remains in an unknown, but not silent stand.
On Monday, from an indefinite location, he gave an interview to the Time magazine director through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the UN by violating international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the motion for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," he told the CNN chain.
Obama himself has been responsible for the anti-terrorist struggle, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to remain important to Assange contrasts with the views expressed today by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chaired by the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, has asked the Department of State to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and pursue any of their contributions or assistance".
Even further, Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to retire after saying Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, Arkansas ex-Governor and a possible candidate for the presidency.
"Anyone in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," said Fox.
Puigcós search for peace in ERC with guides to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for issuing the 11th internal revolt in the rows of the ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his hideout is insufficient for the likes of the outgoing Joseph Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that he can in no way cause the headbreakers that he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the Left leader will try to win over the new critics with guides that allow them to protect themselves until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national councillors from the ERC could speak on their secrecy.
By paper, and not by hand.
If the charodists want to give a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the line wants to avoid the image of division as well as submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not be considered ratified with half of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would also not be a good result "to Bulgarian".
The next to Carod require the president to make his position available to the militants, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But when they do not have enough to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map from here to May.
To that end, they look forward to participating in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be put to the vote by the national council on day 18.
Its intention is to use Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to advance the convention in the fall of 2011, something that the dome already gives in fact.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that "poliphony" damages stability and that its aim is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty traps from door to door.
In this line, it is symptomatic that the consultant in the functions of Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the Innovator said in fact that the leader will be rescinded "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, two of which stand out.
The first, to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, that is, to include new faces coming from the sector like Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes to liquid ERC once the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
It thus advocates the reform of the statutes to allow conventions to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsions placed the task of reviewing the assembly at a specific convention of status reform.
This meeting is still pending, as the internal tide in recent years has been advising against dealing with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors at the top, it can be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the one of three women and the finding of a pair of bodies surrounded in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, 390 deaths are reportedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Fathers Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearms and the graceful shot on his head as well as the feet and hands tied with cable.
The following day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the cabin of a abandoned vehicle on the Mixtecas street, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday morning, four Ejidatiers found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shootings in the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan Subway of the Sal, in the plot that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman, he was murdered with eight bullets after leaving his house to start garbage collection.
On the seventh of November, two 30-year-olds were finally hit by a bullet in each of them in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace on the front, a man's body was found on a lonely path of the Colonia El Naranjo and beneath the body found a shot of firearm 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Golondrina Beach colony.
Emergency bodies carried out a comprehensive search of the other members of the body, but were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán warned about the find of a corpse found in the Peña Colorado parade, which was tied from hand to back and with the sold head.
The man had a gunshot wound on his nose.
In half a month, the execution of two men, who were wrapped in cobias and abandoned in the cabin of a vehicle on the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda fractionation in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, was reported, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony was found wrapped in a bag of black plastic the rest of the body with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in cobias, two women were found lifeless in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow cobia with blue, allegedly identified with the name Mario Rios according to a message that his executioners left with him.
In Ixtapaluca, with firearms shot in the nude, a woman's lifeless body was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
In the woman's skin, tattoos of the Holy Death were detected, as well as glued with her image.
In the last part of the month, a man's body was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their head pregnant and a message were found in the community of Bridge de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who are not aligned."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found inside a cab abandoned behind the San Agustín colony's Centre of Justice with signs of torture and attachment of feet and hands.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them was decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape channel and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag on the streets of the Juárez Colonia.
Along with him, the agents found a postcard with a message.
Maintains China's objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of that country in COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supported its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), His Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert to his industry.
In fact, he explained that his country had invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
However, it was clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work with the international community in that regard.
It noted that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the adoption, last year, of a new Energy Act, which sets out the targets set for the reduction of gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with states and locals to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, it was abundant, it was already underway, or it had already completed several multiannual plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (United Nations), the Government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the changing of incandescent focusses by savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the Government of that country on climate change, ensured that China's efforts had been greater than they generally thought.
For example, the emissions per capita of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, as a 20% increase in energy efficiency over the past five years and plans to do so much more by 2020.
Sustained to the Legality Exclusion of Espino: Caesar Nava
The national leader of the PAN said that the former Panista leader was entitled to come to the National Order Commission to claim what was appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, ensured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was committed to the rule of law and that the former Panista leader was entitled to come to the National Order Commission to claim what was appropriate to his right.
In a previous interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudo as the governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken in the local area.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to refer, where appropriate, to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he made it clear that it was not time to think in 2012 and that he had never been at the negotiating table an alliance for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action would come out of the internal election of 4 and 5 December, in which he would have to elect his successor.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN supported it for 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; we "reuse it and strengthen it", he said.
He said that the council would no doubt be able to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, from there he will deliver the "who the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquillity and openness, and any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the party's response in the past elections of 4 July will be reflected in the next contents, although "it is not yet time to think in 2012."
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause for observation throughout the country, so that "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms to President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of the four years of his government, César Nava called on the pristines to reflect on the sexes of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of the closette," he said.
He believed that the owner of the Federal Executive could make such expressions as he had made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there was no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Promotion of Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined national mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
Its short message remains open a cyber link with a broader document that requests the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he said.
The message was released after the 42 republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of taxes from the Bush era and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade to the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a calendar could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement at some point at that time and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a "conclusion vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from the next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize some 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and have joined a higher education institution or the army.
But the supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, at a time when party organizations of the project are protagonizing an intense calibration to ensure the approval of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
Therefore, the supporters of the Dream Act require that several Republicans be added if other Democrats decide to back up the initiative.
Among the most honest Republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator George Lemieux, of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but have declared that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature put their finger on the lake
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where participants galvanized the narrative
"That's sex in the language I understand but... the finger in the lake? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was invited to open the second round of the Language Pleasures, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table devoted to Sex in the language, explained).
The finger in the lake... "puts us in a hurry", the Argentine writer eagerly awaited the public, mostly young, who was quoted at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to hear this moderate round table by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who is seeking to know what the "lag" is, goes from doctor to doctor, who doesn't get answers although they do track in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist he goes out with the conviction: "patience is not my strength, perhaps it's my lague."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the hall, but whoever makes it clear to him that the laga is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the laga is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the lake only to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very interviewed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative entitled Praise for the invention, where the finger in the lake is not appointed but is discovered in a moment.
With brushes of magical realism, a famous witch, who played the same with clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a maid had lost, a narrative that came to speak later America, the great novel that he did not miss from the beginning his own chroniclers who had told it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo as criticizing the excess of the story by the conquerors.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise he would never have come to tell the story of America with the imagination that he missed until the smell."
However, he pointed out that "the crazy and the better-imagined embusters are the ones" and that is where he convergences reality and lies, where it is no longer known that the story belongs to one group or another, where fiction literature reaches its climax.
It's actually called the "cervantine tradition."
"For your inheritance we are what is said."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero embraced and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger in the lake.
The Cuban-Puertorician pointed its way towards the great league of social violence that passes through its country - and shares Latin America - product of drug trafficking and sale disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs include a tactical commitment that of course is not premedied," he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also emphasized "that finger in the book of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in the intellectual habits and control of the consciousnesss that give rise to dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each assertion there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes."
"To be the owner of our thought and to be the owner of reality, we have to mate: and mating often means putting our finger on the lague and harassing those who are much more comfortable thinking in cartoon, in white and black, in established and unmatched ideas and also harassing the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three victories in the end, has had high scores in his career, but has been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three victories in the end, has had high scores in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although it has so far gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up condolences with the medal of the sub champion, has remained a step behind the winners, and curiously with the same team has played consecutive endings.
The holy strategy reached its first final as coach at the Open 2002 Tournament, when it carried the Morelia rings with which it fell across from 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the 2003 Clausura it also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a total of 3-1 and was precisely before Rayados.
With Santos Laguna, at the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, Rubén again faced the Devils, again suffering a reversal, since his team ended up 2-2 in front of the choricists after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty gang he took advantage of 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three of his players failed since the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 volleyball.
Rubén has already lost two endings with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his in turn rival, so he does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the evil and can celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an affair that I owe myself, and as a result the title will come to me, but the above is the most important," said the Timonel when asked about the numbers he has against playing finals.
The very current has the previous end, of which, he assures, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the end of the silver arbitrator we can't celebrate, we are ready on the ray, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties for shooting we were already ready to go out running and I think that's a teaching, until the party is finished we can celebrate."
To know that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that doesn't bother you, because it trusts its players: "You never try to get to the crime scene, you try to finish at regular times, but sometimes you don't have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately it made us a bad game, sometimes because of the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but if it went away, that left us something for this end that we hope not to come to that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-chamber technician and to try the glory of the titles for the first time.
EU changes rules for obtaining visas
People should visit Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower as well as the waiting time.
From 10 January 2011, the procedure for processing a visa in the United States Embassy and consulate will be changed.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) for their English stamps before their interview in the Consular Section.
The staff of the ASC will receive the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer will it be necessary to make a payment to conclude the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and more so that the message service deliver the document.
The vacuum cleaner will make only one single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petitioned visas (including temporary workers ' visas) and $390 for traders and investors ' visas.
People wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain at less than in the past.
Similarly, applicants for visas in the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the extra $26 service fee.

NASA will announce extraterrestrial life find
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow with a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is an extraterrestrial life.
The finding will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the person responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting to the press, NASA assured that it would present "a finding that would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures in our pair and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbial that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way of survival and of this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benign atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know".
The space agency will announce the true reach of the findings at the press conference on Thursday morning.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life in Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon in Saturn), in the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence & Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Act of Congress, resulting in the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they complain.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged at Congress, led by PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the 'bipartism' to the Chamber.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, starting with 'bipartisanism', because now there will be two people, the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau of Directors, led by the Panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they would talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they did not have it, then they would be again beaten by both parties and the opposition coalition ended.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, not even have the political distinction to consider the rest of the opinion."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Pattern, there are coincidences and are therefore forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolies, is now "double-polic".
"It is not the spirit to reform the law that has an eternal biopathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other partners and partners to make them more, the convergence was abundant.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress was currently becoming a 'brown' between two, as an allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was only a party, now they're dividing it between two."
Mr Montalvo, asked for respect for the personality of the Member, was given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by collective agreements, it is left out to 5 that we are probably going to make 9 Members, save the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unite ourselves to find a place at the negotiating table, that is the subject that in the reform that they made they agreed, we are outside and we do not agree with that reform."
Saluting $200 grand more for "the supplier"
Pay Mazatlán City Council other check to the questioned owner of electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200 thousand pounds for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was sent by the Town Hall.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pounds.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16th, by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts for payment".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had announced that he would make more money out of the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State's Higher Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that still owes you and, therefore, how many more checks are still missing for shipping in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you're just paying what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as is the case with the Act when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to prevent other Governments from using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not reused its services.
The previous, after 25 July, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the Municipality to its suppliers, which revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, in the Trienium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pounds, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he paid cheques for over 3 million pounds.
Emergency service for tourist sites
Tourist businessmen are sorry for the accident of a foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glory Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to give attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced the image of the destination and reversed the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come by and see the mess and take him back to the nearby business.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business one day and have no idea of the money they lose, or otherwise they don't do the works in time and without proper planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Town Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid going through it again, how to do so by providing preventive maintenance and not just falling into correction," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area should be maintained, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the Town Hall must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other places that also light neglected and incomplete, he said, like the Escudo and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, in order for the tourist to come not only depends on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance as regards tourist attractions," he said.
"It has not been given due attention and this kind of fact highlights something that is known for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said it is urgent to rescue tourist sites from Mazatlán, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city daily, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Luckily Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote to the destination."
Requests IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing better Sinaloa through the various challenges facing him.
A decent and free labour legislation between parties and the State Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsive Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature has been installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PAN members, 13 PAN members, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one of the other of the VAT, with a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they will come into clean management and commitment with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that do not repeat the same patterns of partisanism or paternism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the recent foreign representatives of the Congress of the State assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa through the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival appearances of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why he said that they would certify their commitment to establish the necessary bridges that led to the Governor in turn.
"We are busy doing a decent job, especially committed to society and sectors, because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces to seek the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will in some way encourage job generation."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators put the burden on him within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretary.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with a lower budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition to the need to label resources for detonating tourist projects and to assist in providing security to the state and updating the Alcohols Act that had not been able to resolve in previous legislations.
Can not get folder: %s: %s
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Crowna Valenzuela family.
For your parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please your illusions, as your home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a chive.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives today because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see her hard because my husband doesn't have a bed, but we sell mandarin and papa... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, aged 4, wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo, has long been a fan of a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayeta suggests a sized dress for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said to him, 'We're going to see a son', because he was very expensive,' he recalled with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, uses size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would be of much help.
If you want to help make the dream come true for the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign You are looking for a Mago King, giving a toy or effective in the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Austria, a decade of persecution has been carried out as part of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
Persecution has taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where drug production was carried out.
"Approximately 750 plants of Cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face Cannabis production charges, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests," says Mr. Ruel.
About seventy officers of the Sherbrooke Police Service, and the Memphremagog Police Department, were involved in this police operation.
It will be possible to fight illegal migration without problems
The draft law of conservatives, which the Government said should solve the problem of landowners charged with clandestine migrants, would certainly face a great opposition, since the three opposition parties had announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I am here with a party that has created the granite that you walk," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its present form, which would allow any person from a ship identified as transporting clandestine immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloque, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong white.
"We are against and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticism that her party is not strong enough with illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that measures are being taken against those in charge of clandestine landowners, and that is what we intend with another draft law, C-35," says Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and incarcerates children for at least one year," explains Mrs. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position to play politicians and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they don't tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal transactions against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a plepudo."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenny.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government will request a vote so that every opposition member will be explained later in front of his or her electors.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possibility of the establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and anti-corruption unit, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Research in New York has been a matter since January last year.
Metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement has taken more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services last 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
That was enough for the party's critic to remain concerned with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this ad as "a rabbit removed from the nest" and as "a scavenger solution of the last hour".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he just said.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is through Jean Charest's resignation," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead point, she suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the general spokesperson for carrying out an investigation into corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general spokesperson," he concluded.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling it to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent framework is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be made by the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is now inclined to make certain amendments to this issue.
During the spring 2001 operation related to the motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa encouraged the adoption of the Act on gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being monitored closely due to the severe precipitation recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon a plot of land took place in Shawnigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
During the night, another flow of land took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy precipitation, between 40 and 70 mm of rain.
In addition, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the snowfall that had already accumulated in certain sectors, several rivers are feared to overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Oueau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chen, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitation has caused some lakes to flood in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the flooding of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit is on the alert and monitoring of the immediate situation, according to Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Growth Prediction Centre, for its part, issued Wednesday ad announcing the strong growths of several rivers, including Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouereau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partly blame Dupont
Quebec Radio Presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain reversal before the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as for their gross language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, improperly negative representation of Haitians and gross language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, do not break the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front from persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Reporters must communicate reliable data rather than misleading data.
In connection with suicide, the submitted Stephen Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be considered a solution to the problems of life.
"Most of the Committee considers that the episodes submitted by "Dopont le medi" have dealt with a delicate topic in a fair and appropriate manner."
Consequently, any guilt has been settled in this regard.
The last dispute referred to statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Réné Dufort had staged a media confrontation that had caused many reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had made no donation to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure if the needed ones were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an improperly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of gross language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "including more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the issuer, which must, inter alia, announce the decisions once in the hours of the highest hearing within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Algerian manor Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who highlights in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, rises up to the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to move forward at the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur World Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San Shou in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished between the first four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is I've been making progress in every competition."
"To this step, I'll be the first time or next year!"
The "san show" or "sand" is a discipline from China in which it allows you to hit with your fists and feet, as well as throw your opponents to the ground.
The confrontations are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this kind of fight is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to maintain a competition in his career, he will certainly go to the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is China's most famous and prestigious," explains the cute boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's biggest stadium). "
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the end.
"What you've won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semi-final winners face at the end of their category."
"Then, the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
A consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor is located in the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts, which has obtained without prior tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy Management, was created in 2004 as a result of the decision by Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management consortium obtained the profitable contract without a prior public tender.
For the rest of the Party, the use of companies' consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause price rises.
"This is a new method of collusion and the elimination of competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it openly," Party MP Sylvain Simard said yesterday on a press wheel.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he said, he did not understand how public interest could be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, firmly denying that there was a confusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" and "with no rigour".
He pointed out that "minimum" would be that the PQ apologized.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, this is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a call for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devor published last week, the consortium formula in the technical advisory sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick view of Quebec's commercial registration allows for the identification of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Geneva, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that "the territory of Bahia James responds to a particular work dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s".
The chief of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has given an explanation that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
"If you respond to an invitation to tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact sector actors and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"The idea is, however, that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Energy Management consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Party.
Contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devor has identified 109 technical advice contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Geneva has achieved 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, regardless of its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
A total of $449,783,344, including the Energy Management Contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "known well-known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let it fall that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance it", before clarifying that it is more about their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire trust
More ecologically, but deeply sceptical.
Consumers are left with little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, as well as in fair trade marks and environmental certificates to guide their elections.
According to the Responsible Consumer Barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is submerged in a media universe where they pulsate messages that defend a more responsible consumer, but regret the lack of reliable information and consider that it even delays its commitment.
Even if the consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, the Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveal the measurement tool developed by the Observatory for Responsible Consumption at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates bearing the products called fair, as well as the credibility of the products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible", says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of the people in Quebec take seriously the speeches of politicians on this issue.
In any event, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about a third of the Chinese consumers.
In fact, the gaps and dubious nature of the information make it possible for 46 per cent of consumers to opt out of this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also say that they are not confident of the supposed performance of the products or environmental services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
61 per cent have prioritised purchases in their neighborhood shops and have preferred to buy food grown in their region, says Barometer.
More green and responsible (responsible consumption rate has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Quebec Homo consumus adores the position of the recycling king who is trying to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social consciousness seems to be from doors (from your car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecans indicated that they had used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and travel.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, whom they have requested to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus and Parallel Development Society, which expected a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois again the eXcentris cinema complex in the Boulevard of Saint-Laurent and give him back his true film vocation, did not get what they were asking.
The Government has accepted to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be lower than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first plan of action and an application of 12.8 million last spring, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Entrepreneurs (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, sent a proposal and a plan of action to Minister St-Pierre.
A final report was sent to him a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any event, it appears that the hypothesis of a State ' s donation should be completely discarded.
We recall that the Quebec Film Room Owners' Association and film complexes opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects as it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector are calling for considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the film, has carried the charge of the author for ten years in his complex premises, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films turns out to be patent in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to be faithful to his clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $70,000 to open the way to acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, has been projecting films in eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th, projecting the beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des men et des deiux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the low proposals they have received.
It lifts the veil of Canada complicated...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to the U.S., but at the same time reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-US relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy of Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday provide rather playful details that are really substantial.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, that is, during a full federal electoral campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This surprised the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins has given some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority that is practically inherent to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign), " he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador has even more problems understanding this "insidious silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"The ability of a candidate, a party and, moreover, the leader of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think when voting."
The cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, responsible for business in Ottawa, can also be seen to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure the government's survival during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will record deficits for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40,000 million," writes Mr. Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid replacing the coalition or that opposition parties had to condition their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington about the increasingly negative image that broadcast the drama series broadcast in the United States CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even to kidnappings for the CIA to carry out energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended "on every case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "has handed over a document to the State Secretary concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have been warmed up in connection with the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former counselor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's radio that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is made echo.
A Global Plan to Renewal of Lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GEI) to an amount nearly one third of the additional reduction that needs to be made to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is reflected in the whole of major concrete projects that the United Nations expects to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent pumps, which still monopolies between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluo-compact pumps or, better yet, electroluminescent diode pumps (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1,800 million tonnes of GEI (Gt) emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
The lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary automotive park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emission countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, an additional 5 Gt of this quantity should be reduced to stabilise, before 2020, the rise in temperatures in two centigrades to avoid being monitored.
In the incandescent pumps, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, that is, a 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluorinated pumps, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED pumps, energy consumption is reduced twice more.
The fluorinated pumps last between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED pumps, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent pump, allowing us to make an idea of the savings that could be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in one hundred countries.
These new pumps can also work with rehosts and emit very little heat.
Above, they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations regarding fluorinated pumps, since they contain mercury and should be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluo-compact pumps, but the coal thermal plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is poured out with the incandescent pumps.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits of this international programme to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save billions of dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Costa de Marfil looks forward to the announcement of electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the “immediate” publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results immediately," said a UN chief spokesman.
"Ask all the parties in Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline to pass from Wednesday to midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's poll.
About forty minutes before the deadline was over, the IEC president had commented on the television that the commission "was still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday the world has multiplied the requests that the IEC finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo gang has had the constitutional Council's cancellation of "fraud" votes in the north, in the hands of the former New Forces (UN) rebellion since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Costa de Marfil, said that the intimidation manoeuvres of UN voters in the north of the country had deterred followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged "unacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claimed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that he had filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the Presidents, on Sunday, should have led to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years.
The United Nations had warned the political class of Côte d'Ivoire on Wednesday that they could be considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round on 31 October with 38 per cent of the vote against 32 per cent of Alaskan Ouattara, which had received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the provisional seasonal variations (CVEs) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in continental France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the population active in continental territory and 9.7% with GMOs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has recorded an increase of 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they wished to work, whether or not they were available within the two weeks to work and seek employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in unemployment rate up to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including GMOs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older persons, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, an increase of 6.6% with GMOs.
Only a steady state of unemployment between the ages of 25 and 49 has been recorded, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Since 2006, the Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and has announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guerini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and the President-in-Office of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is under investigation and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guerini is being investigated for the abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue you through a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to demonstrate them," AFP had told her lawyer, Florence Rault, before her client appeared.
Mr. Guérini, a brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, has wanted to transmit a document to the judge through his lawyers before his appearance.
On Wednesday night, they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been to deal with the fields you have to manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, as legalist Simon says.
In the context of this file, he has also been investigated since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but has been released on parole and is forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The magistrate has taken account of the explanations and has let him go," explained his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night on Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as stated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of the property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking of influences and passive corruption".
Two officials from the accumulation of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned about "reduction and abuse of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and "complicated in the abuse of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "covering the abuse of social goods".
Among the persons who have faced Mr. Guérini are Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corcega.
Researchers suspect that their companies have a service to whitewash the capital of the great bandidism.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several court orders launched against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research indicates that the research focuses especially on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a miner in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Subject Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, Clotilde Reiss's fate, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", has been in the mood for the public in France, has warned diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the eyes of the U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own crisis of "rehenes" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by US justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram drawn up on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage seizures".
Eliseo's strategic affairs advisor, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held by force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "permanently release" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "incense", "immediate release".
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because once the attempts to negotiate by discreet channels are exhausted, "the silence won't solve anything", Iranians are "experts in dillatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day on which he will take refuge in the French Embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (EUR 230,000).
He also points out that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "is going to increase".
Iranians could "in the near future stop another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but remains locked up in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for the illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge ' s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine nuclear material acquisition networks, Majid Khakavand's incarceration is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Freeing Iranians in exchange for French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier made sure it wasn't like that.
Elisha, he said, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the judicial decision," he said.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French information services.
Eliseo's advisor marks a number of telephones, he reads and then tells the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, Eliseo did not spare any effort, using communications and "fugues" organized in the media to make it appear that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The U.S. observed this activity with certain irony and proved that manipulation brings its fruit, as several press articles transmitted the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is due to such "thank you" to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements of praise, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led to Elisha's laying on this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's opening policy towards Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, has just been struck by premature and unmistakable."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries to "show Syria the praise that it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seed of the discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows it from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusted him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, if we're grateful."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Elishao.
In a communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who have played an "active paper for the liberation of our compatriots".
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "Cenicient" that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family have indicated.
"Many children play all night and then it's hard for them to study at school and live a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, Minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, precisely.
The government also intends to ask companies that limit daily access time to these games when the parents of young people so request, the manager added.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests free computer software to limit Internet time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online games competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
Global 2018-2022: FIFA designates the host countries
In the midst of the storm caused by corruption suspicions, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the world Cup organizer countries of 2018 and 2022 on Thursday, a clearly political election where the struggles of influence and lobbying can come first on the technical criteria.
One thing is clear: the 2018 edition of FIFA competition will take place in Europe, traditional discipline stadium (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, since the International Federation hopes to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a foreign country on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of the Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a world.
Transactions between builders, therefore, may last until the last minute.
However, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to FIFA's assessment report, English, Hispano-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) applications have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of his country, with one of the footballers, who only hosted the World once in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the house on Monday by disseminating a documentary that has highlighted three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the responsible Englishmen, who have been throwing an intense lobbying over the past few weeks with David Cameron to the head.
The Head of Government looks forward to re-editing the hit successfully given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the JJ.O.O. 2012.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to restore England's brightness to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also has many strong points thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (Worldal of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Europe Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are all they can do is give points to Russia, converted into a weightier in spite of the gaps in its candidacy (stages, hotels, transport).
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced a "disloyal competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct allusion to the allegations of the English press against EC members.
"They're pulling out their dirty traps, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favorites.
First global economic power and headquarters of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to benefit Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk is the granting of the World 2026 to China, which is strongly desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to lose its chances for 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has submitted its project based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries are more at risk than you are sure of.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of TV rights paid by European countries (depending on the time difference), the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted it.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he had doubts.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less still.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of State will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that there is doubt.
Go one way and go the other way.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not reject a third term.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that you deal with UMP Members on Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has led to a certain revision.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president merely indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
I was just passing on the facts, not an ad.
It's not the first time he talks about the presidents, with a funny tone, in encounters like this.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," she had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I'm going to get what's coming next."
Your pre-trial claims do not come any closer to the candidacy, nor do they come closer to the candidate.
They raise comments for two reasons.
Accelerating the career by applying in the PS, on one side.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone to the gym what leads Nicolas Sarkozy to sincerity.
On the contrary, the fact that its candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people of the PS to claim that the battle will be organized before it is planned.
On the other hand, the bad probes.
For the first time, right voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the subject in the UMP," he has responded immediately and cautiously to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he thinks he can lose, he won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"You'll always think you can win," corrects Alain Juppe, relegated to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow the clarification of the exit arrangements for the crisis or at least the announcement of the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
As a result of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Emissions Institute can no doubt be so permanent that it does not want to risk exacerbating a situation that is more complicated today in European bond markets.
Political cost would be equal to high cost.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in the European States.
He did not want to say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."
The evening, in Brussels, during his hearing with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear more eloquent as regards his intentions, only indicating that the State's letter purchase programme in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" at the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will maintain its main variable type by 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's acquisition of treasury liabilities has doubled last week to about EUR 1,350 million.
In addition, according to the indirect operators of the market, yesterday it would have purchased Irish and Portuguese securities again.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have acquired securities for an amount of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the purchases will follow (see page 29).
Nor do economists foresee any significant change in direction.
Although lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, it still carries out unlimited liquidity allocations on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists hope that today this device will be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that I'm going to change your program considerably."
"If not, it would run the risk of creating new short-term tensions," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems most likely that a progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011 will take place," anticipates Norbert Brems, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these obligations in order to keep the market stable", adds Norbert Brems.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It should compensate any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the performances paid by the most fragile States," said an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if the types of interest are clouded, States will have even more problems reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government takes over the time
After Italy had begun the week in an alarming way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the recast of the rates of duty at 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economics, regional presidents have stated that they have heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indescribable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements subsequently denied by the interested party.
In any event, on Tuesday, the difference with the long-term German types had reached the record number of 210 basic points and the price of coverage contracts against the risk of failure (CRQ) had been fired up to 263 points, causing a certain revision in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "the disturbances in the markets" and possible contamination from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, causing the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have meant a cold water stream for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget currently under review in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% envisaged by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
From that point of view, the statement that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the parties, by an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures should be adopted," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
At present, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, both in the short and in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are smaller than those required by other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censorship motion in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In that case, a period would be unfavourable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms for combating the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, on the night and on the day, that the Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to the defence of their currency and their monetary area."
Although it was relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of obligations of European States has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Qualification Agency announced that it could lower the rating of Portugal's debt, the most frequent white in current speculations.
"As in May, there is really a lack of clarity and political transparency, which is a significant burden on banking systems," said the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "political pace is much slower than market pace".
Conscious of this holocaust and of the hidden dangers, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the mechanisms for exit from the already existing crisis.
Informal consultations between finance ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also takes into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market binder (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (FEF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched a trip to Singapore on Tuesday to Asia to inform investors in the Far East about the innovations of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, there is no doubt that land will be prepared.
The first EFSI securities issues are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative has entrusted the agency Reuters with the fact that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment by the IMF.
With regard to the countries in the first place, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are complemented by austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
Both wish to avoid requesting international assistance at all costs before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that they consider necessary to build lasting confidence.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are looking at the options available to speed up the process of standardising public debt markets.
In Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 75 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would have no doubt about re-drawing the wallet.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an additional EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently with EUR 6 billion.
A council that could, of course, examine European capital in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowflakes continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in alert orange due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already alerted to orange, eighteen from Wednesday to midnight, and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to the French weather, strong snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although also snowing slightly on the island of France.
A snow layer of between 2 and 5 cm is expected, with an accuracy of between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
Snowflakes are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, the French Weather Alert.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmeries, traffic in the UK secondary network is complicated, so they recommend that it be not driven unless necessary and that certain TER vehicles be prohibited during the day.
School transportation in Picardia has been banned during Thursday.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the traffic of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture " urges all drivers to drive with the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel 25 per cent of their flights on Thursday at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10 per cent at Orly due to planned snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airlines.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, South London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the island of France has reached its high point, there have been thousands of millions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion million for the Grand Paris metro that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In theoretical terms, this amount will then allow SGP to obtain market loans to finance part of its double cycle.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Correctional Finance Act, which was examined by the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the tools planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in figures: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on the offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and target this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows?
No figures are given in the text.
But it's away from 4 billion.
"The tax resources are required to be added to the EUR 4 billion of the state-mobilising allocation and to be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the time income is created (the two taxes, nndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The SGP estimates that it will start to receive the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This instrument, in which the promised 4 billion are not included in the credit, can cause a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it exposes an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound international changes and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's take a step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (depending on the nation to which it belongs) is formed exclusively by press cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long given cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule according to which secret files should only be formed by news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism do not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is pessimistic, just as he is pessimistic (or little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, what I know, editor of the Liberation), which only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that sent the US Embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same as it was published last week.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a revision?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State can be called by telephone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows it perfectly, we just pretend we don't know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of US diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world has a significant impact on the prestige of the Department of State.
The scandal, therefore, affects both victims and "vertigos".
But we enter into the true nature of what has happened.
In ancient times, in Orwell’s day, it could be conceived to all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true ever since, by controlling each movement through the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it turns out, as it happens now, that even the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and turns circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the revenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be sustained that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets meant to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and many, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury caused by such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to place any information on the network, as it would be like publishing it on a full-scale cartel.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, it is not possible to expect to maintain confidential conversations by telephone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has moved on board and has been contacted by one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the time being, my prediction is a science of fiction and therefore novelty, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly into diligences with uncontrollable routes, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, like many, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
This information is then preserved, in a single copy, in locked drawers with key: in order to account, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently progressing like a candle, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized the communications, the Internet has again created a telegraph with cables.
Video tapes (analogues) had allowed film researchers to study a step-by-step film, moving and going back, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to advance or go back from chapter in chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on a plane, with the displacements it carries, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing but normal that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly involved in the embassies.
At present, it is the ambassadors who are asking for confidential information to the press.
Climate: the caps of France in their financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked financing promises (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been met.
And the French caps have been exposed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $3 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has committed to EUR 7,200 million in three years and France EUR 1,260 million (i.e. 420 million a year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press wheel, a large complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparent operation was an appreciable result and was truly appreciated: developing countries and civil society wanted all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, there has been no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the most appropriate reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference in 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million in three years is added to fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with regard to the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), while it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no norm and each one chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, believe that each euro lent is equivalent to a given euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it turns out that a euro that is to be recovered is going to be equivalent to a euro that is given... As much as it should only be calculated for its commitments the cost of the loan to the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent to a type of interest).
But France does not find such reasoning helpful: "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million); see the EU document to see it for yourself.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among other things, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union gives a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only gives 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only €36.1 million, it can give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional" as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has been involved in arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States going to continue to give when they could simply lend?) and in the negotiations, as developing countries are not stupid...
The early financing chapter is a short-term one in relation to the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be a grain of more sand in the huge machinery that is the CNUC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with a view to respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could make the debate on long-term financing bets progress (another key chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore hope that the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive at Cancún next week.
A surprising announcement on the rapid start of France and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in negotiations.
Warning about child-ingested pesticides
A 10-year-old ingested 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Generations Futures Association (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that often consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a meal a day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as golosins, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or likely cancers and five are classified as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even though, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that may harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, is intended as a tent for the college, contains traces of six chemicals, including a prohibited fungicide in France.
The same applies to green Jews in Kenya, including in food, where the study has detected traces of a mighty insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian thread, the tuna in milk and even the bread bar or chicle were attached with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the graffiti, the analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
In the dinner, the salmon wheel was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these "pollutant cocktails" for the consumer is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The European Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "to address the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to prevent "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereals.
