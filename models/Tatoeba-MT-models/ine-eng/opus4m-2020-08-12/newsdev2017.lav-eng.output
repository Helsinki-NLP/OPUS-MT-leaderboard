New issues on the California Water Supply Project
Critics and state legislators say they want to know more about what they are paying for a $16 billion project supported by Governor Gerry Brown, following the California Water Supply Representative's statement that the Brown administration is offering government funding to complete two huge water tunnels.
Critics argue that the government's funding described by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Supply Administration may run counter to the state's long-standing claims that the various local water supply administrations, not California themselves, would pay for the Brown vision to extract two equal 35-yard long tunnels to water south of the Sacramento River, mainly Central and Southern California.
Initial expenditure on the construction of tunnels amounting to US$ 248 million, which is still to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already begun a federal audit investigation.
On Wednesday, state lawmakers also ordered a state audit of the construction costs of tunnels.
On Thursday, the mayor of the state, Nancy Vogel, said that, despite the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water Supply Management Account, no money would be used to complete the current planning phase of the two tunnels from the state's general budget.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the Assembly representative, Susan Ega, one of the state's statutory auditors ordered this week, asked the state on Thursday for explanations.
"It is a game of bribery," said David Wolfs, Legal Director of the taxpayers' association Howard Jervis.
In my opinion, this calls for a Tuesday audit (request): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water supply management and water consumers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide safer water supply to Californians.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the state will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sakramento River and the San Francisco Bay, harming Northern California and even endangering local species.
Metropolises and other water supply administrations intended to obtain water from tunnels still have to be committed to paying them for their insecurity as to whether massive investment will actually provide enough water for it to be repaid.
The same water supply authorities also announced this year that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project was first authorised by the supervisory authority.
On Thursday, the monthly report published by the Government of Los Angeles on the tunnel project states that "the state has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be granted from the state or federal budget."
After all that local water administrations have spent on the project, including US$63 million from their water supply administration, it is expected that the state will use national money to complete the planning," said Bob Moore, spokesperson for the Los Angeles water supply administration.
He then turned questions to Vogel, a state speaker.
Vogela said that the state plans to allocate money to complete the planning of the tunnels from the fee for the existing half-century old water network, the state water project.
The opponents of the construction of the tunnels, however, point to a regulatory framework issued in 2009, which they say prevents the state from spending money on the construction of the tunnels, until the water supply authorities which benefit from it are bound to pay for them.
"The project's contractors have promised to pay for this project and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these commitments," said Patrízia Šiferle, environmental consultant and former tunnel opponent.
This raises questions about where the money was suddenly found.
Addressing the Business Group on China's Cybersecurity Law
The coalition of international business groups has turned to China with a request to change the proposed cybersecurity rules by warning that they will harm trade and isolate the country.
The letter to the Chinese Prime Minister Li Kecjan has been signed by 46 groups from the USA, Europe, Asia and Latin America, expressing global concern that the rules could restrict or impede access to the Chinese information security product market.
The signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products operate and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter, dated Wednesday, said that it could make data theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical Explosion in Tianjin: Since Tragedy Last Year
Zhang Mengfan claims that the company has earned to know what happened in Tianjin.
China’s leaders plan quiet reminders to mention a large - scale chemical explosion that killed 173 people on the first day of the year, but not all agree.
John Sadwarts reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world would be the anniversary of such a global catastrophe as the people remember and remember.
Not in China, though.
Although a memorial service is kept in the city of Taijin for the memory of some of the deceased firefighters, elsewhere such memorial measures are excluded.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors and family members are warned not to speak to the foreign press.
However, 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan doesn't want to shut up.
"This year's society should know something about what happened," he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On 12 August last year, Zhang was a radio operator in the military fire brigade, which was only a mile away from the explosion epicenter.
"The call was received this evening at 22.53, and we started sending my team members," he says.
They could arrive at the event site within 10 minutes.
The disposal of large chemical fires in the warehouse also rushed teams from other places of the city.
None of them drew attention to the fact that a large number of volatile and toxic substances were illegally stored in excess of the permitted quantities and without proper monitoring.
Fire started when nitrocellulose - the chemical that can be used in nail polish - was allowed to disappear and the party then sweated the fires in the summer.
It then spread in a vast area - 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
The explosions had windows and a fire department where Zhangs Mengfan was waiting for radio station news from the scene, and the roof was attacked.
This information was not received either.
"When I saw the magic of the swine, I fell into despair," he tells me.
I knew what that meant to my friends.
Of the 26 firefighters of his unit, who were sent to the blast site, eight never returned.
Many others have suffered severe burns and other injuries.
The largest of the two major explosions was similar to the earthquake, and the explosion wave was felt many miles away.
The total loss is estimated at more than US$ 1 billion, including more than 300 collapsed buildings.
In general, 173 people were killed, 104 of whom were firefighters.
The fatal waste of eight people was also not found.
The investigating authorities of the official government are clearly guilty of corruption, political communications and official secrecy, which led to circumvention of the rules and the ignoring of security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse should never have been built close to home.
More than 100 officials and company management representatives have been involved in some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, as long as the government can point out the progress made - thousands of homes and compensations for citizens - these sensitive issues remain relevant.
The tragedy has been discovered in a fragile system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
His evening courage and sense of duty are beyond doubt, yet without a fire extinguisher as a picture of a hero, a pleasant scene will not open.
It contains a firefighter as a victim who was sent without warning to fight a man - made disaster that could be prevented.
Zhangs Mengfan no longer works in the fire department, but will visit the memorial service in Tianjin.
He will convey to his heart the message of his loved ones who have died.
Most of all, I want to say to them, I've visited your parents and they're looking good.
Leave your parents to me.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I will fulfill your duties as a son.
The cold spring could affect the Scotch edge shooting season
The shootout season in Scotland will start later, as the number of birds this year has fallen because of the cold weather.
In many properties, shooting is delayed because many of the new rubles have not survived in cold spring conditions.
Marking the start of the season, the Scottish Gambling Association (SGA) reported that shooting the rubble provides more work than the Edinburgh Festival.
However, the OneKind Animal Welfare Fund calls for the end of "brutal killing of birds".
The director of the organisation, Harry Hutton, said: "The work that is invested in the provision of large numbers of games intended to shoot birds is huge and inevitably involves all the controversial activities."
There is no surprise that society is avoiding this so-called sport and calls on the government to ban the cruel, unnecessary work enjoyed by only a very small part of the people of Scotland.
The landowners both insist that they undertake to keep the number of birds and that the shooting of rubble is important for the development of the rural economy.
SGA President Alex Hogs said that the sector provides 8 800 full-time jobs per year in the outermost regions and that it has been "rich in employment" in uncertain times.
He said: "In comparison with many European countries, there is not so much a culture of "hunting" in Scotland, and some people do not know how the shooting season affects the country in terms of the economy."
Hogs said that the number of jobs provided during the shooting exceeded the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, the Fringe Festival, the tattoo festival and the Vecgad Evening Festival together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is currently very worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game managers and their families want to see a rise in the sector.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hard-working people can also rely on these jobs in the future.
RSPB Scotland believes that at least eight golden eagles have been killed in the vicinity of the rubble.
Many game managers acknowledge that shooting rubies is not popular in general, but SGA claims that the sector has "successful steps forward in terms of best practice".
Traditionally, the day of the shooting season is known as "the Holy Twelve."
However, there is still much discussion about this type of sport, and the management of rubble shooting sites is linked to the persecution of some of the perpetrators by the nature conservation authorities.
On Thursday, the RSPB Scotland said that over less than five years in the mountains of Monadliata, south-east of Invernes, eight gold eagles were lost.
The Natural Welfare Fund considers that they are illegally killed near the point of shooting of the rubble and that their satellite apse has been destroyed.
Scottish Environment Minister Rosanna Kaningema said that these reports are "very disturbing and regrettable."
Ms Kaningemas asked officials to analyse the evidence for about 90 survivors and missing eagles with transmitters to determine whether there was a trend in criminal activities.
The Scottish cleaning group blames the RSPB for attempts to raise counter-shooting feelings before the beginning of the rubble season, and also stated that there is no clear evidence that the birds had even been killed in the vicinity of the Monadlita Mountains.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Briony Peedja Great Britain shines silver in the trampline
Representative of the United Kingdom to Peedja for the silver trampline
Briony Peedge became the first British woman to come to the Olympics in the trampline game, Rio turning silver.
Peedži (25) to the gold was missing 0.425 points, as Canada's representative Rosanna McLenana had already awarded the second Olympic title in turn with a result of 56,465.
The world champion, China’s representative Lee Dana, was at the bronze, while the second British finalist, Katrina Driscola, finished in sixth.
I can't believe I beat the Olympics.
I'm so happy," clearly said emotional Paige.
I didn’t think it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the training and hard work had returned.
I am so happy that I was able to start at the end with Ketu, and the participation of one representative at the end would be historic, but there were two of us there.
The highest achievement in the international competition before the 2015 World Cup in Denmark was the fifth place before the Olympics.
The tram line hit in the Olympics was included in 2000, and this is the first time British women have managed to get to the finish.
Reaction to the medal.
The British team’s representative Nathan Beelis, the only representative of men in the competition for trampline strikes on Saturday, was in ecstasy.
Hanna Velana, who has been in the Olympics for the second time, quickly began to celebrate Paige’s achievement.
Peedja has obtained a bachelor's degree in biology with excellence at the University of Chefild.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate gold medal in regbia-7
12-year-old boy to watch the game, take half of the juices and sugarcane fields to the nearest TV
Fiji, after its history, begins the first Olympic gold medal to begin with an unforeseeable celebration
Banks closed, shops fasted and celebration took over Suva streets, dancing, singing and licking
Fiji won a gold medal at the Deodoro Stadium at Regbia-7 at the end of 43-7, smashing Britain.
Thousands of people throughout the island stopped their usual work to watch the historic game.
Fiji's Celebration of the First Olympic Medal in History
Many fellow believers were dressed in Fiji’s colors and were wearing a national flag and encouraging the team.
When the games were played at the end of the swing, the excited celebrants went to the streets, bending and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles in the streets of Suva in the streets of the people and joined the Fiji flags to celebrate, not to focus on the small tensions they have created," says Fiji Times.
The flowers will definitely continue at the end of the week and next week.
Irish Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron Makeefs has committed two first half-time sentences for the guest team in Finnpark.
Derry City has risen to the second Prime Minister, winning a convincing victory with a result of 5-0 in the fight with Finn Harps.
Aaron Makeefs put forward a "confection strip" under the direction of successfully carrying out two first half-time sentences that were awarded for violations against Lucas Schubert.
Nathan Boil entered the doors at the beginning of the second half of the time, and Schübert defeated the opponent in the fourth quarter before Kitt Vard's late play, closing the opponent's pit in Finnpark.
Derry is one point ahead of Cork City, and both teams will meet in the crucial game on Monday evening in Brendavel.
It was Derry's first victory over his North-West competitors this season, and they disturbed me on the Harps side.
Makenef saved the game opening site in 17 minutes after Kiran Kola went out against Sübert, although the crime turned out outside of the punishment.
There was no doubt about the second execution site, the former "Caramel Strip" half-guard of Bari Molo, leaving Schubert to fall to the ground and Makenefe to achieve the result in the third minute after the break.
Boil added the exact point after the Dina Jervis play with the foot within the eighth minute after the game was resumed.
Derry City was a peaceful evening for Warden Gerard Doherti, but he managed to protect the gates perfectly, defeating David Skalley's guests in the best discovery of the game.
Sübert took the bomb for a long time before Colam was released in 83 minutes, followed by Varda's wise retreat over the Harps Centre of Protection Richard Brass.
It was Derry's biggest win in the series and excellent preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test after mass undisclosed tests at the University of Upper and Isles University (UHI) of Inverness
All 20 students could be expelled from Inverness College in the UHI higher media course exam.
Most of them were 17 - and 18 - year - olds who hoped to use the notes received in the studies to attend the university.
Inverness College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) investigates these cases.
The SQA press secretary said that the country-wide highest media assessment available in 2016 was "as planned".
Twenty students enrolled in the UHI offered and evaluated course of Inverness College.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who were learning online, but they often had to go to Inverness College from their homes, such as Locheibera.
One student’s father said that after his daughter’s publications in the social media that she had not received any evaluation for her work, at least 10 also reported that she had not received any evaluation for her course work.
He told BBC News Scotland online that about five more people who won this course at Inverness College last year and who managed to contact said the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot provide a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to accept another offer from the university through the qualifications obtained at school.
However, her father said that there were also others who attended the college-organized media course that had not taken place and who were now in "forgettable" and uncertain whether their course would be reviewed and evaluated with notice so that they could enter universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Upper Stairs and Islands.
Diāna Rovlinson, Head of UHI of Inverness College and Executive Director, said: "The results of our exams and students' achievements are very important."
This is also demonstrated by the excellent report of the Her Majesty’s Education Inspectorate (HMIE) received this year, as well as by the improved levels of achievement in both further and higher education compared to last year’s.
As we have done every year, we are reviewing all the published results, comparing them to those predicted for each student.
In this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were carried out and the assessment body recently reported on "essential improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "evaluations were in line with national standards".
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
The SQA Press Secretary said: "We are pleased that 2016's top media evaluation has taken place as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there was a slight increase in the A-C performance rate compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and assessment specifications.
Brothers in prison for the samurai sword "drinked" in Kilmarnok
Jason Bryden was attacked with samurai's sword, Nazi and nun
Two brothers were imprisoned for killing a man with a samurai sword after drug-related theft in Airshire, which was described as "intoxicating".
Victim Jason Breiden (38) was visited several times in his home in Kilmarnok on 5 July 2015.
The Supreme Court in Glasgow, James Clarke (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison for murder.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years in prison after a less serious charge of murder without prior notice.
In bringing the two men to prison, Judge Bill Danlops told the brothers that they had made a "unfortunate, hard-hearted and savage attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Bridena had fallen asleep and waited for them to arm himself with a samurai sword.
Judge Danlops added: "You are planning an illegal entry together with at least one Nazi and Ninja."
Jason Braden may also have been a drug addict, but he was a son, a father, and a friend.
You killed him.
After both men were imprisoned, the police inspector who conducted the investigation said: "John and James Clarke's violent and horrendous actions have resulted in Jason Braden's death."
Go to the sun at 38 years of age and under such terrible conditions are the heart condition that the family needs to survive.
The court had heard earlier that the brothers in Kilmarnoca had decided to rob Mr. Briden of the gold they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both of them went to his house in an alcohol - and - drug attack, masked their faces with scarves, and armed with knives and Eastern combat nipples.
It is considered that the sword used in the murder belonged to the deceased.
The neighbors said that they saw Clarke's attack on Braden when he sat on a couch next to the window and heard his cry.
Prosecutor Richard Godards at the court hearing said, "The assault on this man was sustained, chaotic."
Then the place of the murder was described as "blooded".
In addition to the wounds from the knife holes, Braiden was severely traumatized during the attack with a rotary object.
Three days later he died at Kilmarnokas Kroshaus Hospital.
Both brothers did not confess to murder.
Giving evidence, James Clark, who had been tried 38 times before, including a murder attempt, said, "I didn't want it.
John Clark, who has already been tried 23 times, said that he was only involved in helping a brother who, according to him, had attacked Bryden."
A man is sentenced to imprisonment for cuddling and killing his child’s son
David Sinclair admitted his guilt at the murder of a child in his home in the Middle East in 2012.
A man who was beaten and killed by the rage of his babies because he did not want to eat was sentenced to seven years and three months of imprisonment.
David Sinclair spent four months at the age of Joshua when he "lost control at the moment" at his home in East Kilkilbraid, South Lancashire, on December 6, 2012.
The cause of death was found only after judicial expertise.
Sinclair (34) was initially accused of murder but was found guilty of murder without prior notice.
In the Supreme Court of Glasgow, when he was sentenced to prison, Judge Lord Briesidls Sinclair said: "You attack your child's son by scratching him, causing the injuries from which he died."
When you caught him, you had to know that, but you didn't.
Only after thorough medical examinations you will recognize what you have done.
Your wife believed you.
Now her feelings are transferred and you can no longer be supported.
Lord Braceidl described the consequences of Joshua's death as "catastrophes" for everyone and added, "Nothing will ever return to Joshua."
The court had previously found that on the day of the child’s death, Sinclair and his wife, Kyrgyz, went to swim with Joshua and to buy some real money.
At 5:30 p.m., Kerstija Sinclaire went to see her mother and sister.
Only 11 minutes later she was called by Sinclair, who heard "shocked".
He said to her, "Joshua doesn't breathe like he does, even coming home immediately."
Then he finished the conversation and called 999.
The infant was immediately taken to Hermira’s hospital, where he died.
Initially, the cause of Joshua’s death was unclear, but he was examined by a judicial team of medical experts who found the consequences of the injuries in the eyes and brains just before death, and such injuries could not be randomized.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richards, a neurosurgeon at the John Redcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said: "It's because the child has been hit and thus has been injured, as well as arrested with more force than in the day."
The representative of the defense told the court that Sinclair "extremely regrets" what he had done.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Hloja Tatone threatens the positions of July Jefimova
For the British representative Tatoni, out of hands bronze in a 200 m swimming
The UK representative of Holya Tatone criticises the participation of the opposing swimmer Julia Jefimova in Rio after being shocked by the Russian representative in the 200 m swimming.
Jefimova, who was allowed to take part in the games following the complaint against participation in the doping ban, was struck with silver leaving Tatoni in the fourth place.
"I would have wanted them to be completely clean games," said 20-year-old Welsh swimmer.
I haven't decided who's in there.
I'm not satisfied with that, but that's what it is.
Jefimova, who played the second place, learned about his participation in the games only three days ago.
I don't want to see how people get out of sports, but I don't think it's really right.
She did not have to compete, and the 20 - year - old British representative had to pay a medal.
Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal in 2016 in Rio, defeating Jefimov, who was at the silver medal.
China's representative Jinling This was at the bronze, just six hundred seconds ahead of the fourth remaining tattoo.
Her British teammate, 20 - year - old Molly Renšova, ended up in six.
"Remaining in the fourth place is a little bit of a disappointment, no matter what you have in front of you," Tatone added.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little confused about fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and it would have been a dream.
However, the final meeting itself is an excellent experience that I will take with me in the years to come.
It was a bit of a disappointment, but in the long run it will make me strong, and it will make me ever closer to the medal, so hopefully the next time I get closer to it.
Tatone just 0.01 seconds from the British record at the end of the 200 m swim.
"Every man must give another opportunity," - Jefimova.
Jefimova, who said that she was already tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was banned for 16 months after her body was found to have an anabolic steroid.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) found that athletes cannot be prevented from participating in the Rio Games because they already have sanctions.
The CAS examined my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and has a different opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it was definitely not my fault.
Each person must give another opportunity.
When you go and get a sentence receipt, no one's gonna put you in jail.
Ben Praudt is a place for 50 free-style swimming
A British record was previously installed to clear the room of men at the end of the 50 m free-style swimming.
The distance of the Union champion Prauds (21) dived in 21,54 seconds to the fifth fastest qualified Friday finals (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is harmless and rude
Indian Sports Minister Vijajs Goels Rio has been a very attractive person in the Olympic Games, often manned in the Tribes, encouraged Indian athletes and taken by themselves after their start.
However, he and his large company have apparently caused the Olympics organizers ’ anger for their uncontrollable behavior, repeatedly trying to break out to the competition areas without adequate accreditation and abruptly reacting to the tests, reports the Indian News Agency Press Trust of India.
Vijay Goels, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
On Wednesday, the Olympics organizers threatened to cancel Goel’s accreditation if his behavior would not improve by sending a warning message after he and his company tried to enter restricted access areas to the event venue and arena where the gathering and the talk took place.
"We have received a number of reports that your sports minister has tried to enter the accredited competition areas with people who do not have accreditation," says Sara Peterson, the continental manager of the Rio 2016 organizer committee.
When the staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, the people who were with the minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes broke away along with our staff.
"If our protocol team is aware of any other cases of such behaviour, your sports minister's accreditation will be cancelled and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be cancelled," the letter continued.
The leader of the Indian delegation called the case "from the fly's tail", and Goels himself said he had done nothing wrong by writing it all down as "understand".
On Twitter he wrote: "As far as I know, we have observed all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, although India has a lot of drums for this Olympic game, there are currently no medals.
Desperate fans in the social media pointed out that Michael Felps has scored as many medals - 26 - as India has in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won the gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he's left the fourth.
Money and opportunity is being launched," author and column author Shoba De, Sardinian tweeted.
However, there are still some bright hopes, as there will still be competitions in the boxing, golf, tennis, light athletics and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian winner, Dipa Karmakara, will make the finals of the jumps on Sunday, showing his terrible double turn "Death" of the Produn's jump, which only a few other winners have tried.
In the country where 1.25 billion people live, India’s low number of gold medals has always been a cause of shock.
Analysts say it has countless reasons.
National anger is a cricket that is not an Olympic sport.
India has not made a significant contribution to infrastructure and Olympic training - Karmakara's first roundup tool was made from the spare parts of the old scooter.
Parents have always stressed the academic advantage of knowledge about sport.
And the authorities responsible for sports are taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has deposited the Indian Olympic Association on its statutes in 2012, as it has elected leaders against whom criminal cases are proposed.
In Sočos, three Indian Winter Olympics were even prevented from representing their country, carrying a flag, or wearing any national symbol.
They come together as independent athletes.
When people get hurt, the turbulence jet Blue aircraft route in Boston-Sakramento is forced to drop off in South Dakota.
The JetBlue aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing on Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during the turbulence, CBS Sakramento reports.
A trip of 429 from Boston to Sacramento will take place in Rapidsity, South Dakota, just before 19:30 p.m. after local time.
The airline reported that the injured were transferred to the hospital for inspection.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to assist the injured, has fled to Rapidsitia to reserve aircraft to deliver the other passengers to Sacramento.
Drug Control Agency (DEA) launches long-term options for medical marijuana
Unfortunately, the answer is: it is unlikely.
This is a loss of opportunity that may cause even more delays in the provision of treatment to countless people.
To date, only one source of medical marijuana has been approved at the federal level for scientific purposes at Mississippi University.
Apparently a little bit more positive today, the DEA also announced that it would now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
There is hope that the extent and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes can be expanded.
Although it will draw attention to the benefit of the study, it will be largely symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access to it is still difficult, it does not matter.
Imagine a product that is very requested but is kept behind closed doors.
In response to the demand for the goods, which makes it difficult to understand the decision to produce it more, but to be and it never unlocks the door.
This product is marijuana and is listed in Schedule 1 as this closed door.
Medical marijuana is in such an uncomfortable situation.
Since marijuana is a substance included in list 1 (respectively, according to its definition "no medical use currently approved and there is a high potential for unexpected uses of it"), there are significant barriers to the unlocking of the doors.
Potential researchers usually focus on DEA because it gives permission to start scientific studies.
Even if an authorisation is granted for the examination of substances included in list 1, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and establish high-level safety systems that may be costly.
There is also the most subjective consideration of obtaining authorisation from its academic authority to carry out studies of substances included in list 1.
Even if individual faculty representatives want to do this study, the management of the university may not want problems or any potential side effects due to negative press reports.
This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was discharged from the post of the attempt to advance medical marijuana trials.
Eventually, Sisli had to seek private funding for her project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was proposed, her project became the first approved DEA medical marijuana attempt to prevent post-traumatic stress for the veterans.
After years of struggle with bureaucratic barriers, the National Drug Addiction Institute has been at the end of the last lockdown.
He is currently the largest federal funding provider of marijuana research and is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if a higher amount of medical medicine is available for free circulation, the Institute will still need to approve all the studies financed by it.
The problem, however, is the word "use of abuse" in its name.
Dr. Donald Eibram, representative of Sanfranski University, interviewed his documentary film "Marihuana", says that the main task of the institute is to study substances in the context of their potential dependence, not as medications.
Ebrams draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all of the obstacles listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to investigate the benefits of medical marijuana rather than its damage.
Note: In a quick (and, to be recognized, non-scientific) search, 1,434 works were found in the U.S. National Library of Medicine during the last five years.
In the same search, only 57 works were for the benefit of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about the damage suffered by marijuana, such as "Bad travel due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "pancreatitis caused by marijuana" and "the use of marijuana and the risk of lung cancer."
Such a disproportion creates a completely distorted view.
The way to the use of medical marijuana is confused with surprises and surprises wherever the sight is opened.
While the DEA covers the status of List 1 without regard to the medical effect, the US Department of Health and Social Affairs simultaneously maintains a wide range of cananbionic patents for medical purposes.
DEA continues to identify marijuana with heroin and LSD as a drug with the potential to create high dependence, although DEA itself was the main administrative judge, Francis Yangs, against it.
Strictly medically speaking, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, 10 fresh potatoes may cause toxic reactions.
Compared to this, it is physically impossible to eat so many marijuana in order to stop death.
Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeuticly active substances known to humans.
In a rational analysis, marijuana can be safely used as a treatment under appropriate supervision.
Again, it must be said that it was proposed by the DEA judge himself.
And yet, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we realize it or not, all of us accept certain doses in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to say it loud or we're either so stupid or stupid that nobody seems to have noticed it.
As far as wetness is concerned in the context of the Federal Medical Marijuana policy, it is necessary to have the stamina to present the facts in an undisputed manner.
Patients’ lives, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose seizures are reduced by medical marijuana, and many other lives depend on it.
The fact that the plant can do so much good and is still behind closed doors is worth talking about at the highest level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donalds Tramps "Blondais Berlusconi"
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
The musicians say the tramps dominate the media like Berlusconi
You know, we've been to Berlusconi in Italy, and Tramps looks like a blonde Berlusconi," the founder of the electronic music band "The Bloody Beetroots" said CNN.
The candidate for the office of President of Republicans and the political magnet of the Italian media, both known to his over-played personalities, the ability to attract press attention and the media of changed stories.
In the composition of "Bloody Beetroots", Rifo is familiar with his electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, starting with legendary Seru Polo Makartni and ending with electropop singer Greta Svabo Beču in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basan del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, which coincided with the time of Pancroc's birth, and the numbers "1977" were placed on the chest by a musician.
"The English language is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black fee he's known for.
I am trying to explore, and I am trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited Americans to watch "Videocracy", a documentary that examines the Berlusconi monopoly on Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made Italy crazy," Rifo said, adding that Trappam had a similar effect on America.
"You see how a man can completely turn the system and dispose of everything... by his own," he said.
I don't think Tramps is good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors are imprisoned in prison for more than 500 million pounds of drugs
Two Turkish men were sentenced to more than 500 million pounds of cocaine smuggling on board a ship in the North Sea, each sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Momins Sahins and Emins Ozmen were found guilty after the trial in the Supreme Court in Glasgow after about 100 miles from the coasts of Aberdina on the MV Hamal deck were found three tons of Class A drugs.
In 2015, detention is the largest single shipment of cocaine that has ever been detained in the sea in Europe.
Mamina Sahin and Eminam Ozmena were sentenced to prison for her role in a large-scale drug deal
A valuable drug cargo found on board is one of the biggest in British history
Narcotics were found hidden in a specially equipped hiding place on Tanzanian registered to sail from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British fleet frigate "HMS Somerset" and the border force quarter "HMC Valiant".
Sahins (47) was convicted for 22 years, but Ozmen (51) was sentenced to 20 years in the Glasgow Supreme Court.
Justice Lord Kinkleiven told men that the amount of drugs was not only "significant but ambitious", and the drug smuggling has a "depressive effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said: "You have been commercially involved in the most extensive operation, including the transport of cocaine by ship, in the operation that crossed international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said that Captain Sahins was not "in the end of the drug tree", but he had an important role to play in the crime, while the second Captain Ozmena was "killing to some extent less".
The inspectors climbed the Hamal deck after the introduction of information from the French customs office DNRED, and when it arrived in Aberden, they went through the steel plate, accessing the secret compartment, where 128 links were found with cocaine weighing 3.2 tonnes, as the approximate value in the black market is 512 million pounds.
Last year, "MV Hamal" was checked by the royal fleet.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
During the inspection of the vessel, it was found that its ballast tanks contain tons of Class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the Strait of the Bosporus to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this place was opened under the cabinet in one of the crew’s rooms, and the hole was cemented.
Sahins and Ozmen were found guilty of the transport and hiding of cocaine on board from 20 February to 23 April and of the supply of cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
The two uncondemned men who have worked in the shipping industry since the end of the school continue to claim that it is not wrong, however, to take the oath.
There is no evidence to support the charges against four other men.
Sahina's lawyer, Jonathan Crowd, said that a married father of two children is a "glorified mule".
He said, "Someone involved in the transport of drugs."
Someone who was able to run the ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahins is certainly not in the end of the tree, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board means that it had to be drained by road crane
Police went through the entire ship for days before drugs were distributed through these boxes
The court heard questions about his master's work on Hamal in February 2015.
Mr. Krova said that he was "shocked" about the fact that important events of daughter (9) and son (13) should be put to long, and "just want to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since their arrest in April 2015, as families are still struggling to obtain visa approval.
Ozmena's lawyer Di Mures said that he "disgusting" wants to see his family, but he knows that in the transparent future it "will not be possible".
Speaking after today's judgments, prosecutor David Harvey said: "The international drug trade is not bordered, and we, whose task is to destroy it, are working together increasingly to make it one step ahead.
"The success of Scotland in the persecution of criminals is indeed at global level, and in this case we have caused significant economic losses to organised crime representatives."
Drugs were packed in every hole on the ship, including under the floor.
This contraband package inspectors found hidden inside the ship’s sink
Mr. Harvija added: Hamal was identified by reference to information from the French authorities and by quick cooperation with Tanzania, where the ship is registered, by the Attorney General, who has also allowed the ship to be fished.
"Our investigation then came from Gijana, who provided access to essential data on shipments, to Spain, who provided us with very valuable information about the ship's detention facilities in the Canary Islands.
We also cooperated with our colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to combine specific elements of evidence.
Despite a thorough investigation into the fact that Hamal is being led by a large number of drugs, the representatives of the British authorities in international waters could not have been on board without the approval of the Tanzanian government - something they had never given before.
Suu Peitna, Head of International Justice and Organised Crime Control of the Royal Criminal Prosecutor's Office (CPS), said: "By acting quickly and precisely, the CPS Criminal Law Council managed to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to take a look at the ship within 24 hours of receiving information.
Under international maritime law, British officials are not entitled to land in international waters on board a ship flying the flag of another State unless that State has granted special legal permission to do so.
Without our criminal counsellor's prompt action, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never call these people responsible.
Photographer Brians Romejgens spends his life on the "East Express" train
Photographer Brians Romejn from Rotterdam this abandoned train photos have been taken in Belgium
The images show the moving inside of the train, broken seats, windows with dust and a narrow cab
It has already been designated an East express car, but it belonged to the Belgian national railway company
The city's explorer has taken these important photographs, which show that the waste of a passenger train has been one of the best modes of transport.
Its flower times have long gone by, and the train car and locomotive have been left to understand the train store in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photographer and adventure search.
Photographer Brians Romeijgen, 40, has taken these terrible photographs, showing the moving inside of the train, broken seats, dusted windows and a compressed driver's cabin
The train car and locomotive have been let to understand the train store in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photographer and adventure search.
These trains were a symbol of beauty when they worked with legendary names from 1883 to 2009.
The Belgian national railway company used locomotives about 50 years ago.
After 126 years on the track, the last train operating with the name of the East Express went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, closing the famous history phase.
Eastern expression was famous on the Paris - Istanbul route.
When it began in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as Express d'Orient in French.
This became an Eastern expression in 1891, and by 1930 it had already had regular routes throughout Europe.
It should not be mixed with a private Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
He left a very small "Company International des Wagons-Lits" luxury car.
In this photograph, the narrow cabin of the driver where the equipment is running is still fitted with measuring instruments and open lines
Roman said that the driver's cabin was "in its own way claustrophobic, and the locomotive noise must have been unbearable."
The abandoned locomotive and wagon have become the object of a popular photography and adventure search.
After a forgotten train visit to Belgium, Romany MailOnlineTravel said: "I could really feel how it was used in its flowering times."
Women are accompanied by beautiful dresses in high - quality shoes.
Grima artiece Katrina Gelovey's top series "Arrested Development" in Battery
Thanks to her impressive glimmering skills, reviews and conversions, Texaisete and YouTube cension Ketlin Gelovey have come to the fan army.
However, her latest conversions to Buster's Flower from Arrested Development are completely unbelievable by any standards.
For three minutes in a video uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Gelovey slowly and continuously transforms itself into a failed image with a hook in place of the hand.
Even at the end of the video, she uses an audio recording from this terrible but at the same time in a great performance.
The talented Grimm artist starts his video in his own, a picture of blonde women.
Then, with the help of slow photographs, she slowly turns into a brilliant "memmesdelin", which already has a hair loss, and which is Tony Heila Buster Blue.
Gelovya does this with colourful contact lenses, shading and drawing contours around her nose and eyes, as well as drawing the face of Baster on her head.
Wise methods: Using the slowed photograph, she slowly turns into Tony Heila Buster Blut.
During her video she also takes over the personality and manners of the cult TV image, including the Zoda.
The video that has been posted on YouTube has been viewed more than 45,000 times, and quite quickly the artist’s famous comments appeared:
"You're extremely talented," someone recorded under the video by Geloveva.
During her video she also takes over the personality and manners of the cult TV image
"I like the way you keep it all in the picture," said someone else.
Video blogger Ketlin Gelovey had already successfully converted into a picture of "Parks and Recreation" by Ron Svenson.
She told her YouTube followers that in the future she was looking forward to creating ugly transformations every week.

Lancashire father is expelled from school for wearing a T-shirt with bad words
The father of two children was expelled from the children's school for entering their sports day in the T-shirt with an insulting inscription.
Craigs Makbets (36) from Children's City in Lancashire says that he's "sucking" by wearing a tie with the inscription "Laiža and Dr.!!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his mission and wore a T-shirt, the next day he found that he was forbidden to enter the school territory.
The only father who worked for four years as the head of the Park Primary School in Cologne, Children, could not get behind the ban, and the staff even summoned social services and police.
Craig Makbets (36) from Children says that he was not admitted to school territory after entering the child's sports day in the attacker's T-shirt.
Mr. Bärnlija accuses the school directors of Saru Midjli of reacting too much.
He says that he has been unjustly punished for having put on T-screw before going to see his two children's competition.
The father, who no longer works for the headmaster of the school, said, "It was a mistake and a misunderstanding on my part."
I don't think about sports day and hurry when I wear it.
At the end of the event, we had our father's competition, and the director noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.
I apologized and cut it on the other side, and that ended the case.
However, the 36 - year - old man said that he had received a letter from the principal of the school the following day that he was invited to a meeting with the director, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"The principal of the school called me and said that I was forbidden to enter the school territory," Mr. Bärnlie added.
I learned that after the sports day some parents on Facebook had become alarmed about their concern and that many people were interested in it.
Anyone thinking about it would say that it is overplayed.
Mr. Macbeta, who is the editor of the online Love Mini magazine, said that he felt he could not even come back to the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this was the reason for the call from school and social services.
On the T-shirt was the image of Craig Charles Lister from the BBC cult comedy "Red Riding" with one of his iconic statements "Laiža and Dr..."
He said, "I told them I wasn't there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then he called me from the social services and asked why I was not behind the girl.
The school also called the police because I didn't come back to the girl for 40 minutes."
Mr Makbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer enter the school premises and that the ban would be valid until further notices.
He also mentioned that he had been warned that he could apply 500 pounds [500 kg] of fines if caught in violation of this rule.
Sara Midjlie, director of the Park Primary School, said that this case is now over.
Sara Midjlie, Director of the Park Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr. Makbetta has resigned and is no longer the head of our school."
This thing is now over, and I hope to return to the usual school life in September."
Children in the city councillor Joe Kuny said that the school has clear policies and guidelines.
"We must all bear in mind that when we take up such a position as a counselor or a leader, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not meet those standards," he said.
The counselor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school needed to apply a ban and that the fly was torn out of its shell.
Mr. Nixon added, "The wearing of such a T-shirt was stupid, and he apologized for it."
The Lancashire police confirmed that they had been called from school, but they did not arrive.
Recent renovations have been made to the former VEF premises on the streets of Liberty - there are several IT companies, the industry has already begun to call this area the local Silician valley.
The other VEF area, including the Berzaunes, is also developing.
The design and construction of the 2nd round project of the Lu Academic Centre in Tornakalna will pay 21 million euros.
The announcement of the contract for the design, construction and supervision of the 2nd edition of the technical project of the University of Latvia in Tornakalna, Riga, shows a statement on the website of the Procurement Supervisory Office.
The procurement shall be conducted in the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of the contract notice.
The contract will be concluded with a civil society LNK Industries Group, which has committed these works to a total of EUR 21 186 560.
As explained by LU, the university, starting with planning and implementation of projects for the 2014-2021 programming period of the European Union Foundation, continues the next cycle of the Academic Complex - Science Centre Buildings - Design, authorship and construction, according to the Ski Project and the specified construction year.
The nature of the science centre building following it is similar to the design and construction of the natural science centre building and its work, which is similar to the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as to the number of scientific and academic staff and students in the building.
The competition clause was added to the SIA Sixth style sketch project, which provided all possible suppliers with information on the development vision of the University of Tornskalna University in Latvia, including a list of the planned objects of the University of Latvia Academy Centre, which specifies the name of each particular object, the estimated area of the object, the planned object transfer operation year and other information.
At the end of 2015, SIA's Sixth Style carried out a meta-correction of the area of the complex of buildings of the University of Latvia in Tornákalna, which resulted in clarification of the location of the buildings of the Academic Centre and their interlinking, as well as transport organisation in and around the meta area.

"We have the opportunity to make more efficient use of the funding allocated to road maintenance works, while giving farmers the opportunity to fully apply the technique and earn," says Vladimir Kononov, President of the Board of Directors of yours.
The time limit for the submission of tenders shall be 22 August.
Legal protection: Demagogy on the mandatory health insurance model with additional financial burden on citizens does not withstand any criticism.
Any demagogy of compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and excessive burden on citizens, does not withstand any criticism, is considered by the law enforcement officer Juris Janson.
Janson met with health ministers Andu Chaksha today to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, the journalists were told that the sector financing model offered by the Minister of Health was a sustainable and developed health care system that would make it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that in this case additional funding for health care should be discussed, as it is currently insufficient.
Janson also stressed that any demagogy of compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and excessive burden on the citizens of the Netherlands, does not address any criticism, especially when the Netherlands model is called.
Janson said that the Netherlands allocates 11% of its gross domestic product to health while Latvia only 3%.
Therefore, the government and Parliament must be responsible enough to understand that this freezing point must be lifted, the prosecutor said and added that otherwise the model offered by the Ministry of Health (VM) would not work.
Chechnya thanked the legal guardian for the support and pointed out that the main concerns are that the patient should be approached by a doctor, which in turn means that the health care system needs additional funding.
However, the Minister pointed out that the planned additional EUR 35 million next year would allow only the most urgent things to be done with regard to oncological patients and the pay of birth specialists.
As a result, VM has developed a plan and has submitted a request for an additional EUR 41 million to be allocated to health care in order to reduce the lines of expertise and investigations.
"The question of priorities, whether or not funds will be available," Chakha said.
This amount does not include an increase in remuneration for medicinal products.
Commenting on the fact that the doctors are not excited about the fact that for the examination of VM in the government, all three variants of the health care financing model, including those that provide for additional payments to patients, Chachsa said that the government was given an opportunity to withdraw from all three models.
Janson also added that it is possible to make it clear that Latvia is not ready to impose an additional burden on the population by moving all three models.
VM has already been reported to defend the variant of the health financing model, which does not provide for an increase in the overall tax burden, but requires a share of the social tax to be shifted to health, says the summary of the conceptual report on the change in the financing model of the Latvian health care system.
At the same time, the Ministry has indicated that the best option for financing the health model will be chosen as a result of the discussions by the end of September.
The local arbuses are ready.
Arbusi has given up this year, recognised by Roland Dambis, owner of the Grobīnia municipality of Medzes municipality of Araj.
Arbusi has already been purchased on the Liepaja market.
By producing several early varieties, but later the bubbles have been well forgotten, the regional newspaper Kursa Timez reports.
"This year the arbusi grows better than last year," says the great oar grower in the town of Rucava Artis Kūusis.
As for the weather, it was much more favorable this summer than the previous summer when it was cold and windy.
Starts the Liepaja Theatre in Riga.
On August 12th and 13th, at the Daily Theatre in Riga, the Liepaja Theatre will visit, offering audiences both the performances awarded for the "Game Night" award and the bright intrigue - the performance of the director of Liepaja Theatre Herbert Laukstein, the portal "Delfi" informs the theatre representatives.
On August 12th, viewers will be shown the human drama "Zilion Man", which was studied by director Laura Groza-Kiber.
This is a story of a real historical person - John America - who lived in the Victorian era in London and in his body, was called Zilon Man because of the deformed body of the inherited disease.
In the study, the title was presented by the actor Egons Dombrovskis, who received the title "The Night of the Games" for the production of the role of America.
As critic Norman Aktos described his actions, Meriks is "by the heart" a role in which the image of birth cannot be repeated".
The presentation "Portraits" will be offered to viewers on 13 August.
The show received six "Game Night" nominations, including "The Big Year's Exhibition".
The director has created the study as a unique portrait gallery, just as it is important to assign each role to each picture, so that each of them is both a center and a background.
The show consists of a number of mini shows that finally connect to the same health.
It is an observation of the nature of man, where the main conflict is between true emotions and a cold calculation, quickly discovering how man changes in different situations - each of the heroes is a wolf, who for the sake of inheritance and its own benefit collapses in the surrounding, sometimes sheep, which is scattered by another.
On the other hand, both of these dates will be played in the Small Hall by the director of Liepaja theatre Herbert Laukstein's solo show "A person who is more from the lift" in the Galinas Polišchukas regime.
It is not a sad story, but a full story of how a person’s only friend becomes an elevator.
Despite the capsulated stylistics prevailing in the visual image, the dominant intonation of the study is still bright and even optimistic.
"A man who is more of an elevator" is not about the determination of loneliness and age, but about the value of life to love.
Even if it seems that there is nothing," critic Līga Ulberte wrote about the performance.
Tickets for all studies can be purchased in the "Beautiful Paradises" boxes and on the Internet.
Detective Olga: My work is not a serial, but a real life.
I already have a half-way ahead of me Olga Zelīka - the owner and investigator of the Riga Detective Agency.
She laughs loudly and leaves a very positive impression of the human being.
Dressed in white pants and white jacket - a very elegant woman who embraces all my ideas about what a woman-detector should be.
She's waiting for me with the champagne, which I'm going to respond to.
I'd say I spoke to her because it seemed interesting to me that the woman was dealing with such an unusual thing.
It's always men's work.
Olga has higher legal education - master's degree.
He's been working with the criminal police at the time.
Realizing he wants something of his own and set up his company.
It's enough to know.
"I really don't want to go back to the police," says Olga.
It's routine.
There, at the police station, we were investigating cases, collecting information.
We work with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Riga Detective Agency."
She's calling for the anniversary celebration: "There won't be a drink."
They're all solid people.
The question about her business, Olga says: "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I had a team.
Then I realized that working on the team sometimes is dangerous.
This is a business where, if someone does not work professionally, they can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists are the fifth power, we're the second.
The sphere, of course, is not simple.
Many are trying to catch us because we are dealing with the deception of our mates.
Let people think so!
Many come and ask whether hearing aids can be put on, attract dogs.
Many have seen movies.
Detective business is serious.
"It's a collection of information," says Olga.
If a crime happens under the law, I have to warn you about it.
Let's have a green tea and laugh - to have at least a chest to hold on to and engage in negotiations.
I've had a client whose husband is always lying.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We have security, too.
Her husband was a maniac.
Everything is always beautiful and good at first, but then it starts.
"It's the most terrible thing," says Olga.
Psihe is broken, and it happens that you can treat him like a cow.
This could end badly.
God don't give it to me by suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
"Many women try to get away from their families and then come back," she says.
I refuse the last order.
"It happened the first time in my life," says Olga.
There was such a strange situation.
The woman was married, and she had a son.
"Her husband sat down and made a disabled son," Olga remembers.
I believe that a woman has a mother’s instinct, and first of all, she needs to protect her children.
When that happened, she came to me with a request to be released from her husband.
There are people who are obsessed with bullying.
The most terrible thing is that the mother noticed it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We could not find the body once, and the dog was very helpful.
The drug department can't go anywhere without dogs at all.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who do not have a healthy psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are relevant.
Or there is a division within the family, and information must be collected.
It's clear what's the wrong side.
The last thing I have had to do is talk about the subject of other congregation meetings.
That's interesting, because sometimes men sneeze, now women.
Even the best friends fight!
Women's evictions for 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when going abroad because they can be sold into slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and of great trust," Olga says.
There have been cases when couples go abroad to get married again.
It's not legal.
Olga says that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
Long height, long hair.
When I was 22, tragedy struck.
He had a serious head injury.
He came back as a completely different person.
"I'm theirs," Olga remembers.
It could be compared to hell, it was terrible.
The question is, what is the most unusual thing that has happened to us, Olga says: "All are special, but it is the most obvious thing where trust is used."
When your friends are "breathing" your friends.
Takes away and doesn't return the money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is feeling like a detective, the other--it's to be," says Olga.
Situations in which we deal with infidelity are absolutely crazy, because women are often not prepared to resolve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unexpected situation because a person is not willing to lose his family.
Not every woman was willing to accept reality.
Often, young girls who feel the taste of money use rich married men.
One man who pursued his wife said that she could not be more loving because all of her wives had cheated on her.
"He had washed three times," Olga remembers.
At that time, there is already a man’s problem if all wives are cheating on him.
Olga relates the case of a woman leaving a man with all the children, and she asked him if he had ever raised his hand against her.
Above all, I kept him standing, and he answered.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
I find it interesting how things are solved - whether photographs are taken and shown to a spouse, if there is evidence of fraud.
How's that going?
"A parallel detective for work exists to protect the data of natural persons," Olga says.
This is a provocative issue.
One law allows you to do everything, the other - doesn't allow anything.
For personal interest, we may take such photographs and videos, but not for public viewing.
If a case is brought before a court which does not comply with the law, there may be serious problems.
In order to become a detective, there is not enough education and experience, it is also necessary to be mentally healthy and to meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, that's what the police do.
I'm telling customers - get out of the series, here's real life!
In fact, when I was working on the (police) system, dogs had to be used, they were very helpful.
"A drug department can't go without dogs at all," says Olga.
Some customers are looking at me in connection with the murder investigation, but I don’t like to take up such cases.
These are very serious things.
Now there are more and more clients because women tend to care for men.
It used to be different.
Now women are having fun, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Of course, most people suffer right," so Olga.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He says - stop worrying and start living real.
We all know that if you're on one side, you have to turn on the other, but you can't!
You have to say you don't like it.
It must not be done.
You can’t be afraid to lose what’s troubling your life!
You must not become a childish man, and what we allow ourselves to do is happening to us.
Yes, my first case was directly related to a husband’s infidelity when a woman was not willing to accept the fact that the man was cheating on him.
She called all the time and demanded what she had to do.
"I now ask all clients if they are willing to accept the situation when they learn that the man is really cheating on them," Olga says.
It's not fun, it's life.
If you come and hire a detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theater, a show, but a real life.
I also need a specialist.
It is a heart thing and related to Japanese medicine - hand treatment.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why did I start working on it?
This is associated with a large amount of adrenaline, and you need to calm down.
The need not only calms down but restores energy, light.
"People get out of my office positive and satisfied," Olga says.
She has a sign at the wall office, and Olga says that they write not with the help of the second, but with the fingers.
I didn't just get to it, the book about the need literally stuck in my hands.
Feel it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
You need to know more about it here.
Olga also sings.
It's her free will.
All of us are waiting for creativity.
I've been playing guitar for 11 years.
I've recorded songs and videos.
I'm positive and I'm smiling, but I need to rest to get back.
Others save alcohol, I need it.
Alcohol in the stomach.
It's a lot used in the police because work is full of stress.
"It causes aggression, and walks can be unpredictable," she says.
I'm interested in sports and adventures.
I've been working or tennis for 15 years.
I still liked horse riding.
I would like to write a book in nature, write articles.
Detective work has a fine limit when it comes to your life.
"It's a work that shouldn't be allowed into life," she says.
The question of how to combine work with private life is, Olga says, "My loved one is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
At that time there is the most real love in my life.
I've had enough to think about her, and I already feel better.
Detectives usually don't trust, but he's taken my job.
Actually, I'm separating work from private life.
I didn't get into this business either.
I'm in the middle of something.
By the time I was a child, I had seen more than anyone else.
Thanks to the things, the intuition is open.
There's a lot of detectives, but they're actually working very little.
In any case, it is work with the brain, and it is difficult to unlock.
You need some rest, too.
"Or else you can't get back," Olga admits.
The most serious case I've ever worked with is the story of Constancia.
I've been working on it for a year.
The man was literally worried about his wife.
I did so, however, that the child and his mother went to England - far from danger.
There was no other option.
We mustn't pity ourselves.
We're looking for compassion.
You must not do this.
We have to enjoy every day that we have.
Thank God.
Three good things must be said every day to someone else.
A good work should be done or a day should be spent.
We can't do that with men.
It's a big mistake.
We must understand that we have a man, not a child, and we need him to take care of us.
If not good, turn around and go away.
You can go to church, it has helped me a lot.
You don't have to be a fan, but do what you like and help.
Nothing will change if it doesn't change, you have to go away and change your life.
At any rate, you must not put yourself and your children at risk.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
Humans are created to do good and to support one another.
If God created us, we need someone and are not dedicated in this world.
You must never sit on the ground!
How better to prepare for the family photo session.
The summer is still running at full speed, as is the current year of learning that families tend to dwell on in their pictures.
For all to look happy and beautiful, it is worth thinking about how to prepare for the photo session beforehand.
The advice "Ihappymama" is provided by a multi-child mother, Aleksandra Nesterenko and a professional photographer, Marina Levickaj.
It must be photographed in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
It is much harder for children to feel and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style of clothing for the whole family, preferably in one color range.
For example, Alexandra says that she selects clothing for all six family members so that the clothes are not more than three color tones and possibly less labels on the clothes.
Don't forget about a good mood.
Have fun, laugh, play, but in no case do you complain or psycho if children are not as obedient as they would like.
And, look, the next tips are already heard from the professional photographer's pura charge!
You need to understand exactly what you want to do during the photo session and tell me about their photographer.
For some they will be beautiful, accurate children and ideally formed family image, for others - "life is what it is", that is, in the images of choice to see true, true emotions, or, how to love to say the same photographer, - "escapeous back", "caught eyes", "crushed fuel".
Of course, it happens that someone also wants "two in one", but it happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to the photo session, you have to understand that they are only a few hours away from your life, and the less you'll get excited, the better.
You are yourself - not even a hard mother who works, is ready to eat, grows up and so on, and not a busy dad today who talks over the phone all the time.
And not the man who lives behind you in some unknown mess.
Be a family, remember how wonderful it is to look at one another, smile at one another, and laugh at one another.
And then the photographer's task will only be to realize the true moments of emotion that governs between you.
If you've chosen a photographer, trust him.
Stop 250 times to ask to show what's gone wrong, listen to his advice in the choice of clothes, instead of better frames.
Drag and drop all the clothes you need to do on the day of the photo session so that you don’t have to deal with it.
Plan the route and think about how much time you will need to get to the location of the photo session (especially if photography takes place in the study and time is limited).
If you have young children, choose a time for the photo-session that corresponds to the withdrawal day regime, so that it does not happen at a time when the baby usually sleeps.
And, of course, do not forget to bring with your children food, biscuits, water and favorite toys (to be used only in extreme situations).
Dad prepares that he may need to remove his eyelids, but he does not usually write about it in these tips, and only the photographers know what the problem is, admits Marina.
Do not drink plenty of water before taking a photo session and before bedtime.
And after the photo session, it would still be advisable to have some fun together.
Go to the attraction park, eat some ice cream, take a look at the scripts - which the family likes more.
At the same time, you will have gained excellent pictures and pleasant memories of the day together.
Krasnopjorovs and Fadejeva: Lifting minimum wages - a miracle or a brake for the economy?
The issue of raising minimum wages in public discussions is almost or the status of the holy cow: either support the increase or mention any unspoken, general phrases.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (we have almost avoided the technical recession), it is important to stress that raising the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality with one house, bring Latvia's wage closer to Western European level and fill the national budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage goes too far, it does more harm than good, because it reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, especially in low-income sectors and regions.
At the first moment, despite a number of wage increases in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia does not seem to be so high as to significantly reduce the competitiveness of the companies for the few ten euros a year - only 370 euros, while the minimum wage in some European Union (EU) countries is about half a thousand euros.
However, a different view is open when compared to the average wage in Latvia (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
Since the share of the minimum wage in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6%[1]), the similar minimum wage increase is binding on most companies.
According to the results of the survey of Latvian Banking companies, each fifth Latvian company replied that by increasing the minimum wage at the beginning of 2014, it was important or very important to increase the prices of the products.
This means that, firstly, the minimum wage increase was partly financed by consumers (i.e., Latvian citizens); secondly, the price increase for several companies meant loss of competitiveness in both the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports were encouraged).
Due to the lower competitiveness and production volumes of smoking, almost every fifteen years, Latvia's company was important for the dismissal of workers (meaning greater unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleven companies replied that it was important for them to limit the recruitment of new employees in order to have the effect of raising minimum wages.
It is worth remembering that in 2011 - 2013 the minimum salary in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if each of the five companies has marked productivity improvement as important when assessing the raising of the 2014 minimum wage, it does not yet mean that a similar result could be expected in 2017 (the fourth increase in the minimum wage could gradually exacerbate the potential for productivity increase).
Another important result is - due to the rise in minimum wages, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees who earn more than the minimum wage.
The impact of the minimum wage was therefore significant even for those companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the minimum wage increase in all three Baltic countries has exceeded the growth in nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
Thus, the further increase in the minimum wage (even in spite of the overall relatively low level in the euro) will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of businesses.
An analysis of the average economic performance is not sufficient when assessing the validity of the minimum wage.
It should also be assessed whether raising the minimum wage is "panesome" in sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most frequently used.
The results of the survey by the Bank of Latvia show that the highest concentration of employees with minimum wages is in small businesses (the number of employees is between 10 and 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees with minimum wages in industrial and service sectors was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector) its further increase may be more damaging by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining its already high unemployment) and promoting the sustainability of the shadow economy.
Some signs show that the growth of the minimum wage in 2015 (a total of 27%) has slowed Latgale's development.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there is no region in Estonia and Lithuania that would remain so significantly behind the average wage from the rest of the country.
For example, in all regions of Estonia, the average wage is at least twice the minimum wage per country.
The lowest wages in Lithuania are in the Taragese region, but there was also a minimum wage in 2015 54% of the average salary (after two rapid minimum wage increases in 2016 this figure could reach 58%).
In the discussions, the time-consuming call to raise the minimum wage to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) lacks economic justification and is not implemented in the short term or in the long term.
Firstly, there is not such a high figure from the average wage or even so close to it in any EU country.
Secondly, it would mean raising the minimum wage above average wages in several sectors of the economy (which would mean bankruptcy and mass redundancy of these sectors), such as clothing, leather products, fish processing, food services and veterinary services; it is also more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
The raising of the minimum wage from January to January 2017 in the month of 400-410, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average salary) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% but the minimum wage is at least twice as fast, it clearly has a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
Such negative effects will be most widespread in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage level is often used, for example in Latvia.
The fact that we cannot allow a significant increase in the minimum wage currently means that other mechanisms must be used to support low wage beneficiaries.
The immediate effect can be achieved by travelling with the income tax of the population at an unencumbered minimum (within the limits of budgetary possibilities).
Insufficient levels of education, inadequate quality of education and poor quality of education, as well as unsatisfactory health status (which is often due to lack of attention to doctoral care and mental health) are mentioned among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey, 521 responses were received from the Latvian company on the response to the minimum wage increase in January 2014.
The question took place within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project of the European System of Central Banks.
These figures represent companies with a number of employees not less than 10.
This also explains the proportion of low-employees with minimum construction salaries.
On the last day, 11 fires have been registered in Latvia, showing operational information from the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
In Latvian terms, the biggest fires had arisen in the village of Ogres novad Ogresgala, where in the area of 80 square metres of fuel was the unmanaged residential house and in the district of Jēkabpila, where with an open fire filled with cracks in the area of 30 square metres.
On Thursday, firefighters also went to the calls of waste, tyres, two light cars, wall and ceiling buildings, stoves, roof of the living house, and a meal burned without supervision.
During the night, the service also participated in the 21 rescue work.
No reports are made of victims, victims, or survivors.
During the total day spent, VUGD responded to 38 calls, six of which were misleading.

Legendary editor Hafington leaves "The Huffington Post".
Arianna Hafingtone, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of the influential US media holding, announced the company's departure after 11 years.
The Huffington Post, created in 2005 and awarded by the Pullier Prize, which daily offers both serious policy and economic journalism, and provides for the reflection of Internet sensations in entertainment, is considered a milestone in media development when digital technology solutions have developed rapidly.
The media, already starting its work in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for its time in circumstances where there was no tweet yet, but the Facebook gained popularity only among students in national colleges.
Shortly after the Republican Party's representative, George Bush, was elected President of the United States of America, Hafington did not hide that media journalists represented liberal values, and with such a view of the world, news material was also ready.
Now Hafington has discovered on Twitter that after leaving she is going to start a new business - she plans to create a start-up "Trive Global", which would address workers' health and overload issues.
At the moment, it is not known what could be in her place under The Huffington Post.
During her work, the portal refused to comment anonymously, stressing that freedom of speech is granted to people who rely on what they say and who do not hide behind anonymity.
She was also led by a decision in the summer of 2015 to publish the news about the US presidential candidate Donald Tramp in the entertainment news section.
It is true that, at the end of 2015, when the Trampa rhetoric is dangerous to the US society, the news about the candidate was republished in the policy section.
In 2011, it was reported that the US Internet Media Group AOL decided to purchase the "The Huffington Post" news site, which was visited by almost 25 million readers each month at the time of the transaction.
The transaction amounted to $315 million.
In 2015, the huge Verizon telecommunications purchased AOL for $4.4 billion.
"Verizon" also bought online parts of Yahoo in 2016.
In addition to these transactions, The Huffington Post, an influential and independent media, became a small particle from a huge corporation.
Currently the content of the famous brand media is available in nine international editions, the total number of unique visits per month is estimated at 81 million.
Four people were killed in an explosion in Thailand.
In the Thai resort city of Huahin and in the southern provinces of the state during the last 24 hours, there have been nine explosions, killing at least four people and several ten injured, the authorities announced on Friday.
There were two explosions in the south of Thailand in the province of Surathan on Friday about eight o'clock after local time.
One sprite exploded in the bay in front of the maritime police building, killing a municipal employee and wounding a man, said Governor Vongsiri Promčana of the province of Surathan.
"I think it's related to the explosions in Huahin," said the governor.
A second explosion occurred in front of the provincial police station.
In southern Thailand, two explosions took place on Friday morning in the favorite tourist island Phuketa.
On Friday morning, two blasts exploded at the bell tower, killing one and wounding three people.
It has already been reported that two explosions occurred on Thursday evening shortly before midnight in Huahin resort, killing one woman and wounding 19 more people, including foreigners.
The woman killed in Huahin on Thursday was a Thai girl.
Of the 19 injured, three were in a serious position, and seven were foreigners, four were women, and three were men.
The bombs in Huahin were hidden in two flowers, 50 feet [50 m] from each other.
The syringes were detonated by mobile phones with a half hour difference.
Before that, on Thursday, a man died in an explosion in the province of Trana in southern Thailand.
Cops are saving babies from a car in the car; parents are threatening the out - of - the - street glass with court works.
In Riga yesterday, municipal policemen rescued infants from a car that was in traffic, while children's parents threatened police with judicial work on the out-of-car glass, LETA informed the Riga Municipal Police (RPP).
Yesterday at the patrol, an alarming man told me that at the shop center, Spice saw a car that had no adult presence for half an hour.
On arrival at the site of the event, the vehicle specified by the eyewitness, which was placed on the ground in the sun, was discovered.
The first passenger seat was a child seat with a baby.
The sun was shining directly on the child.
The baby’s voice was ringing, his breathing was intense, and his face was reddish and swollen.
In view of the fact that the owner of the vehicle did not appear on the spot, the immediate decision taken shall be to remove the rear-view glass of the vehicle in order not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with all the seats is taken from the connected vehicle, and the doctor is summoned.
The child was breathing, the skin was reddish and hot, so until the time of the doctor’s arrival, the order guards put a cold compress on the ear.
Doctors and parents arrived at the scene at the same time.
The father of the child, when he saw the window out on his vehicle, remained aggressive and the doctors did not leave the child in front of him.
Talks with parents have been conducted and it is explained that children under the age of seven are prohibited from leaving one without supervision.
In addition, the child was left with health and life - threatening conditions.
After the discussion, the doctors examined the victims and found that hospitalization was not necessary.
On the other hand, the children’s parents categorically refused to give any explanations about what had happened and threatened the work of the court on the out - of - the - car glass.
During the conversation with the parents, there was no indication that they were in the mood for alcohol or how they could otherwise harm the child, so the four - month - old baby was transferred to both care.
The case material is sent to the Children’s Law-Prophylaxis Section, whose staff will assess the parent’s responsibilities.
The RPP recalls that even if the outside is not very hot, the car left in the sun is heated very quickly.
If a child or a pet is left in such a car, it may endanger their life.
The LPF members could request the removal of the Pony.
The members of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) could soon request the Federal President's office to abolish its existing leader Kaspar Poni, LETA told the agency that former Federation Vice-President Janis Dzenis.
Dhenis said that, given the criticism expressed in recent days about Poni and his activities in the federation, several LPF members have signed a letter calling for a general meeting of the LPF, which is the highest institution of the federation, and it is entitled to decide on any issue raised in the general meeting of the LPF.
The members of the federation are not satisfied with the style of Pone's leadership, and his approach to the Riodejaneiro Olympics, which in turn were unable to access the Latvian record of the Olympics, trained by the swimmer Alonas Ribakovas coach German Jakubovski, is regarded as an unethical and unkind act of the President.
Dzenis pointed out that the LPF members, as well as General Secretary of the Federation Aivars Platonovs, have done a great deal of work for the development of the federation and sport, but the contribution of the Pones to the federation is not very welcome.
Dean, who worked for a long time in the federation, explained that the federation was supposed to try to concentrate power on one person’s hands.
Consequently, the members of the federation could also ask to amend the statutes governing the operation of the LPF, which would exclude such a possibility in the future.
Dzenis explained that discontent with the work of the Pone Federation has long existed, but the events of the last days have served as the members of the "last castle" federation to decide what action to take.
The former vice-president of the federation said that during the work of the Pone, the work of the Coach and Judges Council was greatly reduced.
Dzenis explained that, in order to ensure faster progress and decision-making in the federation, LPF members at a general meeting had decided to run the federation on a permit board consisting of Pone and two Vice-Presidents.
However, as Jeans acknowledged, Pone was attracted to members of the Federation.
The members of the federation trusted Poné, considering that this would enable them to make decisions more quickly in the federation.
"He won the trust of the members because he practically took power in his hands by taking an unethical step," said Janice.
"This attitude cannot be one of those who should serve as an example to other sports representatives," said Jeanis.
In today's view, Mr Pone has tried to satisfy his ambitions, which, in turn, does not honor him as LPF President.
LETA, LPF’s longtime secretary-general Vladimir Maslovski, told the agency that the letter could be submitted to the federation next week, and that the LPF’s overall meeting should therefore be held within a month.
In his view, the general meeting has "declared all the issues that have been hurt" and should decide on the next action.
Mr. had not yet been informed on Friday that the LPF members were planning to convene a general meeting to decide on his resignation.
In the meantime, I do not know anything about the assembly, so I have no comment.
As for the fact that the members are not satisfied with my work, so far there has been only one case, with that already coach Jakubovski, when some dissatisfaction has been expressed.
Before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this case, Jakubovskis lost his senior coach, because his actions were also not in the interest of LPF," said Mr.
He also stressed that LPF members had not been released so far at the meetings of the general meeting, which reported on their success.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the federation's work has improved," said LPF President.
Mr. also explained that the Olympics of Riode Janeiro were not supposed to be fun, but rather to work.
For most people in Latvia, it is unclear and they do not understand what the functions of the presidents of the federations are.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in this position, and, for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not receive salaries.
At the same time, we need to make sure that sufficient funding is provided to the sports federation, as only 10% of the required amount is received from the state LPF.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the international federations and various international programmes, including with international sponsors.
"There have also been negotiations and I have been working to make it one of the stages of the World Cup in Riga in 2018," said Pone.
According to the data from the company.lv portal, LPF’s revenues in 2015 amounted to EUR 249,444, which is less than EUR 36 000 in 2014.
About 40% of this amount was made up of the targeted grants received last year, which increased by around EUR 10,000 compared to 2014.
Similarly, LPF received approximately 43% of the revenues, i.e. EUR 109 442, in terms of membership, admission and other annual contributions.
In the form of donations and donations, the federation received EUR 35 532 a year ago.
Previous federal expenditures, compared to 2014, had increased by around EUR 70,000, with a total expenditure of EUR 263 876 in 2015.
The largest expenditure was not related to payments of money to persons or material expenditure, nor to salaries - EUR 215 733 is indicated as "other expenditure".
Money payments are spent on persons EUR 20 549 and paid in wages EUR 14 684.
If the 2014 federation had a positive balance sheet, then the 2015 LPF had a negative balance sheet.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) requested an explanation to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) for the participation of LPF President Pone in the Riodežaneiro Olympic Games, on which the Latvian swimmer coach Ribakovas Jakobovskis has not gone.
Latvian nationals have not been affected by the explosions in Thailand, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (AM) says an entry on the social site Twitter.
The ministry indicated that according to the Latvian Consul of Honor, the information available in Thailand did not affect Latvian nationals in the explosions.
LETA has already announced that AM calls on travellers to follow regularly the information on developments in the political and security situation in the country, as well as to make sure of the safety of the place of residence, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvia calls on the AAM to avoid places of assembly, to be particularly careful and cautious while staying in public places, and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
Travelers who are located in or planning to go there in Thailand shall be invited by the Ministry to contact tourists or airlines, specifying whether the journey will be carried out in accordance with the planned plan.
The Ministry also calls on travellers to follow regularly the information on developments in the political and security situation in the country, as well as to make sure that the place of residence is safe.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the unstable security situation in the country, it is not recommended to go to the border of Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces on the border of Thailand and Malaysia - Patany, Jala, Narathivat and Sonkhla.
In the event of an emergency, the Ministry invites you to contact immediately the Consular Department's day-to-day appointment by telephone +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
Similarly, the AM strongly recommends that anyone who goes abroad before travelling to purchase life and health insurance policy, which also provides for repatriation in the event of a disease or death, as well as be registered in the Consular Register.
However, the Messier won't leave Argentina's football team.
The football superstar Lionels Mesi, however, decided to return to Argentina on Friday, the player himself announced.
In July, Argentina's selection of the second year in a row was a tough failure at the Copa America tournament, in the decisive match again recognizing Chile's victory.
Immediately after the loss, the Messiah announced that he would end his career in the National Union, but then it was reported that he could return in the election.
"I seriously consider leaving the sample, but my love for Argentina and the selection is too large," 29-year-old Mesi said.
The Spanish Grand Barcelona attacker Mesi has won 55 gates in the ranks of the National Union in a total of 112 games, which is always the best indicator.
Together with the adult selection, Messi had not made a great success, although Argentina became the world's vice champion in 2014.
The moon has been called the world's best football player five times.
For the Chinese, Jeanne and Jelinne, double-weight Rio 20 km.
China's bidders Vans Jans and Cai Zelins scored on Friday a double match in the 20 km Olympics of Riode Janeiro.
The Olympic champion was crowned Jeans, who spent an hour 19 minutes and four seconds at the end of the 12-second race.
The bronze, on the other hand, was cut off by the Australian goldsmith Dean Birds-Smitt, who lost Jeannam for 23 seconds.
The householder’s favorite Kayu Bonfims repaired Brazil’s record, but he needed five seconds to get up on an honorable foothill.
Jane won a bronze medal in London four years ago.
He also has two silver medals in the world championships at the same distance.
Coach Judo Baskin: Nikiforenko is not the right weight.
Latvian Jewish coach Oļeg Baskin honestly acknowledged that Arthur Nīkiforenko Rio had no chance of overcoming the severest sportsman in Azerbaijan, Ushangi Kukauri.
There was practically no possibility, only minimal, if it had managed to get him into some way or in a partner.
We've already planned it.
He was prepared right, and he fought right, but the opponent was stronger.
The opponent was well - known, for Nikiforenko had already fought twice against him and both Arthur had lost.
However, he is more difficult.
Artur is artificially transferred to the most serious category of weight to enter the Olympic team.
The weight category of up to 100 kilograms was already taken up, so Arthur used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
Arturus with a weight of 100 kilograms fought against a Jew who had 140 kilograms and who had won several times in serious tournaments.
In the heavy weight category at all there is a very little random moment.
If the weights in the light categories are all the same year, then in the heavy - very rare.
The question of whether Nikiforenko would still be better fighting one degree in the lighter weight category, Baskin replied positively.
I think we should - Arthur would better fight in the category of up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not the right weight.
65% of Venezuelans want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to leave President Nicholas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Election Board announced that "no time" for the withdrawal of this year's vote, with which Chavismo will be at the power's peaks by 2019, people on the streets of Caracas continued their usual day walks as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olympics and how Michael Felps won two more medals," said Rafael Deian, a 36-year-old office worker who rested in the Altamira field on Wednesday.
The area of Altamira, located in the east of Caracas, was at the beginning of 2014 an ash unrest epicenter in protest against the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition has to exert more pressure than ever to achieve the referendum this year, people throughout the country no longer show such energy.
"I want a referendum, but for security reasons I will not participate in protests," said Deanan.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, but admit that Venezuelans are not so motivated.
The President of the Election Board, Tibisei Lusena, comments that the government is hindering the withdrawal process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reyes, (60), said Fox News Latino.
Therefore, in addition to all the barriers the government has raised to hinder the referendum, the opposition now faces a new challenge: to motivate people to go out in the streets and protest.
The referendum initiative has recently been supported by a large number of people who have not yet been able to come to the dome during the signatures collection phase.
However, when it comes to protesting against government moves to block efforts, the number of arrivals on the myths is likely to be lower.
"Some people focus on building food lines, while others are afraid of arrests and deaths after 2014," said Cipriano Eredia, the opposition legislator.
After Lusena announced that until the next step in the referendum process - an even greater number of signatures for the country as a whole - would have to wait until October, those who are against the Socialist government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away Venezuelan courage, making them believe that the vote this year is practically impossible.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum was held in 2017, Maduro could be removed from office, but he would be allowed to appoint the next president.
If he is left behind today, he is obliged to make a general election.
The US Department of State addressed this issue in a statement on Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that Venezuelan constitutional rights are respected.
"The external steps to implement the President's abolition referendum must be made clear, concrete and immediately, thereby contributing to the rapid and effective resolution of the political, economic and social difficulties of the current country," it said.
Luis Salamanka, a political analyst who was a member of the electoral board from 2006 to 2009, that changes are not expected so soon.
"I don't think there will be a referendum this year unless the social unrest and protests are even stronger," he said to the FNL.
He said that Lusena and the government were violating the law, but they would achieve their goal if people did not protest out loud.
The opposition in September called for a broad demonstration. First, in Caracas, to demand speeding up the process so that the withdrawal could take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilized in the capital today.
The government will feel pressure," Eredia said.
Salamanca, on the other hand, believes that there is no waiting period in this situation.
"They should respond to the Lusena statement faster and stronger because it practically kills the referendum," said the FNL expert.
Congressman Eredia acknowledged that some opposition parties want to make the event happen faster, but another group wants more time.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the second signing campaign will be low," Salamanca said.
In order to activate this, the referendum process needs to receive support from 20 per cent of the national voters, who are nearly 4 million people.
Salamanca and other analysts are convinced that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be disappointed.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political changes today.
"If the government concludes the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legal options," Eredia said to the FNL.
A.Pukīti, director of LINSC, is temporarily removed from office.
At the extraordinary meeting of the board of directors of the Municipality of Wielvårdes on 12 August, the majority of Members supported the removal of the Director of the Municipality of Wielvårdes Sporta Centre (LNSC) from the performance of his duties for a while while the inspection of the service was carried out.

For Ogres seniors, sports are holidays.
Today, the Sports Festival of the Ogres Pension Society was held at the sports center of Ogres.
At the Senior Stadium, the organizer for the development of the Sport Centre of Ogres, Sanita Tauriņa, who had prepared a special program for the participants of the Sports Festival, was expected.
This time individual results will not be evaluated, but participants will be divided into four teams.
"The sum of each participant's contributions will be as a result of the team," explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball tournaments, the construction of the Eiffel Tower together with the memory game, the floral activity staff, summer skiing.
In order to successfully start all four holiday programs in the discipline, participants had to perform the heating tasks - "Unity circle", "Rinkóa dancis", "Completnis", and three staffs - with horses, to perform the Frisbee and Badminton elements.
All the tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and the participants of the sports festivals performed them with joy, smiles and fun comments, while others supported them.
The special feeling was caused by the summer skiing that took place in the clothes prepared by the organizer.
The competitions were followed by volunteers from the Ogres novad sports center who managed the tasks, fixed the results and did not run the councils.
There was also a symbol of Ogres Čiekurs, who inspired the participants of the Sports Festival.
The elders of Ogres proved that they are quite active, attractive and in good sport.
The Green Team representative Peter Zeps entered the bomb in the basketball cart eight times in one minute, only for one successful year his team member Janis Staudžs withdrew.
In Agre, pensioners are active.
In the excursions, buses are always full, and about 300 people arrive at the ball.
"We meet twice a week in the Family Support Centre rooms where we can play new, table tennis, use coaches," says the president of the Ogres Pensioner Society, Janis Staujs.
At the end of the sport festival, all participants received thanks from the Ogres novada Sporta Centre for their participation, but the greatest benefit is the movement in the fresh air, a good mood and shared time.
2016/2017 Prime Minister scheduled No.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict 14 position (Warning: it is not only Alan Smita's forecast, but our journalists' councils in general)
Last season position 14
The chances of winning the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week, it looked after a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will again fight for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how empty the glass is under the leadership of even more pragmatic Tony Pulis.
However, Jeremiah Piss sold 88% of his club's share to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, in the archaeologically safe hands, which the bookmakers immediately made a favorite in the unfavourable first released manager's role.
The situation has definitely changed Balack Country - and not only Hawthorns, but also some of the Jüds on the northwest in Volverhampton, where the new Chinese owners, not too long ago, refused Kenya Jacket services.
Pulisam however To confirm that his work is not immediately threatened, and the entrepreneur has also expressed his desire not to change the culture of the club.
"I don't want to change club meetings or start an unsustainable friendship," he said, taking over the responsibilities.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our aim is to ensure that we remain in the Prime Minister and then to go further, I would like to see the club strengthened at the top of the division.
I think it's the best league in the world, and I'd like to take this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of the Police, the first aspect should not cause difficulties.
The next goal is to break down to the top of the table, but the new owner and the increasingly fragmented fan base will be important to hope for a quick break in the table on top to realize that this is an extremely difficult task, taking into account the basic work that has recently been invested among other teams.
To be further than the 14th place of the last season, to be up, there will certainly be more work to be done.
Only Aston Villa, which is located at the bottom of the table, enters the lower gate, and is worth recalling that the Christmas Albion average made less than one seat at the door in 90 minutes, almost or the worst indicator of division.
They failed to get doors 13 out of 38 games, and enter more than one doors in nine games only.
Of their 10 wins in no game failed to get more than one gate, and the seven games ended with 1-0.
As expected, a total of 34 doors were taken from the standard positions.
There is no wonder that Hawthorns' team had a feeling of dissatisfaction, perhaps most likely after the shocking 0-0 undissolved with Villa at the end of January when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only six of the best teams had better protection indicators - although no club has managed to list four half-guards in the centre.
These protections are often not sufficiently assessed, especially by John Evans, who wants to be Arsenal, given their recent crisis in respect of injured players.
The Northern Ireland International Team has experienced a great start at the European Championship, and Albion will come to be thoroughly exploited to sell.
Ben Foster's doors are reliable, and they are well integrated in the middle line.
Darens Fletchers, much like Evans, demonstrated to a large extent that he was still able to play at a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacobs is underrated.
All sides are disturbed by the fact that the long and licentious story of the future of Saido Berahino is still unclear.
In short, the owner's interest in Stoke and Crystal Palace was denied, but they still maintain peace and Mark Hyujs is ready to wait.
After the last season being close to liquidation, action is worth all parties involved.
The attacker, no doubt, is talented, but, as Pulis has already mentioned it several times, by bringing him here on one side, here on the other, it has been visible for a long time that such relationships are not working.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the documents for the change before allowing the former UK U-21 sampler to go, but his worth 15 million pounds of walk with Diafru Saho expired a few days before taking over, claiming to the club that he had undergone medical examination and had reached an agreement for everything, but he had a back injury that would mean that he would have to release the beginning of the season.
This brings great pressure on the Venezuelan Solomon Rondona, who in the last season looked very good at the moment, but he needs to improve his nine-door performance, especially if Rick Lamberts continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Viktor Aniczebi and Stefan Sesignon's retrospective also looks strange.
Pulis throughout his career is sadly famous with his slow young players moving up and down – Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts’ appearance in the last season with undissolved 1-1 with Liverpool, almost or will become the norm.
He will return to those who have already been tested and tested, yet Leko is worth keeping in sight.
The 17-year-old attacker, in general, participated in five games during the previous season, becoming the first-born Premierlīga, which is also highly rated in the English youth football system.
Matt Philips, with 5.5 million contracts with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he is the only new player who participated in the first game week end.
This would not be said too safely if the end could be rather urgent.
"All," Pulis last month said Express and Star about what would be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen back players, middle players and front players.
Targets are, we know what we want.
They are much more difficult than expected, mainly because of uncertainty about the takeover process.
The season could determine how they started, with seven largely winning games before the difficult competition with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from the middle of October.
At that time, pressure on Pulis will have become less or less resistant.
And whoever knows, maybe even Berahino will find a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue transaction after the authorised changes in pension support
The pensioners at Tata Steel UK said that the scheme could be restructured without participating in the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), increasing the company's chances of closing the rescue transaction.
The British steel pension scheme is committed to the amount of 15 billion pounds of sterling and is estimated to be at least 700 million pounds of sterling, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of a rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of the business of the United Kingdom, which employs 11,000 people, ensuring the future after negotiations with the Minister of Economic Affairs and Pension Regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the British business with ThyssenKrupp, the German Conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the President-in-Office of the pension, said that this scheme could avoid PPF if the benefits received by the staff were modified.
Although this is well-funded compared to other schemes, with a deficit narrowed to 300 million pounds for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp want to control their commitments.
Johnston said that the authorities acknowledged that it was not "real" to the joint venture or to any Tatar Steel Uk buyer to assume responsibility for financing the current and future deficit.
The modification of the benefits of the scheme was much more binding than the addition of the PPF, he added, where workers should accept less favourable conditions.
Tata Steel sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel mills, since the start of negotiations on the future of its British business in March, and this has been put on the case as a short time in negotiations with the British government.
Kušik in Chatterje, Tata Steel Europe Executive Director, said the Indian Conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable".
Speaking at the Tatar Steel Annual Meeting in India, Chatterje said that the negotiations on pension restructuring were moving forward, but he said that the scheme was well-funded.
"We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders, such as the Welsh government, etc."
There is an opinion that pensions have a known impact on goods such as steel business, so we need to find a structural solution that does not hinder business's progress.
The pensioned desire to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will support Tata Steel.
The potential change in the scheme involves shifting the rate of increase in annual inflation-based benefits from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index, and limiting future pension payments to the minimum laid down in the law.
Johnston added: "The Plenipotentiary and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period and with a low risk level outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not affected the market in recent securities in the same way as in other British pension schemes. We are still convinced that the scheme is capable of providing benefits at the appropriate level.
CBS commenter mix Michael Felps and Rayen Lohti all over the game
The Canadian broadcaster CBC Olympics commented on Thursday evening caused anger by mixing Michael Felps with his competitor Rayen Lohti.
Elliott Friedman both mixed up all 200 m of individual swimming, where he won the Felps by beating his 22nd Olympic gold medal.
When Felps crossed the line, Friedman held him for Lohti, the Felpsa people and the old competitors of the world swimmers at the top.
Friedman said, "When he's done it!"
Ryans Lohte will win Michael Felps in this game!
Felps could not even get on a decent footpath.
However, Felps won, but Lohte finished fourth.
As soon as Felps was near the gold, the CBS was silenced.
In a miraculous way, the liberator even immediately admitted his error.
I'm sorry, I messed up the roads.
Felps with gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism was widely recognized after the mistake, once again acknowledged his error and apologized to the viewers on the Twitter.
I apologize to everyone.
I'm surprised.
"No justification," he wrote.
At the time, Felps won the 2 168-year-old record as a full-time Olympic winner.
The previous record belonged to Leonidas from the island of Rhodes, who had won more Olympic titles in the ancient Olympic Games than anyone else.
Russian hackers attacked the former NATO Force Commander's computer.
The hackers published General Filip Brídlov's lists and data on one of the Soros funds.
The same hackers who had been able to carry out an attack on the e-mails of the U.S. Democratic Party and published its lists before could also be guilty of the new attack series, reports Bloomberg.
According to its information, these cyber-attacks attacked the list of former NATO Commander General Filip Brídlov and the Open Society Institute, which is part of the millionaire George Soros' supported projects.
The attackers have published the information obtained on DCLeaks.com.
The list and data of the "Open Society" Institute are inserted.
Hackers are reported to have had access to the Fund's computers for about a year.
The news agency argues that it is the same hackers who launched the attack on computers of the US Democratic Party, led by the Russian Specialist.
The U.S. Intelligence Service has already warned a high-ranking congressional officer about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party.
The news agency Reuters reports that it has information available that at the time the experts have told a number of politicians - cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence services or their controlled organisations.
However, Congressmen have not been able to transmit this information to further cyber-attack victims because it has been secret.
The attack scandal against computers of the Democratic Party began after about 20,000 e-mails were posted on the Internet, written by the party's representatives during the US presidential election campaign.
The party's candidate, Hilaria Clintone, announced that the leaking of these letters was organised by the Russian authorities.
Russian President Prime Minister Dmitry Peskov has announced that Russia has no contact with cyberterrorists.

Disneyland has provided information on the structure of the sites it has long planned, consisting of a transport network and a new passenger bridge on the east side of the park.
The project, located in the east of the attractive park 5 in the Freeway area, includes 6 800 parking spaces and a transport facility where buses, coaches, taxis and other vehicles can drop visitors to the park.

Two thirds of its population will have to be eligible for heating.
If the owners of the apartment are very excited and are specifically talking about the state of the art of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and arrange the building in all possible ways, it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that the EU co-financing from this year will be able to receive any multi-dwelling house, only the condition that the facade of the building must be heated.
Previously, it could only be used in a multi-story house.
The most prosperous housekeepers are able to organize meetings of apartment owners.
A major problem where this process is currently being integrated is that 67% of apartment owners need to be accepted.
"The previous programme required 51%," says SIA "The Home Manager of Liepaja" (LNA) project manager Tom Cirulis.
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because in most of the meetings such a number of apartment owners do not arrive," said the project manager of the Home Service APSE, Gints Ločmelis.
The largest house managers in Liepaja - Home service APSE and LNA, which serve around 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 multi-dwelling houses in the new planning period by 2020.
They do not exclude the possibility that it will be difficult to convince people at work to vote on the work of renovations, but every project implemented should improve the attitude of the citizens.
I also had to get a bank credit, 76% of the people in the house.
"In explaining what will happen - but I have got these signatures," says Vita Iesalniece, the oldest building in Latvia.
She agrees with John, who also lives in a heated building.
Well, you can't think about it, and the other side plus one person doesn't agree.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agrees with the whole measure," says John.
The representatives of the financial institution ALTUM proposed the change of these rules.
They explain that by 51% of the number of votes in banks it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has been experienced also in the past planning period.
In most commercial banks, two thirds of apartment owners are required.
As one of the recommendations for housekeepers, the head of the European Union's Department of Finance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Anda Lazzdiņa, mentioned the opportunity to introduce to citizens the existing examples and various benefits that would come from renovation of the building, such as energy saving.
In his youth, Aaron had a long history of his mother’s death.
In Canada, the arrest of a potential suicide bomber was an honorary press film.
It all started when the Canadian police received a video captured by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, the Royal Police of Canada received reliable information from the Federal Investigation Office.
Among other things, it contained a video of the so-called "mice" recorded by an unknown person who was clearly in the final stage of the preparation of the attack.
"And he was going to do it with a self-inflicted spray," said Deputy Chief of Police of Canada, Mike Kabana.
In a black mask, a man dressed in English and Arabic threatened the Canadians and promised to act on everything they had done to Muslims.
Within about three hours, using facial and voice recognition computer programs, the Canadian police have managed to identify this man.
It was 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He has already been under the supervision of the probationary service for celebrating the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
By judgment, Driver was prohibited from continuing to do so and from engaging in any radical organisation.
However, until now the authorities did not consider that the Driver could create a physical threat to the environment.
When the police arrived at his apartment in Stratroja, Ontario, the young man had come out and sat in a taxi.
At the time, the order guards tried to arrest him, but the driver, sitting on the back seat, had a syringe.
To prevent the detonation of the second trigger, policemen shot the new man.
He's dead from the trauma.
Tachometer driver is not tough.
In an interview with Wayne Driver, a neutralized terrorist father, told Canadian television that his son had turned to Islam in his teens.
This had initially helped him to cope with drugs and alcohol.
Yet, Aaron was a troubled teenager, who was a long - suffering spy on the world about his mother’s death.
Only when I saw that video today would I wonder how far he had gone.
I had no idea he was so radicalized.
"And I also didn't know he could speak Arabic so well," says Aaron's father.
The Canadian police admit - if they had arrived a few hours later, the development of events might have been much different.
Raděviča to Rio will go as a tourist and support Latvian lightweights.
The former Olympic and Lightweight Ineta Raděviča LTV Olympics said that the performance of seven sportsmen Laura Ikaunieces-Admidina on Friday in the first two disciplines is not bad, given that the athlete had a trauma.
On the other hand, Laura’s resistance to the upheaval was carried out with the right foot, not as usual with the left.
Raděviča pointed out that it is comparable - just as a person who learns to write with his right hand would suddenly be forced to write with his left hand.
Therefore, the result of the Ikaunieces-Admidine in the light of the injury is not bad.
Raděviča discovered that he has not yet contacted Ikaunieci-Admidini, but actively follows with her start and feel with her.
Ineta learned about Laura’s recent trauma and expressed support for the sportsman, pointing out that the contest did not begin to create security pillars, but showed the character and spirit of the fighter.
In other sports, Raděviča believes that the Olympic rules are very high, so one of the Latvian athletes to move that he went to Rio as a tourist is wrong.
She remembered that she too was called a tourist when she took her first trip to the 13th place at the Olympics, and it caused negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers her initials, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results," recalls Raděvič.
She told me that it was always important to have someone in the clubs who gave me the energy to join.
This year, however, Raděviča will be a tourist - she will come to Riodežaneiro next week to support Latvian athletes in attendance.
She points out that she will definitely go to the easy-to-play competitions.
Ineta Raděviča won the European Championship title in 2010.
In 2004, she took 13 seats in Athens in the Olympics and 20 positions in three matches, but in 2008, she did not start the Olympics because she was expecting her son.
In London, as mentioned above, Raděvic had a 4th place in the distance.
The film "Quanta Code" with physicists in Kašteev's main role will be shown in the walls.
The film's notes say that in parallel to the destruction of electrons in the laboratory, Kašteevs is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civically thinking man and father who is looking for a connection with Visvarano.
The film hero himself said that he had had an interesting experience in the TV broadcast of Latvia.
I found out how the top movie is, how it's filmed, how it's recorded.
"A really great job," said the physicist.
He admitted that the film had become a two-year-old.
The biggest disagreements with the directors have been about the name of the film.
I'm categorically against this name.
There's no quantity code.
"There is no secret that, in view of the film, you could know and are all clear," added the associate professor LU.
Kašteev admitted that he liked the film’s premiere, which he saw in the evening.
They are organised by friends from the Light Foundation, and these cinemas will take place every evening until 9 September.
In Thailand, four people died in bomb blasts at popular tourist entertainment sites
After the people of Thailand voted in favour of the adoption of the Military-supported Constitution, on Thursday and Friday in the five southern provinces of Thailand - in popular tourist destinations - a number of bombings took place that killed four people and injured many people.
The first two explosions took place at Huahina's seaside resort on Thursday evening, the next - Friday morning.
The city is about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok.
Police reported that in the first explosion, one Thai woman died and 20 people were injured, 10 of them foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions in the southern cities of Phuket, Tran and Surathan.
Two bombs are fired at Phuketa in the town of Patonga and two more in the province of Phanna - in the tourism region to the north of Phuketa.
During the last 24 hours, 11 bombs have been dropped in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel Krisana Patanacharoens of the Royal Police Officer of Thailand announced that the explosions were not related to Islamic extremists and were considered local acts of sabotage.
"It's too early to make conclusions," he said.
"But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is local sabotage, and we are trying to find the guilty."
After a small bomb exploded in Huahin on 12 August 2016, the investigators collected evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people were killed in a series of bombings in the important tourism sectors of Thailand.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorist attacks.
"That's why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet assumed responsibility for the attack and no specific group has been accused by the competent authorities, but the explosions took place the same week that the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phuketa and Phanna - rejected the military-backed referendum, and in the southeastern provinces of Thailand, where the majority of the population are Muslims, more than 6,500 people have been killed since the riots in 2004.
The demonstrations took place on the day of the birth of the queen of Siricita, which is the national holiday in Thailand.
The royal castle of Klai Kangwon is located in Huahina, or "the city far from the roots", where the royal family of Thailand often stays.
King Bumibol Aduljade was the world’s most influential monarch.

Porgis and Besa - what we've earned for a long time!
There are a lot of operas that have never been scanned in Latvia.
There's something that sounds very rare.
However, it seems strange if, since the 1970s, George Gærsvina's grandfather Porgis and Besa have not been studied or played, they do not count the number of hrestomatic solos such as the periodic displays of summertime (including the title works at the Ines Galantes Summer Festival), some student projects, guest shows and the like.
It has its own reasons - since Latvia is a civilised Western state, it has binding rules and copyright licenses for the family of Gērsvina, which are valid for Portugal and Besu until 2030.
The harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, the author wanted all fourteen soloists to be black.
In Latvia, of course, about the existing discussions and contexts of these operas in the USA in the race are little known and the composer's desire to perform would be difficult.
On August 6th, the concert led by the artists of four black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters to the Cēsius Festival of Art on the 10th of July, recalling the magical song in which Gērsvina had her traditions of classical European music with American jazz rhythms, gospels, early 20th century fashion dances and leftover hits, featuring the famous Ketfišrova dormitory in the village of Porgia and the light to the Bess tourist lover in such musical quality that she deserved documentation for the musical life stories.
First of all, the LNSO and the Andra Pogas.
Despite the complex venue for concert venues in outdoor conditions in the Cēsu Castle Park, the orchestra is located next to the theatre next to the scene, on which the soloists and singers (and singing great!) choir while, the overall scan was stylisticly nuanced, rich and precise contrasts in both rigid and metal ball instruments as well as in the piano party (Martīņš Zilbert).
Second, because of the excellent solo team.
The charismatic dramatic baritone Lester Linčs (Portugal) is a popular singer in Europe and America who is a repertoire of both baritone and basbaritone parties, especially Verdi operas.
The role of Porgia has been sung many times, including the Crown - he felt like a fish in the water in this opera and inspired the theatre partners even in concert to shake the emotional atmosphere of the solidarity of the poor fishermen's village.
Latvia Maurea in her second concert in Porgia and Besa (first held in 2012 no more than with the Berlin Philharmonics and Ser Saimon Retlu) was revealed as a vitally plastic combination of various vocal styles with dramaticly toned darkness and fantastic piano in the upper register.
Not by the way, she is one of the brightest today's Aids.
The attractive tenor of Jamaican origin for German Smith, which Andris Poga was currently aiming at in Boston, is the image of the drug dealer Sportinlaifa in four continents.
In it he demonstrates his synchronous singing and singing skills as a well-trained music actor.
Smit is one of the rare cleanups that seems to still hide undiscovered vocal opportunities as before 15 years ago when the opera’s voice accidentally found, ticking it to make fun of each other.
Incredibly, even in the 24th row and relatively dark German Smith’s expressive gesture language allows him to see the bag of dust of happiness in his hands even if it is not there.
How could poor Besa not follow such a mephistophilic predator who makes the illusion of a wonderful life in New York City appear empty?
Rodney Clarks, a gifted drummer, presented the role of the emperor.
The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team in Cēsus was Sonoras Vaice's performance in Sirina - a beautiful top record, a skilled balance between spoken and sung text, according to the change of voice position, vocal acrobatics and dramatism, both in Sirina's desire for My Man is Gone Now and in the stylized speaker's wide prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
The voice of Margarita Wilson was good in clairvoyance, but the iconic Summertime itself was a bit loud and nervous about getting its true character at the start.
Colorites and beauties emerged from the parties entrusted with Mikhail Chulpajev, Rihard Mačanovski, Andri Lapiņas (especially the Crab seller placed on the city walls in response to Irmas Pavares' delicious Soprano seller in the Soprano testiture of the Land).
Highlights of Ilona Bageles, Riharda Miller, Emil Kivleiniek's paintings, as well as of the performances of Ivo Martinson's screened investigator and white lawyer Juris Žagars, an unexpected presentation by Cēsus Festival Director and actor.
In the spatial concept of the concert of the history of Kairis, the choir functioned on the steps, mostly in the proscenia, rarely on the way to or from the steps.
In sufficient dynamic activity, a little comical situation was made by maps in the hands of Latvian soloists.
Their presence has a very provocative explanation.
First, some soloists sang several episodes (sometimes they found it difficult to track the identity of their audience).
Secondly, in Portugal and Besa there is a lot of dialogue, a conversational phrase, a replica that is easier to track with the events ahead.
To the listeners, a title machine was very helpful in the operation of the operas in Cēsís.
The circumstances did not go away and the first part of the concert took quite a long time.
However, this did not prevent most listeners from staying until the end to earn artists.
Nine in the evening, there is a rather late start time for full length operas, especially if a longer journey from Cēsis is expected, but opera Porgis and Besa have come back in Latvian music and will probably become one of the brightest musical adventures this summer.
Also in Liepaja, where it slept in the evening and in all other acoustic conditions.
In the field of games in Riga, a man feared children with worms.
Yesterday, August 11, about eight o’clock in the evening, the State police heard from a frightened mother of a child who was concerned that a man was in the street of Lomonosova, in a children’s field, who was afraid of his children.
The law enforcement immediately responded to the call and arrived at the scene, where they also met this man with a bull, who was very heavy in alcoholism at the time of the incident - 3.07 miles [3.07 km].
It was found that the man who was born in 1962 had already been afraid of the children so that they would not get involved.
This time, however, an aggressive man used a worm to lure his children into a field.
The man was arrested.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated in connection with the occurrence of a disturbance in public order, which is manifestly disrespectful to the public or to the public, ignoring generally accepted standards of conduct and disrupting peace.
Such a crime shall be punishable by the deprivation of liberty for a period of up to two years or by the temporary deprivation of liberty or by forced labour or by the penalty of money and by the supervision of the trial for a period of up to three years.
The presidents of the feds usually use guest accreditations in the Olympics.
The presidents of the sports federations usually arrive for a few days at the venue of the Olympic Games and use the guest accreditations that can be changed, so they have several owners during the competition, LETA told the agency the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV).
On Wednesday, a wide range of agiotage arose from the remarks of the Olympic swimmer Alonas Ribakova, coach German Jakobovska, who discovered that at the last moment he decided to go to Riodezneiro Olympics to the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) leader Kaspars Pone, while the coach had to stay home.
Later it became known that Mr. Brasil had come with a coach's accreditation, which the president himself said was a surprise because "it's not going in now."
As Vicinja said, only two federation presidents - Pone, as well as the leader of the Latvian Olympic Union (LVS), Guntis Zālitis, lived in the London Olympics.
Sportsmen live in the Olympic village as well as officials, including coaches, doctors, delegation administrations.
As a result, it is likely that in London, Ponem has also been accredited as a coach.
"The former presidents of the federations come as guests, and they have different accreditations - they arrive for a few days and then use someone else," said Wilcini, explaining that the presidents of these federations are also not living in the Olympic village.
Mr. Riodežaneiro arrived at the end of July and will be leaving Brazil on August 13th, and he will probably be there the easiest of all the presidents of the national federations.
Significantly, the Latvians were excused for swimming only one day - August 10th.
Latvia Riodežaneiro will be represented in 11 sports, and the agency's LETA calculations show that six or seven federation presidents will take the four major competitions.
The hall will arrive in Brazil on Saturday, the President of the Latvian Ride Federation (LRF) Igo Japiņš will be scheduled for the next week's BMX competitions, the President of the Latvian Vindserfing Federation Ansis Dāle on Riodežaneiro planned to fly on August 16th, when both the beginnings of Katie Birzulai and the President of the Latvian Federation of China have already ended, Dzintars Urbančiks - a day earlier.
The following week, he planned to join the Latvian Shooting Federation President Karlis Krēsliņš, when the start of the shooting for Daini Uppelnik has already ended.
The president of the Latvian Judo Federation, Raymond Rublovskis, did not find Riodezaneiro during at least Latvian athletes' competitions, although he was scheduled to arrive, the Latvian Kanoe Federation is currently not the president, but there is still a continuing conflict in Latvia's society and its athletes are invited to international competitions by the Latvian Olympic Committee.
In the meantime, the president of the Latvian Volleyball Federation Atis Drysnītis and the leader of the Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to appear in Riodežaneiro.
Vasilijevs appreciates the natural breast of Latvian women.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, screenwriter, bookwriter, lecturer and collector Alexander Vasilijevs is very often visited in Latvia over the last few years.
He recently praised the contestants "Mis and Misters Latvia 2016" and acknowledged that unlike the Russian arts, Latvian artists can boast about natural breasts and lips that are not improved by silicone and botulinum injections.
In a conversation with "Vakara News", Alexander Vasilijev said that for many years the jury president has been at the popular "Mis Russia" beauty competition.
That is why he was very interested in the evaluation of the participants "Mis and Mr. Latvia 2016".
Asking the difference between the standards of the Latvian beauty competition and similar competitions in Russia, Vasilijev stressed that Latvians and Russians have quite different figures: "The participants of the Russian beauty competitions have more paired breasts than the competitors of Latvia."
However, Latvian youths are beautifully dressed and trimmed and can also boast of natural beauty, not of the miracles performed by plastic surgery.
I therefore particularly congratulate the participants in the Latvian beauty competition on their natural beauty.
In connection with its professional activity in Latvia, Vasilijev has great plans.
At the moment, a collection of fashion historians' exhibition "Adjusted Nature" is visible in the Museum of Decorative Art and Design.
On the other hand, in Ventspil, at the Livonia Palace of Order, is the exhibition Vasiljev "Marriage clothes 1860-2010".
Vasilijev loved Ventspils so much that for a few days he also enjoyed the city’s hospitality and walked along the sea.
I like Latvia very much.
Especially now that there is a threat of terrorism throughout Europe, there is a real direction of paradise.
"To spend time and rest in Latvia is a pure joy," acknowledged the fashion guru.
In addition, on November 23rd, Alexander Vasilijev discovered the private fashion museum in Vecrica.
Please help!
Please donate to our son, brother, little boy.
We, the Rinalda family, are grateful to the fantastic people around us and to God that there was an opportunity to save Rinalda, but unfortunately now there is no possibility of fully covering the medical costs of the forces themselves.
Rinalds Grinbergs is an 11-year-old colonist diagnosed with a brain tumor at the end of July.
This year he graduated from the 4th class of the Milzkalnes Primary School with an excellent, powerful athlete and a very talented artist.
He seems to have given it all up.
A healthy, lively, unrelenting, vigorous and active boy.
Always funny and kind.
On July 26, our family will remain in memory for ever.
During the last few weeks, they had problems, headaches, but the doctors delayed it on the stomach virus.
And at first it seemed so.
Because whoever could have imagined that so "innocent" symptoms of guilt were something much more serious that the mind could not comprehend.
On July 26, we received a diagnosis - Rinaldam is a brain tumor.
Fast storage fluid in the brain, but all that doctors in Latvia can help is to perform a suffocation operation to deliver excess fluid, because the tumor is practically not available for direct surgery.
It is also not possible to determine whether the grower is charitable or not.
The following plan paid by the State: start the radiation and see what happens.
We're going to stay like this in a bad mood - we're going to experiment here, we're going to look at the results.
It was fortunate to see the results of Rinalda's investigations showing the doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice-President of the World Neurosurgery Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgery.
He began surgery, and it turned out that surgery had to be performed immediately.
The tumor creates enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the grower is generous or ill-treated to develop a plan for further treatment.
Not thinking for a moment, the parents decided to go to Spain to save their son.
At a fantastic speed, Rinald was operating in Spain on August 8, along with his mother, Evi.
A very complicated, more than 6 hours of surgery was performed.
The operation took place at the St. Helena clinic.
The majority of the tumours were removed, the pressure was reduced, the samples were obtained.
Rinald is already on his way from bed, and as a sudden teenager, he asks for free potatoes in the evenings.
The results of oncological analyses must now be expected.
Thank you to Dr. Araez and the management of the clinic, who understood the situation and operated urgently without receiving full pre-operative treatment.
They believed that the remaining amount would be paid, requested only the first contribution of 10 000 euros to operate and save Rinalda's life.
EUR 6 000 was made available to the parents by selling the technology, but the other necessary amounts for travel, living, the hospital's first contribution was made to borrow from relatives and friends.
But at least EUR 24,000 is still needed to calculate the first stage of treatment in Spain and to repay the money we have borrowed for the first contribution.
Please help us to repay this, Rinalda's health operation so important.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation already carried out and to be able to successfully continue treatment with Rinalda.
The signs of unrest in Ukraine raise the question: What is Vladimir Putin’s advice?
The truth of these claims has been debated.
Ukraine rejects them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has found some signs of Saturday shooting, but quite little to be able to delay Moscow's big plans.
Russia is aware of the distortion of events or misinterpretation for political purposes, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Ukraine's opposition forces last year damaged the power pillar supplying Crimea, and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempt to attack in Crimea is still the current issue, although there is little doubt that the Ukrainian government would sponsor the scenario of such events.
Whatever the case, the images found by the open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence ever since at least last Saturday - before the expected attack.
It shows how heavy weapons convoys, including coastal missile systems, are moving across the coast.
Intrusive Russian escalation
Some reports show that the Russian forces in Crimea had already planned a rotation that could help explain the activity, although it would be a very big coincidence that it had just happened at one of the most tense times since the 2014 annex.
Whatever the outcome of the week, Mr Putina will no doubt be even more focused on Ukraine by choosing to use this episode to the extent that it would be for a greater purpose.
Analysts point to disturbing parallels with Russia’s behaviour just prior to previous military actions against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar speeches and military manoeuvres provided protection for Crimean Volunteers to take part in a peninsula that Ukraine was still under control, only to discover that they were in fact the Russian special units that started military occupation.
In August, when Russian-backed separatists did not take place in Eastern Ukraine, Putins deployed forces along the border, warning that they might be needed to "protect" the ethnic civilians of Russia in Ukraine, which he said was being attacked.
He organized an aid convoy to a region which, according to NATO information, was only a cover for Russian invasion forces.
What is Mr Putina going to do in Crimea?
Some said that Moscow alone is not planning another military intervention.
The fighting in the Eastern Ukraine has intensified as it was before the attack in August 2014.
But this seemingly parallel could be the point where fear of military action, not of actual action, is to be introduced - this will cut Putin short in relations with both Ukraine and the Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, professor of New York University, investigating Russia, pointed out that Crimea was of minor importance as a point from which military action against East Ukraine, bordering on Russia's land part, not Crimea, and that the rest of the country was better protected.
"There is a very small possibility if the Russians are really planning a large-scale offensive," Mr Galeoti said.
Rather, "we can observe a classic Russian strategy in creating pressure."
The international peace negotiations on Ukraine, which was once a mechanism by which Putin stressed contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the Crimean annexation, are increasingly viewed as ineffective and irrelevant.
By suggesting that there is a threat that the conflict can be rescinded, Putin gives the negotiations new meaning: to get them out of the abyss.
"It's the standard Putina tactics - he wants to try to start from the force position," Galeoti said about the next peace negotiations scheduled for early September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wanted, I could make it all a lot worse."
To reach agreement with the West
Also this week, Putin said that during the Crimea riots, it was not important to continue the negotiations, making others convince them to return to the negotiating table and come to the center of the process.
What does that really give him?
Firstly, it enables Russia to continue to strengthen as a world power, although its economies are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as having veto rights with respect to Ukraine's sovereignty, to some extent maintaining the country under Russian control.
This can also benefit Putina's long-standing hope for a wide-ranging agreement with the United States to resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, with Moscow's favourable conditions, of course - also ending Western sanctions against Russia.
Puptin's plans for this objective have been made several times since the deterioration of the state economy in 2014, mainly due to the decrease in the value of public oil and gas exports.
Since the attack in Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called upon the Western authorities to join him in the great coalition in the fight against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may consider that they would need to ensure such an agreement before January when President Obama's term of office ends.
The Russian official is based on the view that the next president will be Hilaria Clinton, who is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Tramps, although apparently friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is considered to be the one who "seek solutions rather than conflicts," Galeoti said.
So it makes sense to close the window of opportunity to get something done quickly.
Until it fails to reach a wide-ranging agreement, Putin seems satisfied with Russia’s weak neighbour’s preservation, which will go on.
In the previous version of this article, the year Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine was incorrect.
This took place in 2014 rather than in 2013.
At the convention, the White House shifts funds to fight Zika's virus
The Obama administration said on Thursday that it would divert $81 million from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programmes to pay for a vaccine against the development of Zika virus by taking emergency measures as Congress did not approve new funding for the fight against the virus.
Silvija Matthews Barvela , Secretary of Health and Human Services, in a letter to Congress, pointed out that without the funds being diverted, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical Research and Development Authority will remain without money to fight skin-borne diseases until the end of the month.
Therefore, the development of the vaccine should be stopped at an important time, with Miami increasing the number of cases of Zika’s disease in the country.
Last week, 7 350 cases of Zika virus were reported in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (according to disease control and prevention centre data).
Ms. Barvela said that 15 infants were born with Zika’s virus-related birth defects.
The virus can cause brain development abnormalities and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers.
The spread of the disease in the continental United States, when the first cases were registered at the end of last month, has increased the political rates for the reaction of the federal government.
On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton stopped in Wainvud, Miami, near where there was a local outbreak of the number of cases of Zika virus, and pressured Congress to return from its five-week break to approve emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have been controversial most of the year's Zika virus.
In February Obama requested $1.9 billion for emergency funding.
The Republicans stopped it by requesting a more detailed report on whom the money will be used.
The legislators have been arguing for months about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
Last month, the democratics blocked the review of the measure proposed by the Republicans when US$ 1.1 billion was allocated to the fight against Zika virus, but included conditions that would prohibit the allocation of funds for family planning to provide contraceptives in relation to a virus that could be so transmitted on a sexual basis.
As a result of this coup, the White House was forced in April to remit $589 million to combat Ebola virus and to fight Zika virus. About two thirds of funding is intended for use within the country.
On Thursday, Mrs Barvelas said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent entirely by the end of August.
"The failure to take a decision on emergency funding for the fight against Zika virus has led the administration to choose between delaying the work of important vaccine development and the disposal of other valuable national programmes to avoid this delay," Barvela wrote.
The Democrats agree with this Communication to transfer additional non-cash money to the Republicans for the fight against Zika virus.
At the news conference, the representative of Nensia Pelosi from California, the leader of the minority, invited the representative of Poland D.Raien, the Speakers of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of the move towards this event.
"All possibilities are exhausted, and now we are looking to the National Institute of Health," said Mrs Pelosi.
Mr. Raine's advisors say that the diversion of funds was a step that had to be stopped long ago and that Obama's administration has been slowing down to bring maximum political benefits from the Zika virus problem.
Last week, the National Institute of Health announced that vaccines against Zika virus have started clinical trials with 80 people and hope to start the second phase "Zika virus epidemic countries" in early 2017.
However, as officials said on Thursday, the study will stop without immediate additional funding.
Barvela said that she would turn to the fight against Zikas virus $34 million from the National Health Service for medicines to treat other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Another 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedicine-in-depth research and development body supporting the development of medicines and vaccines in response to emergencies in the public health sector.
This money will come from several accounts, including US$ 19 million from a programme that provides for small-scale heating subsidies to small-scale families and US$ 4 million from substance dependence programmes, such as opioid dependence.
Even as Barvel said, extra money will be enough only next month when agencies come to "reasonably narrow their activity" in the fight against Zika virus if Congress does not act.
Over the past four months, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has spent $60 million to help staff protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their preparedness for the Zika virus and plans to fight it, as well as $16 million to help it establish data collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other symptoms associated with Zika virus.
Thailand's leader links attacks to popular tourist sites with constitutional changes
On Friday, the leader of the Thailand Hunt called on the public to be patient until the investigators found out what was behind the death bomb blasts that took place in Thailand this week.
General Prajutt Chan-oča, the leader of the hunt and Prime Minister, said that the criminals were "bad people", who protested against the new Constitution, which the voters approved in the referendum on Sunday.
"There are still bad people, and they worked before the referendum," he said in a speech to the people.
In the bombings in five provinces, on Thursday and Friday, including Phuket and Huahin, four people were killed and injured between tourists.
The authorities claim that the attacks of firefighters are related elsewhere in the country.
Analysts claim that the aim of the bomb explosions was not to kill many people, but to harm the tourism sector, one of the brightest points in Thailand’s economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"For whatever motive, explosions and firefights, the hunt claims that the post-referendum situation will be stable," said Sunajs Fasuks, senior researcher at the Human Rights Watch.
These attacks create discrediting effects of the authorities, terrorising society and harming the tourism sector-based economy.
Photo Thailand's rescue service staff provide the injured bomb in Huahin on Friday.
The police claim that in their view these explosions are not related to international terrorism or to the invading Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They consider attacks to be "local sabotage", not terrorism.
The chosen attack time and location have a strong political symbolism.
The demonstrations took place on Friday, when people had prepared to celebrate the birth of the queen Siricita, which is considered a Mother’s Day in Thailand.
Four explosions destroyed the royal residence in Huahin, about 125 miles [125 km] from Bangkok, where there were also most injured.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and confer greater powers on the military, even if the government is once again in control of civilians.
Hunta helped to ensure its victory by not allowing opponents to campaign against it.
Murei Hübert, South-East Asian expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, noted the military's suspicion that the attacks had been carried out by unsatisfied people.
The explosions were "precisely coordinated, but apparently aimed at creating fear and concern, not mass damage and damage and injury," he said.
Last year, 20 people were killed in an explosion at the popular Erevan shrine in Bangkok, mostly tourists from China.
Thai officials linked the explosions with Uighur fighters who were dissatisfied with the return of over 100 Uighur to China.
General Preyuts, who has been working together since 2014 when the civil government was set up, said that this week's explosions "pain the heart of the Thai people."
Why now, when the country is better off, when the economy is better and the tourism sector is better?" he said.
We need to ask why and who did it.
Golden reaction: As Simone Manuela's historical mirror looked
When I started the fight tonight, it was like trying to remove the black community from my shoulders, which is something that I'm not with just being in that position.
However, I hope it will all be gone.
I am more than happy that I can serve others by inspiration and, hopefully, by different ways of sports.
At the same time, however, I would like to have the day when we have more, and it is not Simone, a black swimmer, because the sign in the black swimmer makes it look like I shouldn't be able to beat the gold medal or that I shouldn't be able to track the records.
It is not because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and I want to win just like everyone else.
The fight for students - lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (L.G.B.T.) - defense in Colombia
Two years ago, the 16-year-old Sergio Urrego took off from the shopping center in Bogotá, before leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook, quoting Pink Floyd from the song "Goodbye Cruel World" ("Ardyu's Evil World").
Her death was the beginning of contradictions that arose this week in Colombia, where efforts to extend the rights of L.G.B.T. were seen in the broader political struggles that divided the country into two camps.
After his death, the mother of Urrego Alba Reyesa, filed a complaint against the school officials, blaming them for the exclusion of her only son when it was revealed that he and his classmates had had intimate relations.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia announced a favourable judgment to her, calling on schools across the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories of the Colombian gay rights movement. Some time ago this year, the movement celebrated the decision to legalise the marriage of a single person.
However, this week they faced an obstacle in their struggle for equality, as Gina Perodya, a openly gay minister of education, became a scandal about the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when the social media began to circulate sexually open content from the journal of pornography, spreading the message that it is part of the textbook published by the Ministry of Education.
Perody's actively exposing it.
Although the Ministry has offered help to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with a view to helping them focus on the rule, it has not tried to impose standardised rules.
"What we want for schools is a means of resolving conflicts," Mrs Perdodia said in an interview Thursday.
The debate began before the national debate on the future of the country, where the peace negotiations will be negotiated between the government and the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia, or the FARC, party groups.
The political coalition and the leaders of the Catholic Church in the opposition in the government are extremely quick to mobilize, accusing President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting a single-sex union and gender change.
In order to make everyone even more difficult, a government delegation participating in negotiations with FARC Havana recently reached agreement on gender and the equality of L.G.B.T. calling on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
The government's criticism and peace negotiations, which took place for 42-year-old Perodiya, the rising star of Colombian politics.
They have demonstrated the crowd of posters in the camps, and some have also threatened to turn violence against him and his partners, Cesilia Alvarez-Correa Glen, former trade ministers.
The Perodiya maintained a remarkable peace for the whole week, trying to correct the mistake and resume the debate under constructive conditions.
"Partly what makes me stand and keep a clear head is the awareness that there are children that will only be revealed," she said.
This is a very busy field and a very lonely time.
She also pointed out the relationship between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of a deal with FARC, which would be a turning point for the country's earthquake, they have to consider the origin of the conflict, she said.
"Is there a nation that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it a country where everyone has equal opportunities?" she asked.
Even though she did not like to be the target of insults and abuse this week, she is happy that today's gay students in Colombia can take an example from her and think that they can also try to become ministers one day.
"It is very important for them to be calm and to realize that they can fully realize their potential," said Mrs. Perodya.
We can't wait for a new suicide to start changing something.
Keep your vote cybersecurity - The New York Times
"The U.S. is looking for ways to keep hackers per piece from election polls" (Newspaper, August 4th)
Minister for Internal Security, James Johnson, says Obama's administration is thinking about additional security protection of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Cyberhazard in various expressions and the recent discovery that external forces may be national countries are increasingly interested in the influence of our elections, demands that the federal government pay further attention to the provision of our electoral system and may consider it part of our country's essential infrastructure.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that help to conduct elections and offer assistance, advice and management to the Department of Homeland Security.
While the diversity and diversity of our voting infrastructure is hampering its efforts, this tells us that the process should start as soon as possible.
The writer, a Democrat from Mississippi, is a high-ranking member of the National Security Committee.
In Pennsylvania, a boy injured in a carousel, this week is the third time in an attractive park
On Thursday, falling from the carousel, some boy and taken to the Pittsburgh Hospital was injured. The Quick Help Service and Park Officers say this is the third accident this week in the US Attractive Park, in which children suffered.
A child whose name is not discovered was only taken to a children’s hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 km) west of Aidlavailda and Sokzona Attractions Park in Ladjojer, Pennsylvania, said a representative of the rapid assistance services in the West Murland area.
The three-year-old boy who was visiting with his brother while he was being helped on the spot was conscious, e-mailed the park representative Jeff Krushors.
Crusher said that the "Rollo Coaster" attraction would be closed at the time of the investigation.
Children should have at least 3 feet (91 cm) in Aidlavaild in order to be able to visit the body, and those less than 4 feet (122 cm) should be accompanied by adults.
The attraction, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938 and the State Department of Agriculture indicated that it was inspected in August.
The representative of the hospital refused to comment on the boy’s health.
On Sunday of the neck injury that will come from the world’s highest water mountain in Kansas, Kansas, a 10 - year - old boy died.
On Monday, three 6, 10 and 16-year-old girls who fell from more than 30 feet (9 m) high were delivered to the hospital during the annual market in Greenville, Tennessee.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe Abe will not visit a shrine during World War II in honor of the memory of the war: Jiji
News agency Jiji reports that Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe Japana will not visit the controversial Tokyo shrine during World War II, which honors the memory of the war.
Thursday, Jiji reported that Abe, however, was planning on Monday to send Jasukuni to the temple a ritual gift for honor for the anniversary.
The temple also honors the 14 Japanese Caravans, who are convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea consider it a symbol of the militaryism of the Japanese royalties.
Both have not visited the shrine since December 2013, when he announced that he visited it to show respect for those who died for his homeland.
The new Japanese Defence Minister Tomomi Inada has not answered the question of whether he will visit the shrine, explaining that it is a question of conscience.
Inada - a close supporter of the amendments to the pacifist constitution of Japan - has visited Jasukuni regularly in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that Minister Masahiro Imamura visited the shrine on Thursday and said he was praying for Japan's peace and prosperity.
The relationship between China and Japan, the two major economies of Asia, has become more tense following the increasing presence of Chinese coastguards and other national ships in the conflict-stricken vicinity of the South Sea, which in Japan is called the Senkaku, but in China as the Diaounde.
Detained two suspects in the planning of the Rio Olympics terrorist acts: police
On Thursday, the police arrested two people who were suspected of supporting the Islamic state of the group possible in planning an attack during the Olympic Games in Riode Janeiro.
Before Thursday, the police had already detained 12 people, all suspected of cooperation with the Islamic nation's fighters.
The Brazilian federal police report that three more people were understood and later released.
Both prisoners are Brazilians on Thursday, but the police do not disclose their names and other information.
Although there has been no conflict in Brazil’s history with the known groups of combatants, the government reports that the Olympics have made the country a more up-to-date goal, especially because the countries fighting against the Islamic State participate in the games.
Its fighters control certain territories of Iraq and Syria, and the US-led coalition has made air attacks on them.
The group has supporters all over the world who have committed the killings and executions of civilians.
Officially charged with the murder of a newly suspected French priest
As part of a murder investigation conducted last month by the French priest against a man arrested on Monday, official charges were filed, and Reuters reported a source of information to the police on Friday.
Against 21-year-old suspects, investigations into cooperation with terrorists are being carried out, and he planned attacks on people, mentioned a source of information.
The man was contacted by telephone with Adele Kermic and Abde Malik Petitján, who stopped church service in Sentencing Du Ruve, West France, on July 26, and crossed the line for the 85 - year - old Roman Catholic father, Jacques Amel.
Both policemen were killed.
The suspect had returned from his home near Tuluza, to the town of Sentencing du Ruve, and had spent the night there the day before the attack, the source mentioned.
The young man who had not previously been convicted admitted that he had spent the night there, however, told the investigators that he had been away the next day because he did not have a good relationship with Kermic and Petitjan, said a source of information.
Investigators are trying to determine whether Kermic and Petitjan were partners in France and whether they were related to the Islamic State that took responsibility for the attack.
At the end of last month, a pre-trial detention was applied to the brother.
Doruss de Vriess before switching to Celtic undergo medical examinations
Nottingham Forest Club Warguard Doruss de Vriess arrived in Glasgow because he hopes to conclude an agreement on a transition to Celtic.
De Vriess was photographed, entering Roshol's hospital before medical examination after Hoops agreed conditions with the Sky Bet Champions Club.
The leader of the Parkhead Club, Brendan Rogers, is looking for an experienced centre to protect the current first room for Craig Gordon to compete.
Tommet Rogers will trust the 35-year-old de Vriesm because he worked together with the Dutch at Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in the composition of Swansea, which they played under Rogers' leadership in 2011 and right to move to the Prime Minister.
He changed the form of whales to join "Wilki", and has been City Ground since 2013.
He has also played in Scotland during his career after the Diunfermline season, after his transition back in 2006.
Her stay was markedly ended with sadness, however, by Pars experiencing double agony while being "sended to a trim" from the highest level, before losing Celtic Scotland's cage.
The guardian under the contract had still remained a year in the forest composition, and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to get his signature.
Macy's will close 100 stores.
Magnitude giant Macy's announced on Thursday its plans to close 100 stores, which is a dramatic step to help the store chain get ahead of a potentially conspiracy problem: in America, it claims, is online shopping for the era too many shops.
Macy's regularly reduces its store portfolio, often closing several dozen poorly profitable stores immediately after the annual holiday crowd.
However, in its summer statement that it would close up 15 per cent of its 728 trading venues, shops appear to have taken a much more aggressive position than many similar retailers in terms of reducing its number of shops by adapting to the very variable purchasing environment.
Visitors and buyers go along to Macy's store in New York.
The retail giants say they plan to close 100 stores.
Macy's has a lot of reasons to try to change: many of its stores are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by e-commerce.
In general, the category of supermarkets has become more difficult, as buyers are increasingly choosing lower price retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion workers such as H&M.
These factors, together with short-term difficulties such as increasing international tourist costs and seasonally inadequate weather conditions that Macy's has put in an unstable situation that has been strained for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales volume in the last quarter had fallen by 2.6 per cent, a very weak indicator, however, which was an improvement, taking into account the very bad fall of 6.1 per cent in the year-on-year turnover found in the previous quarter.
The retailer’s income was $5.87 billion (US$ 7.64 billion), by 3.9 per cent less than it was in this period earlier.
Macy's said that closing shops would cost it about $1 billion a year in turnover.
And the closure of so many shops could at the same time be regarded as a recognition of the collapse of the retailer.
However, the value of the company's shares decreased by 17 per cent on Thursday, which shows that investors take this move as a proactive measure that reports on Macy's stronger future.
In its sense, Macy's reducing the number of stores should not be surprising.
The Director General of the retailer, Terry Lundgren, has said earlier that there are just too many shops in the chain.
For a time, senior managers said that they had adopted a new strategy, with a special emphasis on 150 of its most profitable shops in order to achieve higher sales in the most profitable trading venues.
Jeffs Jenette, Macy's director, who has been appointed instead of Lundgren since 2017, said in his statement almost all the shops the company plans to close are those where sales volume and profitability slip down.
"We realize that in these trading venues we still do not receive adequate return from investments and often do not have the level of buyer purchasing experience that reflects our efforts in relation to the Macy's brand," said Janet.
The company announced that it would come forward with a list of shops to be closed later.
Macy's said that while still being decided on closing stores and that therefore it is not yet known exactly how many employees will be fired.
The retailer has not completely withdrawn from the main markets where he currently has stores, but it is thought of closing shops that are less active.
This walk will most likely not suit the managers of the shopping malls who are counting on large tenants like Macy's to attract their shopping malls and keep smaller shops.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, drinking from a refilled bottle may be "a lot worse than dropping your dog’s toy", given how many bacteria will come in contact with.
The Web site Treadmill Reviews asked EmLab P&K to check 12 four different types of water bottles - with a screwing hook, with a standby hook, with a pressed cork, and with straw.
Each bottle was used by a sportsman for a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle may be as unclean as a dog toy.
"On the basis of 12 of our tested water bottles, we found that the reusable drinks may have an alarming number of viable bacteria cells: more than 300,000 colony units per square centimeter (KVV/kv.cm)," says Treadmill Reviews.
The maximum quantity of microbes per square centimeter (CVV/kv.cm) was found in bottles with suspended caps, more than 900 000 colonies.
The bottles contained microbes that could cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood contamination.
Bottles with pressured shells were the next worst with 162,000 KVV/kv.cm, while the screws with screws contained only a little less than 160 000 KVV/kv.cm.
"Drinking water from such bottles can be worse than eating from your pet's pot," says the website.
A much better view is observed for bottles of strawberry containing only part of the bacteria in other bottles - only 25 KVV/kv.cm.
This could be because the water fills up to the bottom of the straw rather than fits its sides and thus attracts moisture to loving microbes.
Bottles with strawberry microbes are described as "most safe."
"On the basis of our test results, we recommend choosing a bottle of salmon and small bacteria, both because of the absence of harmful microbes," said the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles without cracks and difficult clean places will have fewer microbes.
On the website, it is recommended to wash the bottles after each use, ideally using a low-whiteing solution.
Religion Must Be Modern or Forgotten
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently nominated Hilari Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the last polls prove true to the elections themselves, in January America will inaugurate its first president - a woman.
The previous week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Tereza Meja discussed Britain's withdrawal from European rules with German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Women raised in Western society are raised in such a way that they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity thanks to education, ambition and hard work.
And today, young girls can aim at a number of existing models in the highest leadership field.
So, is the long and heavy struggle for equality of women finally over?
Hillary Clinton is ready to become president of the United States at any time, but women's leadership in religion remains a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
The leadership of women in religious matters remains a controversial issue.
Last week Pope Francis announced the establishment of a new commission to assess whether women would be assigned to the diacons in the Catholic Church.
In January 2015, the Church of England dedicated Libya to Leine as the first woman-bishop, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
As long as women's rabbinic movements have been ordered in the reform movement since the beginning of 1970 and in the conservative movement since the beginning of 1980, the concept of women's rabbinic in orthodox Judaism is still very strong.
In November 2015, the American Orthodox Council of rabbinic countries published in its third attempt to halt the growing wave of support for the proper management of women in the rabbinic order, a very sensitive message that the concept of female rabbinic is contrary to the law.
Not without irony when Hillary Clinton was nominated as the candidate for the Democratic President, the group of American leaders of the right-wing rabbinic who opposes the women's order began a series of "debate" on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between time and time?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, is looking for stability in what it considers to be long-lasting traditional values.
This shows the ability to resist pressure to adapt to changing society.
Those who oppose women's orders do so on the grounds that it is not "traditional."
However, overtaking with the preservation of traditions in this way is at its price.
And the price of such unilateral thought can paradoxically affect the tradition of itself, with the exception of the traditional community of oxygen that it needs for the maintenance of life.
In the book "August Shooting Arms", in World War I military history, Barbara Tachmena stresses how dangerous it is to give priority to the tradition of what has become known as the "red-billed tragedy."
By the start of World War I, when the war had passed from fighting to the heavier artillery that was being fired from the distance, it became useful to hide the soldiers as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by replacing their lit uniforms with long - lasting greys and browns.
The French soldiers, however, still wore the same red hats and pants that made them easy to reach.
The proposal made by the French Minister for War Affairs Adolf Mesimi that his forces could act in a similar manner was perceived with ridicule and resistance.
The Red Ridings reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military traditionalists were not prepared to give up.
Speaking in parliament, former Minister of War Eigen Etienne spoke on behalf of France.
"To give up red pants?" he cried.
Sometimes!
"It's an indistinct and idiotic annex to the most visible of all colors," Mesimi later wrote, "it had to be a bad consequence."
Leaders of faith who fight for the inclusion of women in the leading religious roles could be included in the same ranks.
Focusing solely on "traditional" religion, rather than asking the important question: "What changes are necessary to make religion rise?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also deprive the whole community of talents, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise provide.
It may be traditional for men to keep on wearing pants when it comes to religion, but as the rubble of red pants shows, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is a student of orthodox women's associations in Britain and an orthodox rabbinic student in Jeshivat Maharat, New York.
The children of the Rojas municipality in the camp acquired new skills.
From 1 to 6 August, the camp "Varawiksnes Bridges" took place in the centre of Rojupes' children and youth initiatives, during which participants expressed creative expression, sports, and acquired new skills.
We arrived at the end of the day when the children were thrilled to see the glass jars painted.
A youth specialist at the Rojupes Children and Youth Initiative Centre, Māra Folkmane, said that this was one of the activities that the participants liked most.
The visit of the "Mazbebriņi" of the Einar Mountain table was also a great pleasure.
The children liked lasergravier the most because it was possible to see how the drawing in the computer is gradually applied to the son.
E. Kalniņš has told you what subjects at school should be taught if you want to work at the table, that is, the main thing is mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, and technical drawing and drawing.
He also stressed that this profession requires more work on brains than on muscles.
The small Czech Republic has individual orders, and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know others better, at the start of the camp, the participants participated in the various games, as well as jointly forming the camps "herboni".
On Wednesday the passage took place from the sea from Paradise to Jocquene, and natural materials were collected along the way, which were later used to make maps.
Sports games that are of particular importance to participants were also launched.
We went to multi-dwelling homes where we had a sports and relaxation area, played football and a network bomb.
Children like sports activities, we have a lot of boys who play soccer, basketball, and every time they demand something sportsy.
Girls like more peaceful jobs.
The next day, with the help of a self - sustaining mass, decorative jars, which can be used as seal holders later.
There was also a talent evening, the children chose to speak together, and one evening was dedicated to performances.
Table games were also played, each one could show his own knowledge at the time of orientation of the photo where objects were to be found and photographed after the paintings.
The task of each picture was to meet differently.
We also dyed mandalas - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one job that everyone likes - one that is closer to sports, another that is creative.
"Now it seems that everyone is acting curiously with the painting of the glass," explained Mr. Folkmane.
At the conclusion of the seminar, diplomas were issued on creativity, sport and assistance - several children helped directly in economic work.
The name "Varavīksnes bridge" was created because children from three associations - Rojupes and Montenegro Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the "Strops" multifunctional centre of the Rojas municipality.
They are such bridges.
If parents think of something faster, we take the ideas; if the other way around, they take it from us.
We share an experience.
This year 30 participants were involved in the camp - children who worked actively during the year.
"We had planned that there would be 30, and it also gathered," says Mr. Folkmane.
Nometne has already taken place in the fifth year.
It began in 2010 when the social service of the Rojas municipality decided that it was necessary to organise camps for families of multiple children and for children with disabilities in the summer.
However, the situation in Paradise has improved in the meantime, and the camp is now designed for local residents who come and operate youth centres.
The aim is to spend free time in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.
There were two camps in the past and 20 children were involved in each, while only one camp is currently being held as a result of a decrease in the number of children in the country as a whole.
Similar activities are taking place during the following year.
Children paint, painted glass, came to the villages of Einārs Kalniņš, who taught wood burning, wood carmaking, with figurines of various forms.
There is also a new technique - enkaustica, it is coloring with hot wax cream.
Teacher Ilze Shelkova was in charge of the production of polymer material, we made colognes, and various crucifixes.
We make paintings from natural materials, interesting mandarles from bees, bees, lentils, we collect leaves in autumn.
We're trying to use what's around us.
The youth centre works from 3 p.m. to 2 p.m. and in the summer - from 2 p.m. to 2 p.m.
"On average, 15 children visit the youth centre in Rudus a day," says Mr. Folkmane.
She emphasises that great support is provided by the council of the Rojas municipality, which understands that it is necessary to give money to children because they form our future.
Charlton Athletic fans "can only get a season ticket if they sign a behavioral contract" and agree not to criticize the club's social media.
Although we recognize that each one has the right to his own personal opinion, publishing silent comments on such websites is not for the best.
A fan working in the field of administration was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from former senior police inspector Cliff Igger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career police force.
In the following letter: "I need to inform you that the allocation of the season ticket will be renewed provided that you sign the "Harmonized Behavioral Agreement" (ABC) which will provide that you will refrain from further posting of malicious or mulsifying comments on the social media websites of all kinds to people representing clubs or clubs, or any other behaviour that might be considered anti-social."
Speaking to Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after a season ticket that it was not received, and two days later a letter was received.
Yesterday he went to the club and said, "They told me I was too much "twisted," saying, too, to others who are funny."
Wheelchair holidays in Dalmatian coasts
What do you mean by the word "breath"?
I am driving here with all my strength," said Colina, former commander of the U.S. Marine Forces, who had just taken a 25-year-old wheel trip along some uneven central part of the Croatian island, leaving nothing there, except the spout of sweat and salty seamen, scattered in the hostile mountains.
Some riders sing hymns or a number of children’s gardens to make it easier for them to be in the mountains.
Colin's friend Pettia recommends "The Little Engine That Could".
Other rhyme or simply suffer in silence, thinking of what it requires to get to a trance in a similar condition as the wheeled riders speak of.
Colina's getting better than she's getting better than she's getting better.
To drive a few yards ahead of her is like Hugh Grant's back in the beginning of the movie "Four Weddings and One Bears".
They and my mission are a week-long "luxus" yacht and cycling trip along the coast and islands of the North Dalmatia of Croatia organized by Freedom Treks.
The ride in summer's heat at a fixed mountain place like Croatia may not correspond to every sense of beauty, but it is said that the North Dalmation is easier to get out than the South Dalmation, our sails are soft, and when we filled in the booking forms, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a window that we did not notice that could have provided us with the battery-charged e-bicycle.
The luxury part of the deal is our swimming house for a week, a whole new "Melody".
At the end of the journey we can ride our bicycles in a crowd at our guides Ivana and Ivana and the ship's back to the blue water, without encountering sea urchins, sharp stones, and other people on narrow stone strips called the Croatians.
In June the water temperature at sea is perfect, everyone agrees: it will be cold enough to cool down, but not cold.
There are masks and breathing tubes on Melody and some kayaks when someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the sails.
Instead, most of us return to our cabins with air conditioners, where Helena, the ship's masier - I'm not kidding - will have already laid our beds, added our minibars and left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that walking after a ride is very important, and in the afternoon we learn to walk on our beds or with the cushions on the upper deck together with the bar Antonio, who is always ready to prepare one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and semi-duck crews, not an elaborate super yacht, but a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns towards a small island port between fishing vessels and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Colina and Petija belong to a group of friends from Washington, Colombia: to sports and social activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year’s bigotry and bicycle holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something even more richer for their adventures, so they are in Croatia.
The competitive chapel from their church is on a sailing and cycling holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the air brings together the competing Facebook publications of the Pingpong rally.
The element of holiday experiences can be played because our schedule is nothing unless a specific regime is established.
"The breakfast and dinner are at eight," Ivan announced to the new participants at the opening meeting, when we started our way from the beautiful old port of Trogir, which is close to Split.
One ship’s call signal shows that the buffet is open, while the other at the end of the meal invites you to observe the silence and listen carefully to the following information.
"Good morning!" is a cultural context that may have been lost everywhere, but not in the British contingent.
What a difference - fun has already taken turns, jokes can be made from overcrowding, while Ivana issues the day's tour cards, but we all hope that we are afraid of the dive, the passage and the profile of the contours with the climbs and falls, although any other surprise would be on the Croatian bike which starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," said Ivan.
Full co-administration is not recommended.
Ivan is conducting an information meeting in parallel, freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with a dozen different people, but we are a simple group - Swiss, German, American and British, who sit easily at the tables during the meals, where they speak English at two and one at the German.
On the way, we're all friends.
Ride drives promote society, and the only competition is within, respectively, itself.
I do not remember when group dynamics would have been more harmonious and more relaxed.
Soon we're leaning on Ivan's wave.
A small increase is a slope that should not be mixed with inequality, which is a good thing.
Matadats are serpentines and straight forward means straight: simple but not always easy.
The driving instructions are always the same: "Go one by one, keep the distance, and they are not a competition.
Meet me at the beach at nine.
Okay, five couples - I forgot you were on vacation.
Take plenty of water.
From Trogir we will spend two days on the cross north through Kornati Archipelago, where we will go almost all along Dugi Otok - in the Croatian language "garo island" - and after a little snack we will walk along the Telascica nature park by admiring its standing cliff and salt lake, in which the underground canal flows of sea water.
It says that those who dive in it become younger because of its power.
If we do, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
In the small island of Molata, we return to the south by moving from the continent to the nearby islands, apparently by accident.
Most of our journeys are on empty small roads out of the country with large views of the sea and a variety of plants: olive grove, wine gardens, sharp plant brigades, Mediterranean scents in the air and countless cups in the flight.
We move forward, there's always a moment, but when Ivan stops, there's always a big shadow, and the little mice are like a reward for those who arrived faster.
Sports and public activists go a lot on bicycles at the end of the week, and they know the rules of conduct, sending warnings by line and leaving free places so that motorcyclists can make the accommodation manoeuvres much safer.
"You're almost or fucked," one wheelman tells the other after the heavy car driver decided to make a siege maneuver in the invisible curve and quickly braked.
The brakes worked for luck.
Ivan divides us into three groups each in a row for short stages on the main roads, with Ivan himself behind to encourage and "put pace", as Ivan says.
If we have to cross the main road, we all meet, we fall off the bikes and safety after crossing with our bicycles on the other side as instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan realizes that he's not talking to a group of children?" asked the Swiss biker when we stand by the road and wait for the signal when we can cross it.
Not all afternoons can be spent on casual rest.
A Roman forum and seabirds playing music that sings as the flag of a prisoners of the sea, through stone-worked pipes in a promenade and open water are being opened in the city’s view.
Zadar's famous sunset perfectly coincides between the basic food and the bottle, and after dark entry we return to the sea eagles and observe the wave-operated lamp game on the glass sidewalk, which is actually a dance floor.
When "Melody" starts its way early in the morning to the beautiful Biograda resort, the song of the eagle is no longer more than just a chump.
On the fifth day, we are completely free from the wheel ride.
The trip up the estuary of the Krka River to view its waterfalls; then the afternoon tour of Sibenik, where we look at the thought cathedral, the masterpiece of Dalmatian Renaissance, as well as the passage of the chair to the peaceful island of Zlarin, in search of its local treasures, makes this day interesting.
Lurda is going to take the holidays in the shadow of the attack
During the annual Catholic celebration, people gather at the Church of the Lord.
The French security forces are in a high emergency because thousands of Catholics meet at the Church of Lourdes in the shadow of several acts of terror.
Every August 15th, thousands of people gather at the temple in the mountains of Piraeus to celebrate the birth of the new Mary in heaven.
This year’s celebration takes place at a time when Catholics have been shocked by the killing of an older French priest on July 26th by two Islamic extremists, who during their stay entered the church in the north of France and crossed his weapon.
Zacka Amela's killing took place two weeks after a Tunisian -- investigators claim that he was radicalized by jihadist online video material, -- got hit by a truck at the Bastille Day party in Nice, killing 85 people.
After three major attacks within 18 months, many French citizens are cautious about visiting public events.
The number of tourists had dropped dramatically, and the authorities were alarmed that this year’s number of pilgrims could quickly fall.
However, fear of mass withdrawals has not materialized -- and some organizers say that even the flow of visitors' applications has been observed at the last moment.
Approximately 25 000 believers are expected to arrive, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and about 200 Christian delegations from the Eastern Hemisphere.
Many pilgrims have said that they did not allow themselves to be intimidated.
"We do not intend to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Kristians told AFP, describing prayer as the "one weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life is going to continue," said Mateo Guivars - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, or our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to the concerns about security in France since the attack in Nice, a number of large-scale measures have been lifted, including a huge stock market in the city of Lille and the European Cycling Championship to be held in Nice in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone would call in one call to withdraw applications," said Fabien in Legesne, a priest responsible for the official pilgrimages last week.
"On the contrary - it seems that the attacks have mobilized the believers," he said and reported on the recent influx of applications.
Christian Zhel, head of the Association of Local Hotel Workers, confirmed the "high interest" of the holidays following the attacks.
Around the sanctuary where young Mary was playing in 1858 for the poor shepherd Bernadette Subiru, there were extremely strict security measures.
About 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers, including bomb neutralisation experts and experts with explosives search dogs, have been deployed to protect the sites.
In addition, the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three as a result of a break through security barriers.
Catherine Simcox, who traveled from northeastern England to Lourdes at the beginning of this month, described enhanced security measures.
"Until Thursday morning there were armed guards in the temples, and then through the doors (with metal barriers) could only go one by one, and the bags were searched," she said.
"All this frightened my three children who had come to Lurda, and it was hard not to scare them when they asked why it was happening," she said.
It did not damage my impressions, but it made me sad that it was necessary, and I understood that many people had taken these measures to rest.
Friday's opening procession is also shortened - instead of starting in the city of Lurda and going further to the temple, it will start and end in the temple.
Other measures include closing the airspace for flights above Lurda, closing the streets in the vicinity of the transport facility and replacing the waste urns with transparent plastic bags.
French Interior Minister Bernard Kazenēv will examine security measures on Saturday.
About six million people go to Lourdes each year, making it one of the world’s largest Catholic holidays.
Many visitors take relatives who are ill or with disabilities and who arrive to swim in the well where Bernadette has seen Mary in faith of her medical properties.
In Tari Castijo, one of the organizers, described this year's meeting as "a bit unusual", taking into account "the threat, as the roots seem to be searching for in France."
However, he argued that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experience.
François, a 58-year-old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that he felt that the presence of soldiers dressed in civilian uniforms was "a bit exhilarating."
However, if it calms everyone down, it is good.
Two wounded at the Saragos Trade Centre
Two people were seriously injured after a man opened fire at the shopping center in northeastern Spain.
The incident took place at 11 a.m. on Friday morning at the full Aragonia shopping centre in Zaragoza.

After the shooting, the armed criminal ran away, and now the police are looking for him.

Discovery of the waterbird hunting season is imminent.
Each year, on the second Saturday of August, the season of hunting for aquatic birds is open.
This year it will begin at 16:00 p.m. on 13 August, so the State Police call both hunters and citizens to be especially careful and to comply with security rules.
Waterbird hunting takes place not only in hunting areas but also in public waterfalls, and although weather conditions do not cause heat as they do for other years, it is possible that these waterfalls will also be used together with hunters.
We call on both hunters and resters and those living in watercourses to be particularly careful in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, so that they do not endanger themselves or others.
As it has been observed in previous years that a large number of hunters are involved in the first days of the opening of the season, this year the National Police, in cooperation with the National Forest Service, will carry out enhanced hunting control.
During the control period, law enforcement will focus on compliance with the rules of the arms and ammunition movement, as well as on monitoring that hunting takes place without the influence of alcoholic beverages and depleting substances.
Police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms with a total capacity of more than three cartridges, including the attention to amendments to the arms and special means of transport, in particular paragraph 22 of Article 91, which states that persons whose firearms or large energy weapons are registered for hunting or sport, and during the short stay up to two hours when these weapons are transported to or from hunting, shall be entitled to hold firearms and ammunition in a vehicle during hunting, but shall be placed in the safest position of the person with whom the firearms or other weapons are placed, shall not be visible during the safe period of the vehicle during which they are stored, and shall not be exposed to firefights, if they are not locked, and if they are locked by the guard, they are not locked up, so that they are locked away from the doors of the vehicle.
The police are calling for the care of themselves and their fellow humans during the hunting season and, if there are any violations of the law or any threats to security, we call for immediate reporting by telephone 110.
In any event, the legislators are prepared to respond to the information provided by the public.
New Caledonian coasts satrikin 7,2 magnetite earthquakes
On Friday, the New Caledonian coast was hit by a 7.2 - magnitude earthquake, reported seismology, indicating that the tsunami is not a threat.
The Earthquake epicenter was located at a depth of nine kilometres 109 kilometres east of New Caledonia Ilanter at 1.26 p.m. (at 4.26 p.m. after Latvia), the U.S. Geology Research Centre announced.
The Cunami Pacific alert centre indicated that there is currently no warning or recommendation regarding possible tsunami threats to the region.
"The earthquakes in this region are not unusual, as it is known, nor have they been unusual in recent years," said Seismologist Fils Kamins, the research center of Geoscience Australia.
It could potentially be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I doubt it is so powerful to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in "Fire Bay" - the Pacific Tectonic Area, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to the opening of the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open checkpoints at the borders of the two countries, which were closed a year ago following the Venezuelan initiative, the Presidents of Colombia and Venezuela, Juan Manuel Santos and Nikolas Maduro, told on Thursday.
The initial border points will be open only to pedestrians.
Starting on Saturday, five border points will be opened every day from 8 to 20 hours.
It will be possible to open borders for transport once certain cross-border agreements on security, trade and energy have been concluded, the Presidents have indicated.
Maduro was forced to close the border in August in response to the attack by Colombian fighters on Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured in this attack.
In July this year, Venezuelan unilaterally opened the border twice because of the economic crisis - the Venezuelans who came to poverty tried to break through the border in order to buy the first needed goods at the border shops.
This edition was used by 200,000 Venezuelans.

Facebook bids fight-advertising blockers.
The most popular social network in the world Facebook has broadcast a warning shooter, making it clear that blocking advertising banners using special tools is not acceptable and that users will also have to watch advertisements.
The popularity of special blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is directly advertising will decrease.
Facebook has now made it known that you understand the harmful nature of advertising banners, but users will also have to live with them.
True, they will be provided with tools to choose for themselves what type of material they are shown, the BBC reports.
"As we provide people with more and more control opportunities, we will also start to show advertisements to those using advertising blocking software," said Andrø Bosvort, Vice-President of Facebook advertising business.
In other words, users will be able to choose what kind of advertising they see by selecting brands and sectors that seem interesting to them.
"People don't like to see advertisements that don't belong to them or interfere with content enjoyment," Bosvort added.
Advertising blocking tools in mobile devices do not usually work, from which Facebook receives the largest visit, but their reduction in banner exposure is also measured in billion terms.
According to BBC information, some 200 million people are used as blockers.
It has already been reported that in the previous quarter of the business year Facebook revenues from advertising amounted to $6.2 billion, or €5.55 billion.
It should be said that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their news streams.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just begun to act to remove or at least limit the headlines behind which are actually "empty" news.

Drivers must take into account limited traffic at this stage and the time spent by the road.
The municipality calls on the authorities to deal with the restrictions imposed and to comply with the traffic organisation's rules.

She explained that during the meeting you were talking about the abolition of sanctions for fish processors, as well as the Injukalna gas tank.
The meeting, contrary to diplomatic practice, has taken place without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The organizer of the meeting was Ambassador Alexander Vešnjakov of Russia.

This month, the National Police (VP) Anti-Economic Crime Management (ENAP) for a total of 130 thousand returnees from a Riga commercial company detained bookkeepers who worked in the company for 20 years, BNS informed the agency of the VP representative, Gita Gjibovska.
The current information shows that the suspected woman has committed illegal activities for several years and has committed more than EUR 130 000 of serious losses to the company together.
In view of the fact that the company’s officials had not followed the cash flow closely and had entrusted their employees, they only learned about the current operations after several years.
VP ENAP policemen arrested this month the woman of the suspected birth in 1963 and committed harassment in the company.
In the context of the incident, criminal proceedings for arrest have been initiated if done to a large extent.

In Estonia, nine people were exposed to Zika’s virus antibodies.
Nine people will be analysed in Estonia by Zika virus antibodies, which means that they may have been in contact with this infection, reports the Estonian public radio organisation ERR.
Information provided by the laboratory shows that this year Zika virus tests were performed for 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been identified in Finland and Sweden in the neighbouring countries of Estonia.
Estonia's health management data show that no acute cases of Zika's infection have been registered in the country and that in case of flu-like symptoms, people should not carry out a Zika's virus test, but they should contact their family doctor.
We have found IgG (Immunoglobulin G class) antibodies that show that the person to be checked has been infected at some point with Zika or similar virus.
"It doesn't mean that the patient is infected with Zika's virus," explained the head of the Synlab infection department Pauls Nábers.
Zikas virus is a genus of the "Aedes" Odyssey.
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of quality car purchases, in an interview with the agency BNS said Auto Association Vice President Ingus Rutišn.
In the car sector, whether there are alleged problems with dumping prices, Rutīs replied as confirmed.
Of course.
Car purchases are both different from service purchases where handling at prices is easier.
The final result of the car must be paid in any case as it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Either the advertiser of the purchase is incompetent or cannot establish a quality purchase, as a result, even often not aware of it, "buys".
"Does the very well-informed purchase be built in such a way as to get something specific, and then there are all the wonders there," said the Vice-President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous offer as a criterion for determining the winner of the purchase, but in part the public still has a misconception about these things.
Now it is very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria must be established in both cases and, when taken into account and evaluated, the decision shall be taken on a case-by-case basis.
The technical criteria for qualitative procurement should be very precise and market-friendly.
However, points should not evaluate anything that can be expressed in terms of money.
Points should not assess fuel consumption, emissions, services and similar matters.
Jazina is the expected life cycle of the car, the journey, etc., then also all together can be simply counted.
"The question then is only where of the scenarios is the customer's interest?" explained Rutīs.
On the other hand, the Head of the Auto Association projects Peter Rubulis noted that the problems are related to the fact that often the same person makes purchases for both cars and for work and food and these purchases are derived from one sample.
We have also brought to our consultation the spare parts of the procurement sample, which was difficult to describe otherwise than as a detailed absurdity.
"The problem is that the buyer very often lacks any understanding of the subject of the purchase and the requirements are simply copied from somewhere," said Rubulis.
Rutīns added - the smaller the structure that announces the purchase, the more problems there may be.
"It is apparently precisely because there is a lack of human resources and competences," said the Vice-President of the Associations.

"The Answer" accuses "suicide unit" of stealing style.
On Thursday, the South African group Die Antwerp accused Suicid Sqaud of using the group's unique look without permission, calling the respected director "small hair-sucking".
The group's lead singer Jolandi on the mobile app Instagram addressed the film director Warner Bros, saying, "That's right, David Ajer, you're driving our style."
As she claims, the movie stars of the War of Delavinia and Jared Leto have told you that Airs was yours in the filming field.
"But you didn't ask permission to deceive us," said the singer.
A 31-year-old musician claims that her group member Ninja (Ninja) would briefly turn to Ajera on this issue, but he "did not answer anything, as such a small one would be afraid of food".
Jolandi points out that Airs has taken off the screen since 2011 the short film "Umshini Wam" introductory film, which shows the South African hyphen duet.
She has also published a video that proves that Ayers Joker and Harley Queen have left both singers.
Leto himself insists that the inspired image of Joker is based on the image of the hand musician David Bowie.
Jolandi concludes his claim by voting in favour of the strong criticism of the film’s performance.
In real terms, Jolandi and Ninja, Anří du Tuata and Vatican Tudor Jones, gained fame with three rap studio entries, promoting the African 'Zef' counterculture.

Turkey is looking for missing diplomats
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who did not return after the roundup on 15 July with the retired staff.
Foreign Minister Mevits Čavushogl said on Friday that, from the workplaces around the world, 208 Turkish ministers were withdrawn from Ankara for the roundup period, and 32 have been missing "without permission".
About 18,000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their office in Turkey, considering them to be loyal officials of the United States of America, Fetul Gulen, whom it accuses in the development of a government's production plan.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is one of Turkey’s most sought-after people.
Kavosoglu said the US Department of Justice team will visit Turkey later this month to discuss its possible release.
This issue has become a problem in relations with Turkey, NATO Member State.
The US opposed the strong armaments tactics of Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan after the roundup, and Turkey responded to it in an effort to establish closer ties with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that Turkish military attachhes in Greece had fled to Italy, the attachhes in Kuwait tried to flee to Saudi Arabia, but were sent back, and two Generals from Afghanistan were arrested in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two Bangladeshi officials fled to New York, and one of the Russians went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryjet, quoting military sources, reported that the loss is also Turkey's military attaché in Jordan.
Wall Street Journal, quoting the US official who is aware of this situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based in the command centre in Virginia has sought asylum in the United States.

Olympics organizers are trying to clear the green-colored swimming pool
The Olympics, which were scheduled for training on Friday, arrived at the closed pool, as organizers needed more time to clean green water before the first individual competitions in the Rio Olympics.
The water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, in the midst of a synchronised dive competition.
The organizers claimed that the water competition was safe even after the larger pool next to the water pool and the synchronised swimming also had a light green color.
The dive was not yet possible when the athletes arrived at the morning heat, although the pool was finally opened 13.00 after local time - only 2 1/2 hours before the women’s 3 meters competition.
The water color looked closer to its normal color, yet still with green color.
An American named Ebia Johnstone, who competes for thramplin, reported that she came to the heat just to find out that the pool was closed without any warning.
She wrote on her tweet that "#FixTheSwamp (save the powder) should be fashionable.
British kidneyer Tom Dellius, who cut off the bronze in the synchronous dive of the platform, also commented on the status of the pool on Twitter.
It is hoped that this means that we have not been as bad as we were in the last days!
Mario Andrada, the head of the local organizers committee, stressed that the pool of competitions is safe by giving green light to the 3 meters foreclosures.
He agreed that some sportsmen were disturbed by water, but he said that it was the result of the cleaning efforts of the pool.
"We repeat many times what we have said all the time - water does not in any way endanger the health of athletes," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they were close to the eye.
This was the result that the first reaction, when we saw the water becoming green, was using one of the chemicals - chlorine - that is used very often in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the quantity.
We rechecked the water, and it fully responded to the parameters.
Simons Langford, the main spokesman of the Maria Lenka Water Sports Centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision supports the world leader organization FINA (International Swimming Federation).
"The reason is that the water has to be calm so that the pool can get back to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the pool situation had surprised the unplanned organizers.
"Chemical isn't exactly science," he said.
Some things, as you can see, lengthen.
In the last few days, getting the rains of water in a normal state has made it even more difficult.
"It doesn't matter," Andrada said.
He added that early in the morning there were dry workouts available, but he acknowledged that it was "not ideal."
He explained that the pool’s color change was due to an elevated alkaline level, similar to the aquarium water can become green if not adequately monitored.
When we started doing something green to prevent color, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We cannot use too much chemicals in water, because athletes are training," Andrada said.
We certainly could have done better at first so as not to allow the water to become green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.

Shanghai, Taipei, despite the suspension of cross-border communication, however, a forum will be held
However, Shanghai and Taipei will hold an annual city forum from 22 to 23 August in Taipei, on Friday the Shanghai municipality announced, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
This High-level Municipal Officer, Mr. Hailins Shanghai, will lead the delegation represented in the forum in his official microblog account, Sina Weibo, by the Government of Shanghai.
The forums have been held in the order of rotation of both cities since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on the exchange of experience in areas such as health care, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking to "enhance the exchange of experience and cooperation in various aspects", as the Government of Shanghai reports.
The Taiwanese side has not accepted the 1992 agreement to strengthen the Chinese principle since the new leader Tsai Ing-vens took office in May, resulting in a suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Xiaoguangs , a national council spokesman for the Taiwan case, said on Friday that a peaceful cross-border relationship could exist while the Taiwanese party remained at the political foundations of the 1992 agreement.
"We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experience between cities of both sides," the MA said, stressing that the nature of cross-border relations and the exchange of experience between cities should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan President meets with Chinese Foreign Minister, hopes for closer cooperation
On Thursday, in meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Ji, Ugandan President Joveni thanked China for its long-standing support for Uganda's development and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China is a sensible friend of Uganda and Africa who supported the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and later supported Africa’s economic and social development.
The president mentioned the construction of the Zambian railway in the 1970s as proof of China's generous support, even when China itself had not been particularly fed.
Museveni said that China has implemented multilateral cooperation with Uganda by investing in infrastructure and business as well as cultural exchange, and added that such cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than mere financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to engage in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and the construction of industrial parks.
He also invites the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and travel it.
Wang Ji praised Uganda's activities in the fields of industrialization and agricultural modernisation and added that China will continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner for Uganda's cooperation.
Vangs stated that China is prepared to do everything possible to help implement Uganda's economic and social development, and added that China and Uganda's cooperation is true and without any political considerations, because it is based on high-level political credibility and time-tested friendship.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda in building infrastructure and industrial parks, as well as support the development of the energy and agricultural sectors of this East African people.
