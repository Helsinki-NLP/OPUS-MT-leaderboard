Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament, as part of an amendment to criminal law, refused the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
Members refused, secondly, the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the currently imprisoned former Prime Minister.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having entered into an unfavourable priori agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
Judgment is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko described the regime's political vengeful judgment and caused a process of bias of the court also in the west.
The draft repealing paragraph 365 of the Criminal Law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan won
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already won.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As usual in the region, the winners of the elections are Islamists, but they are moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary right of the Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a flight, we cut off our hands.
Women can forget the emancipation, the possible disrespect of the faith are subject to capital punishment...
It is the Koran that will unite, instead of the dictator's personality, the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order that we cannot represent it and that we would certainly not love it.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamic warriors have accepted help with appreciation for the infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it's not an American general who led NATO's hits, but rather Allah, whom they celebrated the greatness of each attack.
So when it comes to finding the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly deal with Libya.
There is therefore no problem for the premises to get rid of the "cross".
Is it that oil companies will have easy access to Libya's black gold without land?
Perhaps not as much as the West may ultimately boast of a disinterested protection of human rights.
We don't know how to stop these Charia fans.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the focus of investors.
A turnaround of statistics took place on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states has published GDP-related information for 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The mandatory market beats all the records.
Investors look not only at Italy but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other countries of Europe have published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France's GDP by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better placed than expected (growth of 0.3 per cent instead of 0.1 per cent planned), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (it was the issue of the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy has had 1.5 per cent growth during the third quarter.
However, GDP has stagnated and, according to the Office of Czech Statistics, it is confirmed that economic growth is gradually declining.
The results are worse than the predictions of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy had a 1.5% growth during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5% according to the planned and recalculated data.
The euro area economy and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what the analysts had foreseen.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2%.
Performance on obligations over ten years is 28.45%
The performance of the obligations of Spain and Italy is rising to critical limits.
Problems start to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The performance of the Czech obligations remains below 4 per cent, while the situation in the region is deteriorating.
Voice calls in Germany to say that the ECB should be the last instance guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football performance has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won with Super Cech and Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also made a good deal of money in the second part and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of chance for the second part.
The Czech performance also won thanks to Super Czech and Heroes Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification at the European Championship.
The mountains were under pressure until the second part due to precise Czech defence.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who ran two chances of marking a goal.
And thanks to Super Petr Czech, Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition to a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
In the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams found it difficult to build combinations and the game focused mainly on the central line.
The pressure of national footballers has not been able to defeat the Czech defence, which has responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students went to pray in the afternoon before the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Spanish universities have created a human shield Tuesday around the Spanish nuclear technology centre where uranium is transformed.
They thus made it clear that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
A possible attack by Iranian nuclear facilities is reported in Israel.
The students went to pray in the afternoon before the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: don't take breakfast and take caraway to dinner
Over one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolworkers are overweight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with a poor lifestyle.
This shows again the importance of the environment in which the human being evolves and the models surrounding it.
Obese children's tables include, for example, 50% more cartoonism than in children's families with normal weight.
19% of the obese had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with a sensitization action "Obsity is not a coincidence"
In the small families, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last year of school and participated in 900 primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "obesity is not a coincidence", supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning it has been more than 12,000 students from sixth to third who have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight children, even obese, is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the children in question indicate, for example, 5 times a day breakfast-in case - breakfast-taste-dining, which is a basic principle of good food," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and breakfast for dinner
Experts draw attention to the fact that to have healthy development, some basic details such as a small family breakfast at the same time are needed.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of students eat at the same time.
In most families each has its own breakfast.
And the worst thing that has been found is that a tenth of the population does not eat at all at breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that the families of obese children are more likely to consume bad fry.
Almost every student - without talking about the weight - drinks every day of sweet drinks (70%).
More than 40% of the children in question do sports regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age are far from ideal for healthy food."
Among their favorite dishes there are lots of cake, meat and sugar.
"The most alarming is, among other things, a great preference for sweet lemons," is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want any feces at all and the preference for fish and vegetables meals was very low.
Head of Health
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of an inspection of a group of participants in the investigation who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obsity is not a coincidence", we were given a definite will to go to healthy food," the results of the investigation indicated.
The most striking was, for example, in the case of sweet lemons because children started giving preference to drinking water.
The children most often herded white meat and fish as the main dish on the questionnaire and would reduce sugar dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, professionals say
In a presentation on how to learn for the stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there was a lot of it from the start.
I wasn't thinking about what was going to happen next.
The exhibitions of three professionals in the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is going on in place.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to final reviews and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are Saturdays and Sundays classes, it's really drunk.
This time we have with Director Alenka (in which there is no boy) treated how to dress a woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist needs to know how to visually reduce large arms, extend a tail or add the necessary curves.
We have thus come to beautifully highlight the character and also not to dress too visually of women's types such as Jennifer Lopez with strong breasts and pronounced hooks and fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and the hooks in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth making.
And you won't regret it because the clothes that fall unappreciably are invaluable.
In a custom-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slips permanently, enrolls and does not hold on to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance they can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of knitted fabric, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of different appearances and I am happy that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid of what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each trainee receives a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality fashion and its appearance.
I should "dress"Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know the secret of Victoria from the campaign.
Deep down, it makes me happy, because it's better than wearing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred kilos in recent times (don't take my statement, svp, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only clothes physics but also creates the productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphic artist, has been entertaining us about all this.
But this... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three specialty guests gave a diverse aspect at the Saturday meeting filled out information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one suit in a different way.
The variability is for this primary example.
For example, this coat-coat that must be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but it can also wear the naked body, with scarves and take it as a picture as a dress.
Or it's enough to raise the sleeves or the collar and have a new look immediately.
"Play with this" he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then begin to violate it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more clothing options than those that are photographed.
That is, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I have to be ready to "retail" at least one fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than actually.
We must count on this during a model creation.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half of our success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It is enough to look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing made it a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of stylists remains frugal.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough that I know something but what I seem to pass to second grade).
And if someone makes a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he probably tells us a completely different size (more small) than he actually has.
Then we'll just go on Google and make sure that the bubbled information reports about the celebrity in question, whether it's ugly or big, etc.
Honza and Mario put us on the heart Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to go in the fashion and know how to assemble models.
He needs to communicate with the people he's wearing and it's so important to be a good psychologist.
To guess people, not to flatter themselves, to keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his closet and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, "My God, what a horror!"
"You'll find some things you'll find nice and advise him on what to carry with them," said Mario.
He showed us exactly what everything should contain what is called the "placovka" or the stylist bag.
That's what you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to the things clearly defined as cissors, depilation rolls or even food pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of graffiti are not usable because they could trim the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we are not only people who listen but who have tried something practically they have taught us how to look properly like shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the seed could fall to the fortiori on the back.
And that's how we got together and got together.
We did not have the right to touch the scars so as not to hurt ourselves by inadvertently.
It is therefore really necessary to have powers.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me for my creation.
The account I'm reporting isn't for my friend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend course
I'm starting to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed Le Run competes across America.
Revision
At the beginning, a smooth race is transformed due to a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift to work.
It fills everyone's ambition to a certain extent, but it does nothing if no one wants to do anything else.
The new sub-titled part The Run produced great expectations before its exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the already-old Need for Speed race series and get out some kind of game from the players that wouldn't just count on points.
So we were wondering how the ragged passages during which the main hero got out of his car and did what he wanted.
As this is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole is pulling down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible fenetism on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're in the adventure with Jack's main hero and he's got problems and he's got to take part in illegal races across America.
You're sitting behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that are quite distinct and interesting.
The player doesn't have the feeling one moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful, even though the technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
It's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are more and more time-consuming of an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you will find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition, the various races are well organized behind each other.
There is only a small number but that's enough.
There are moments ago you try to exceed the number of opponents requested (like in a classic race) and then you run against the watch (classic duel with the timer) and then you are still waiting for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time, you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
Newness is the passage out of the vehicle.
Rather, it's an interactive animation when most of Jack's time runs out in front of someone and you have to help him by hitting the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this kind than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, it is good as it is because this element is not likely to generate and places itself, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that there is nothing extraordinary at present, but one cannot say that it is negative.
As for the real simulation, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although it is possible to find better in competition, the model of conduct works very well with the type of designing of races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after some time.
In contrast to the model of conduct, that of collisions is not yet in progress.
We don't expect this game to be a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, the least idea of how your car behaves, so it's not completely good.
During the closed crossings you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car is part of volleyball.
Or he's in the middle of nowhere.
Thanks to the restart system it's not really a problem but it really upsets you.
The restart is made so that when you have broken the figure or you are out in the decor the game brings you back at the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the route piece in question.
The big hip of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be passed in a certain way if that does not happen.
Otherwise you will meet on a given location of "civil" vehicles still in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What angers you are are the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you need to either stand aside and stop them or stop them.
It's the same if you go before him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the situation it always gets close to your nose.
The opponents still have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This angers the most at the end of the game when you roll on a long inverse bridge.
The opponent must pass before you at all costs.
When it passes before you it hides the view of other inverse vehicles and you stumble a lot of times.
We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's bad because through a simple behavior model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of races is like there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is to change the car during the race.
You have to be careful about the fuel pumps on the routes as you can change the car there, however, most of the time that you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big American cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars at exotic attors on very technical routes such as lacquer roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about the adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, different objects begin to unlock:
This one connects online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult hits to understand is the situation of the last race of adventure.
You arrive with your car in the metro tunnel (it looks like) where you are in the dark on the roads (it looks like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (priority) and behind you comes a metro branch that sends you the car directly to the railway.
At the drafting we had a discussion for a few days whether someone really thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really took us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is usually nice and in some cases really great.
What is embarrassing is that in more extreme situations, imagination does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is optional.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young public, a new soundtrack has been created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: So the Run is really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes, we could say without fear that it's the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it's not over.
Entertainment is really good, but be prepared to see the flaws in your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Embassy near the European Union:
Czechs behave like negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically abolished the balance between the institutions"
"I wasn't expecting such a hard war."
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," that is, Miléna Vicenova began her presentation to the Faculty of Law of the Czech Embassy near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the different bodies of the EU and their relations so comprehensible and visible, to the extent that a large number of speakers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University could send it, she showed how much she took her motto "understandable and open about Europe" very seriously.
Madame Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that he is tired, that he is a round-the-clock, that he cannot fulfill any mission, and I have to say that he has cut the blow to the whole world because he holds his role in perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to 27 Member States, communicate well with them and have a clear vision of the direction to be taken from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of a response to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the unity and greater readability of the Union's state policy, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our syrecky (cooked cheese that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda she has lived, lived and will live in the European Council in a short time.
She qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis, or organised a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It qualified for the fall of very negative government and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to Madame L'Ambassadrice, "activities have fought their full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve now.
In addition, the Union's new seven-year budget needs to be approved, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and cost-effective, which sector will have priority, which countries will be the most assisted, at least everything is to be resolved in future negotiations.
Mrs. Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an comprehensible Europe".
"I really don't like the abbreviations, the foreign words, the jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or round corneas, bananas are quite large, or no one has forbidden us to make syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe at multiple speeds awaits us
According to the Embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Furthermore, it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
According to her, there were several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, it then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what are you still doing in this Visegrad group?' and it's not quite content.
In the near future, according to Madame Vicenova, these are new hard rules for budgetary policy that await member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if it is not at multiple speeds, which requires rather than a 'new European Federation'.
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
First of all, he said that the countries that want it and those who do not want it do not cooperate with each other."
"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a really two-speed Europe," expects Madame Vicenova.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye's mission to determine the basis on which all topics having an impact on the EU should be debated between all EU members and not just members of the euro area.
History of a brand:
The IBM Innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone was to look for the vocabulary that expresses the closest to the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term".
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm feeling as it is today and since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved as soon as people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the impression that the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of the culture of the company's care developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived for a hundred years because she remained faithful to its basic values and yet was not afraid to change all around her.
This has enabled us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will arrive even more"has delayed for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A Well - Prepared System
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only among the first American employees to have paid holidays, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-designed system of rewards for inventors and traders.
In the same way IBM has a system of relationships with the well-developed client.
The company was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talents – as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is fully in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano with the head of IBM.
It has been working with IBM for 30 years and currently holds the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
Over the past few years IBM has done what is called jamy, brain-storming online from what has resulted in many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that provides it with a secure position in the business field.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Economic Professor at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technological firm but a firm that helps solve business world problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the Great Blue, as it is commonly called in the United States in terms of its slogan - has grown to one of the largest companies in the world.
This is, of course, the most versatile technological firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, services of the Council at the level of the server's products to nanotechnology.
She has many patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among its discoveries are the ticket distributor, payment card, financial swap, bar code or floppy disk.
IBM was the second largest technology firm in terms of market capitalization (the first Apple) with $220 billion this year, when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Advanced Overview
These are not all the innovations and manufactures that have been preferred by the client and the time - IBM, for example, failed the bet on an own OS/2 operating system, the Prodige online service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot emotionally hang on to the past," notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor who is at the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
A Perspective Technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for one-fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
In 1990, however, it was with more than the strongest hardware participation motive.
From the year 2000, IBM sold low-income assets for $15 billion, during which period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues to invest, even from 2008, when it for the first time exceeded the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who also increased its investment volume during the great economic crisis.
Did it appear now that IBM is going through the current crisis without worrying?
The price of the IBM action has increased from 2008 to 120 per cent, and the net profit of the company continues to grow.
The logo of the company IBM is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to control other crises.
History of IBM: From pieces of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially a brand used by a firm's branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is related to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the old "points", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the Society's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then made the shadow to the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that so far rely on the identity and culture of society.
Watson was running the firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - cheese and meat trays up to the registered boxes.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the number of business increased to $9 million and began to expand throughout the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership, his son took over the board of directors, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and IBM computers helped NASA drive flights to the cosmos - on Wednesday, Saturn and in 1969 on the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with a high value added.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the last three years - is the concept of Smarter Planet "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make smart use of technology in areas that have not yet been exploited, such as urban transport and management.
With regard to trade, IBM has recently developed a Smarter Trade platform that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a global research and development team that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtaraova about her unfaithful husband:
If you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtaraova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychttar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and loved by Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still expected Joseph to wake up from her pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtaraova explained.
When Darina Rychtaraova gave summer asylum to Bartosova in her home, she did not doubt that her husband would not.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days on moving from Rican, Pepa did not give up the singer.
And he knew in public that he loved him.
In time, Darina resigned, accepted her husband's relationship and ended by saying good-bye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her at the door of the house.
"It's the biological father of my son and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will throw him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," he left filter Rychtaraova showing that she was separated from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife put in a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we are completely normal but we're not sleeping together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtaraova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she's going, with whom and if she has a relationship.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to "get them out of their way".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of female vices that can pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchases
Does your half make you notice that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy yourself at least one dress a week?
Are you happy to buy and by parcels at the time of balances?
In your case, you can talk about purchases like a vice.
Some women believe that they should restrict their desire to make purchases.
But you will say, who would resist the velvet-out of clothing stores, to look for yourself beautiful clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting for the entrance...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I'd need to chew at least 5 kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yeah?
You are therefore part of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
The strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and women become poisoners.
Odre and purity in the first place
It's like a fine handle.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, dust the bathroom - and that's twice a week.
Do you make any comments to your partner that he walks with salt feet on his own ground, to the children that he has taken out the washbasin, cremated the glass of the living room, and what does that give you a lot of work?
If you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and purity should not be the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can damage your relationship and even family peace.
The work of the know-how
"Put this overcoat used in the trash."
"Are you going to put on these old shoes tomorrow?"
"A wet maid has nothing to do with earth."
If you do this work on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really decompose it.
It's obvious that you don't think bad you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to do so much soap work...
The defamation, the periphery
The defamation, persilation, but also the insults against someone are also the property of certain women.
Women are particularly involved in relations and thus are happy to deal with issues such as, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us can escape a little harmless persifliation here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a particular feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persist, even despise others and are for their surroundings - especially at work in a community of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The striking hockey player Jagr has twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL's Monday game on Caroline's ice and is once again the head of the Czech productive players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still took a step further and was appointed the best player of the game, he marked in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagger also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagger after the match will tell the foreign-Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the match he'd give his hat trick."
"I heard it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you" explained Jagger after his action Giroux marks a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later, there was a second attack on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes for the palette and presented it to Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belongs to the Flyers.
Especially in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagger he marks three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the three best," Jagar said about his center.
"I never thought I'd end up playing with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years in the NHL the other team players have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a Tuom Ruutu goal and again Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read didn't get away with any other complications that ended up two against one.
"Proger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the palette, I got off the speed and (Read) left towards the most distant corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the last goal of the game from his point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory in the head of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montréal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he left in the second third due to injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defender whose advance of two goals lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
This is the fact that the back line was sick, which was mostly the local coach rather than the lost points because they only played the game with 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement has not been enough and we have not been able to resist."
"We just wanted to simplify the game, push the palette out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P.K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the thirtieth attack on Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in uax goals of the Jets, which arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a tendency for the west and the journeys to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually in Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed an invitation letter if the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered to travel to the West, however, it was necessary to row all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it wasn't won yet.
The agreement for the currency that was the condition to travel west was denied to people "politically wrong" who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the monetary agreement (western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs most often spent their vacations in the country where there were many country houses and chalets that the Czechs had bought, and this habit is still hard.
The journeys of the Czechs have been a major revolution since 1989.
Although holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum until 1989, the Czechs spent 4 million days abroad in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of that time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in the neighbouring countries of the West caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't travel by plane west for a long time that everyone wanted to see for at least one moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our incomes did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical course of a Czech trip was at this time to bring with him his own food canned, sauce, etc.... to save.
Another important moment has also been the interchangeability of the Czech crown that finally allowed our tourists after decades of free access to Western currency.
Our standard of living, as well as the average wage, have increased what has caused another important moment around 1997.
With an increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have since 1997 begun to prepare tours with air charter connections that through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to previous ones.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had no visa-free links with almost most of the developed countries around the world outside the EU, which later facilitated our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year of direct air charters, Czech tourists have been taking to distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to move fully into the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad, including the attached charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end with a situation without a solution "a pact"
Nearly 5 months ago, the Czech football is without a President and he risks that Ivan Hasek's successor to the Czech Republic's Football Association will not be known after a General Assembly to be held in Nymburg on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting rules should be made.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rijkl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paklik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called for his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead the football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football come back to differences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House in Prague, as the negotiations remained blocked and there was even no question of dealing with the way in which they were elected.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, does it appear, the statutory representatives or also the full-power investment officials.
In this single point, there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue with regard to the electoral regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which, in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not contributed to the situation
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the neurologic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into bed.
"The difference apple is based on the following: either to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," noted one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Association of the Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, who represents the professional football within the Association.
According to the rules of the model envisaged, the third round will be the one of the candidates who received the highest percentage vote in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready to retire to win the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from the two chambers.
And the Czech party is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the vote.
"Only this would cause the idea of two previous rounds to be lost and would completely deny the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, which understands the objections of the Moravian Party and which would be best not to change the rules and vote in accordance with the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paklik also agrees even if he considers that the electoral regulations established under the most favourable status Pelta among all candidates.
"I wish that we shall vote to the maximum in accordance with the statutes of the Association."
"Because there is not yet any ideas that a representative imagined as in the past General Assembly," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who is a candidate for the first time and who has been defined in his statements especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, there will be a new President in Nymburg and he believes that candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification at today's European Championship should calm everyone down."
"The football will again be on a happiness wave and there will be more training for cooperation" added Jablonec's officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in managing both professional and regional football.
Rachel is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This can again cause a lockdown at the General Assembly."
"I hope as much as the healthy reason will win," said Rijkl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement with all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but which can say whether the entire football board will be complete for the game.
The particularly fast-paced flight to Podgorica, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rijkl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to bring a part of the executive committee on the field of reprisals.
Finally, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister for Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the disbanded parties within the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state staffing, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sport Union, which must determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik is going to fight for the President's position because he doesn't see any right candidate.
If the head of footballers of Plzen Tomas Paklik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to all that he requested for a new president of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation, it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paklik told the Czech Press Agency (TCK).
Paklik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rijkl to just try to prevent Pelta from entering the head of the AFRT that would be given priority for this election.
Paclik also stresses that if he won the election, he would hold this position as President only until 2013 planned for a General Assembly.
It would look good in function an experienced and high-level manager but not connected to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"It was terrible for me when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at the time."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said above all to be the shame of Paklik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of the football team of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man who is known as a lobbyist who can influence the vote of the delegates of the General Assembly.
It is not acceptable for Paklik to assume this position of President Pelta.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-voltage trader, it would be even less favourable to football," said Paklik.
What is still shocking is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during the hearings in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta came out without a penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paklik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes president, I sell the Plzen club."
In the event that Paclik would triumph on Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rijkl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September that had ended by a failure, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"He's a great man."
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as manager of the Association, he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," said Paklik, who in September drew great attention when he took a decision to cancel the Arbitral Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Palik claims he would be at the level to run the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private companies and he has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated his victory in the first division with his support last May.
"I have the strength to make something change in the world of sport and to bring it some culture."
"I would hold back the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to bad taste situations," Paklik added, who did not achieve his antipathy for Spartan leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose power of lobbying with high-level policies would result in more money for sports tax on games.
"It is one of the key points that the new President should address."
"When it comes to gambling tax as stated by the political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paklik does not take his current relationship with Plzen's club as something negative even if he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonec and Rijkl with Dukla de Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I don't see why I'm forwarding my actions from the Plzen Club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paklik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT which should put an end to state-of-the-art situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that if he was elected, AFRT would have new statutes that should put an end to the questions about the electoral regulations in the future.
Jablonec's official is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks today's success of the football performance should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election, which had not been carried out, promised just to dedicate herself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and waiting for a President to be there on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily connected to the Jablonec club, has worked a large number of years in Sparta and the Union's Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there is a euphoria that ruled in Ivan Hasek's time.
"Cursed at the June General Assembly of Statutes were approved that were not perfect as everyone saw."
"If there were no such interpretations, we would have already had a President since September," he said.
It is precisely the review of the most important document of the civic association that has taken full account of delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am willing to take all the responsibility for it if it does not work."
"It is a principle that we cannot exist without," Pelta added.
Then he strives, we say, not to confront his opponents.
He stated earlier that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his legal training and that he knew that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has not attacked Tonas Palik for a long time, which, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and he's already had some success."
"His attacks were not more honorable, however, and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said at the address of her opponent, but he says, "remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September."
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to national representation.
It's supposed to be a football vitrine.
"And I would also try to finish all the business that begins with the Bohemian one or the result of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for all football," the Czech Press Agency TKK said the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of the football would not lead to any change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he said in Strahov where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburg for anything.
"If there is only one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and will only get it when there's a new leader at its head," as Pelta optimizingly states two days before the day is probably decisive for her career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his direction, AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President, Jindrich Rajchl, had been elected new president of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday, this would not please a large number of people, he seemed.
However, Rijkl promises that in the event that he is elected we will start working hard.
He wants to make systematic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, contribute more money to football and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying I'm gonna do this all alone," said Rijk in an interview for CTC.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member can deal with a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions to make football a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will start to work hard rather than criticize others" he added.
He stated, it was said, that he would not be a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth the shot and if I have people behind me who will constantly put me in the wheels and issue doubts about each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have said to me anyway that I must not give up because they would also give up."
"This is a trust that I can't betray," he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years, there's been a great deal of work and I don't want to let it fall."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them." he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union would not return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and this is something Mirek Pelta can't do."
" Behind him are people who would make football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen."
"You can blame me for a number of things, but you certainly can't bear someone."
"I'm trying to be a target."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he reaffirms that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm ready to do as much for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts by one Czech and the other Moravia whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation like at present with only three moral teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paklik, president of the Plzen Club, has entered the competition for the position of President, Rijkl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech Chamber who has elected me as Vice President and knows that with me there will be success," said Rijkl, who plans among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, negotiations on contracts with televisions and on the game law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common mistake for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paklik is a strong candidate who has what to offer to football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he had been elected, he would certainly continue in what has been started by Hasek and would not make significant changes among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to ruin his success," said Rijkl, who evaluated his rivers.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
De Julia Stanek
Ovni-like paratroopers, magnificent Budapest swimming pools: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in gas baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the best of well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there was an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his bathrobe.
Stretched over her back in the water, she observed the artisticly arranged domes, and was swimming against the Putten marbles that were waiting for her from the other side of the pool and was not short of admiring the Metically restored New Art of these converted pools.
If a indoor pool made him happy, she noticed in her book all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building without delay.
More than 200 swimming pools have been investigated in this way by the Meder architecture historian and she has presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain"). Munich's municipal indoor swimming pools, historical bathrooms in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She has travelled to the most exceptional bathrooms in central Europe in 13 countries. Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real fertilizer of the culture of the bathroom.
Meder, she explains that she has little interest in sports but she feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It's annoying that the swimmers should be content to contemplate blue squares and be comfortable with Javel's water weight while the joggers breathe from the scent of espresso forests or can listen to the gasulent birds of the park.
"I was wondering one day why the pools must be so late," said the nun.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The water surface doubles the architecture
A dive in a pool and volatile sauna oils - a well-being factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight to the eyes: "In the swimming rooms, instead of a floor, we have a water surface."
"It is transparent on one side, but reflects on the other side, however, the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are presented in a double way: high-vessels, multicolored tiles, trampling.
The small image size of "Badefreuden" makes a report worth 190 pages of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - he certainly wants to make a jump in the blue.
The Meder collector discovered remarkable copies during his research in Hungary.
Alongside beautiful wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermals whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zürich bath we have the whole city to its eyes, we can admire the Arlberg nestled from an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits the swimmers in Langenfeld: The Dome Ötztal Aqua resembles an OVNI that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, the steam rises from the three open plates, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the scent of Javel's water does not come from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate from a sulphur smell, from Arpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder was also disappointed: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and in full air from Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricade.
The bathroom designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
By taking a look out of the New Art building window in red and white, she observed the spread of the bad grasses between the squares.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only of the neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its design in 1844 but still a mature Alhambra-style hall that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the expert in the pool, Iris Meder - and not just because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good performance to merge construction styles so different in such a tremendous unit," Meder says.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look into the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the group leader then wanted to draw on the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, it is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as maize and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions continue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Force survey on the organization of foodwatch consumers.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann stresses in this article that the speculation of the Global Stock Exchanges pushes prices upwards and that banks share a complicity with global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at the head of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts share the view that the couples have given up their bids and ask - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism of US competitors differently: He promises to investigate the complaints and says, "No case is worth putting into practice the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE's information, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report charges.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with a recommendation, as usual.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the raw materials market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how far today's banks are harming the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must delete all the investments in its portfolio for which money has been invested on food speculation," Bode said.
"That doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's a question of hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may appear to be surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the group's PDG wants to present a perfect image a few months before leaving its functions.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything that is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about.
One in two would resolve the investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the survey Tuesday, with which on 7 and 8 November, the Institute of Forsa conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just 11 per cent found that it was legitimate that Deutsche Bank offered investments for which the price of food bets were made.
Many bank clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one of the two would, following the survey, resolve all investments for which money is injected into speculation on raw materials.
43 per cent would advise such a bank around them, 49 per cent replied that they would reflect on the resolution of their accounts to change banking.
21st House in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the Brussels World Exhibitions in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened and is held as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, glass hangars, its vivid and daring lengths and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion has been awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture up to our day.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent ball-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
His flag project as a temporary construction was exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the South Vienna station, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - not walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly loose.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, he now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedère Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance in every respect.
The new start was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedère.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among other things in his youth as an artist's painter, then at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founder of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she particularly carried out the transformation work of political men and the protection of monuments, obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established the operation.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name were exhibited there, a coffee and a library are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
Krischanitz was therefore the perfect interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and extended with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practicely every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: "the building was "an energy frenzy", says Krischanitz.
The profiles of glass facade windows were changed, the insulated glass reinforced in glass fibres was placed and the roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been refurbished.
Two basements have made the place to the new operation, a light panel tamped between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge led to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but always the light Pavilion Schwanzer.
The outer doors of origin remain, the house is painted in a painted protection against the red-brown wheel.
And the cinema room is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all of this is under close supervision by the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Frequently materials that are good and expensive were to be found, and that also enjoy the protection of monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a rough soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden, the "central station" is just the newly planned "quarter" with offices and apartments.
And another chance may happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the strengthening of another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg purchased the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, it already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a flat winter crisis in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
That costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the company of the railways "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million additional in this regard this year.
The "Bild"-Zeitung daily reported in advance, calling for an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments of around €300 million would be planned until 2015.
This should also allow for better availability of vehicles and the railway network in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the derailment of railway facilities, which should, inter alia, double and extend to 16,000 persons.
The objective is to clear snow and ice at the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the road equipment required for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Rüdiger Grube station chief warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company has had enormous problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reservations in the event of difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing what for years, since it has to check the axles of the ICE trains much more often at the workshop after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the central station of Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the United States.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is again in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this giant sector also hits the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million in comparison to $106 million to settle a dispute due to the failure of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage documents.
The regulator of the NCUA financial markets brings a number of charges to large banks, encouraging cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost enormous value during the financial crisis and have led banks to the bottom.
"We are pleased that we have been able to find a solution on this issue, without the parties having a trial in the court," said a spokesperson from Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank has not made any mistakes in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which committed itself to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage caused by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took part in other major banks, and in summer he was assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the issue of mortgage documents, it is "mortgage-backed securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events already date for a few years, it is currently blowing a storm wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought many remedies for redress or for sanctioning deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks of two U.S. state real estate funds Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of benefiting in kind from mortgages of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint with FHFA, which is several operations of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurt respond to "substantial losses", but without mentioning a specific amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the requests as being unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffet increase of 10 billion in IBM
Buffet, the financier, invests enormous amounts in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares for a value of more than ten billion dollars.
So far, American major investor Warren Buffett has explained that IT is not investing continuously in IT IT companies, since long-term company developments only show bad forecasts.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his view on investment in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier than IBM is proposing, above all, services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered to be an attack on the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT activity is granted the right to now call itself "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett has today revealed to the CNBC's economic issue, which he has bought since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew about this commitment until now.
He congratulated the management, who, even during the economic crisis, had provided reasonable benefits.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time placed IT profit services as "the operation of accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, over 100 years of age, offers both software and consultation as well as highly efficient business computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says that he invests only in the companies he understands.
But instead, Buffett is attacking the railway frenzy, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Her holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a whole series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old octogen had taken over in the 1960s" the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had raised it in the rank of one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
Following the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM shares increased by one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as is also called IBM, has a total exchange value of over $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of Zwickauer's "cell", Turkish media suspected the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population respond with fear and concern.
Because for many German-Turkish people, the spectrum that was believed to be dead for a long time reappeared: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no longer any violence comparable to this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
The fact that there is a xenophobia in Germany has never been a question.
However, the extremist right-wing network that has been detected reveals the proportions of which are far from predictable.
"Is it a return to bloody ideology," "This was the title of the Turkish daily Haberturk's Internet show.
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme right-wing scourge.
It is reasonable that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg gate.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish politicians had thought of a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It is with gay colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have an effect on a gifle: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also, the German "Hürriyet" layout does not simply remove unique conditions.
"It begins to grow," Tel is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He stressed that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The action of the police was very critical of the German-Turkish forums and they subsequently discussed the success of their research.
The authors are amazed at why the German authorities have not come much earlier to do research in certain highly-right suspect environments.
More than one turns out to be ready for at least rhetorical or drastic means: "If the case continues to be fought, there will be nothing left to migrants except self-defense and arms."
"it'll be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What this means is that if domestic peace in Germany is at risk, the attacks by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after Solingen's fire is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what mistrust and distance from acts of violence could lead to.
However, the attacks have sharpened our feelings in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past errors
At other times it was mainly the failure of the German policy after the attacks which the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After Solingen's fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the head of the Turkish State, represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time counted in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many Germano-Turkishs has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous Bank of Europe is located not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost failed in the financial crisis and suffered from one crisis to the other.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After its spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, in July, it was known that it would occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, he said hello; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently gained strength and made some kind comments on future colleagues.
"The UBS has made it to Turnround."
"I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Viliger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, from September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had turned all the Bank's security systems upside down and burned about EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grubel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
of the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS is considered to be suffering - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as reported by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economy and president of the bank, and he would certainly need an adaptation period.
Once again, he assumes responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the biggest bank to Europe's scandal".
In fact, the UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it has suffered for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing seems to save that proud Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also Russian, had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a very large bank in the area of banking investment.
Thus, UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from an easy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That's what impressed you.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich reported: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, we are wondering: how could I have simply been mistaken at this point?"
He's been deeply deceived.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time anything was not around the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli retreated in a surprising way, which had so far been regarded as a high intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later, we were told why he was leaving.
The division of the bank had flashed with sub-prime documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, the UBS announced an increase in capital of 13 billion francs and a crossover.
For this, it has actually found investors, but who would soon have faced the thorns: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silenced, to the extent that its name has never been learned.
This was, however, only the first time.
In April 2008 this became worse.
The bank was to announce again billions of losses, the president of the Marcel Ospel Board of Directors, which was still Switzerland's second best paid board in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and has to be saved by the State.
The National Bank has purchased from the UBS tens of billions of problem securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible bonds in shares, for which it could become co-owner of the Bank.
All Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to shelter from such large banks.
Finally, the total of the 2007 UBS was more than five times Switzerland's economic performance (see chart).
"We couldn't save UBS again," said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, he followed the second.
A few months earlier, the UBS had capitalized on a tax dispute with America and was ready to publish the data of the easy clientele, who had probably cheated on the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these operations with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS published more or less that it had helped tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that was always her capital in competition with rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the withdrawal of the Chief of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus the bank had lost credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud.
And, as there was a bit of a return to calm, and as we thought, the UBS would get out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of headline merchants: one brand-name dealer only worth EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank saw that something was not going around.
And it is published: with the management of investment bank risks, it still doesn't seem to work.
"With the Adololi case, it was found that the control of risks has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financier at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The UBS problem is that it does not control risks by hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their role, that of becoming guardian of the world's great fortune: not too much risk, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unbreakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still going to be paired with the strong click of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at the Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to the Zurich Lake, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the rentals of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's is found here among the Swiss tradition stores as well as those of the Confectionery Sprüngli.
For centuries Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank through the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another away from the market - or betrayed the two large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with both large banks.
The UBS would have become too large, it finds - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would also be widespread.
The Swiss would no longer have anything to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the walls of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then debunked: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the small country's government coalition to the seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, political men have agreed to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
When talking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined a large group.
A bank has been created, which was already too large for the small Swiss - and has continuously recorded an increase.
What helped was that the two banks different from UBS had completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with a strong point of asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already more internationally.
All of a sudden, international investment banks have had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who broke a path to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted himself until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group has always spoken the same word: to overthrow Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to climb everything up.
Some steps have already been made.
In the case of currencies and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
Business advisers, who were responsible for this, however, stressed a weakness: in international transactions of interest, in the fixed income bank jargon, there would be a huge difference between the largest banks.
The UBS would have shortcomings at the level of US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS was in an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Assets of growth are also the bank itself and a management fund created before it in U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed valuable documents based on American mortgage loans - but which also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been searching for a long time ago.
"In the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The more euphoria is great the more the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
UBS positions have become ejectable and so far banks.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank for which all the proposed business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't (yet) want to go so far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, so far it is clear.
Next Thursday, bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Switzerland was only supposed to be transitionally when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grubel.
Meanwhile, it was imposed: it must carry out the affairs of the UBS permanently, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Hermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money with?
These are the questions that "Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He said publicly until now only that he was going to look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.

American investors expressed themselves skeptically: "We are not an island, however dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, and there will also be other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
As a result, it was too early in its view to invest in obligations arising from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett cast an old principle of several decades into the wind and entered the U.S. technology industry

Smart corners spread in cities
In many places, frogs are considered to be "bird problem"° But experts claim that these very intelligent animals have not been allowed to hunt cities for long.
Some love them, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible. The corneas have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplied because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on the corneas, experts said it is no longer possible to hunt the city’s furrows.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities
The nature defenders also based the problems of cities on the exodus of particularly protected strawberries: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, building and felling typical cove trees made life difficult for birds.
The corners are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 coves in the Westfälische Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative advertising because of the corneal massacre in the region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killings with particularly brutal gardening.
"The normal eviction, the conquest, is useless," said the city planner and the Leer landscape, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nests by water under pressure or the reduction of trees, often with undesirable consequences, has been said by environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the large colonies divide and spread elsewhere."
The event is only in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without including the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animal survival to an aversive conditioning and adhesion offers, so that they can be relocated elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens looked forward to "info panels at the place of tronconiuses" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a face button with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-walking-educated corbels at Schleswig-Holstein, road panels that inform about the lives of these very intelligent brakes.
This project was adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "Here are a great number of communications, these birds have much to say."
The intelligence and ability of animals are legendary: Freight not only use work tools to reach a rule but they themselves manufacture their tools as work tools.
Ethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four tails, to what extent the intelligence of birds reaches.
In an experience, the birds quickly learned that they had to make an embodiment with stones to reach a larvae.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to make the platform collapse.
In a second test, the artificial horns then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, researchers had placed a small seal with a larvae.
The birds couldn't reach their nest with their bee.
However, researchers had made pieces of iron wire available to them.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they fished the small seal of the small tube.
Three of the four brakes are made right from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo takes Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosniaks and the Turks suddenly failed.
Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.

Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.

Sena Lulic was confronted by a red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a 30-metre free hit in front of the mail.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her remote shooting qualities and fired at a distance of 25 meters to do 2:0.

Jiracek set a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, Arbitrary Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during Bosnia's criminality, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portugal (36th).
On the other hand, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably divorted.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion has succeeded four times and everything has become clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also completed the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European Championship will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (FC Nuremberg), also had a chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Petr Cech's target garden has prevented a last minute's goal with a reflection by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when Duo Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to the Chech shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the aid of the world-class guard of the Czechs had already been beaten again, the attacker of the FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal was finally clarified shortly before the end.
Turkey was waving Zagreb's football miracle during this time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to leave his place on the 2002 EM third bank, the Croatians were able to enjoy their fourth round at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maximir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long shot with only the stake, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the target.
After the time of fear, Croatia has gained control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats left nothing to burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62th minute, the legionaries of the Bundesliga Danijel Prnjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.

Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) has equalized for visitors.
Ireland moved at a higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first chance.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence was able to prevent a possible goal of the first Butterfly.
In the 32nd minute, it's over.
After a fruitless defense of the target guard Pavel Londonk, Ward was handcuffed and closed the balloon on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, said the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and employ employees accordingly," PDG Bill McDermott announced to its clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The staff will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader of business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
To date, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4000 of the 176,000 SAP global customers are located in this country.
The growth plans in China are also an important element of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.

"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Personal mass reduction
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" begins with a long list of characters that closes your heart.
A tip to start: carefully identify this page and make it your brand page.
In this Roman story by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a milestone in these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and disappointed in the noises of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who delivers the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here a book outside the municipality which he accurately describes as "an anti-history book."
There are some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that "a book describing what it might look like." There are the "senses, impressions, experiences and humours."
"Beautifulness and Grief" summarizes the experiences during wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, passing through doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some of us will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war, some of whom will lose members, become mad or lose their lives.
Their lives stand here like the bars of a church: while some spread out, new ones appear.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
It deduces the idea that the First World War is just a summary of the terrible war of the Western front.
"Beautifulness and Grief" is well described in other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the rocks; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; Tsé-tsé flies are an intraitable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, such as a Hurricane Katrina that can take the cordite.
When canon blows keep away, and you're a mother at home, are you staying or running away?
Who'll come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been stifled by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high-sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most approach privatization and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund wrote: "Ersatz, everywhere is a substitute."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wood buttons."
He continued on the replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "meat made of rice broken into the fat of sheep (and ends with a false bone of wood); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potatoes skin; seeds of wooden shoes."
He states that "837 authorized meat substitutes are registered in the production of sauces. 511 substitute coffees are also found."
Some stories approach honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own pulsation towards the savagery and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, it is what men were destined to, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey by hand, reading a newspaper or a bet-seller, and instead of pretending that such a paint is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your tight and tight shirt.
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is at great risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When we are given up to sacrifice, we hope to have a public" he writes.
Unfortunately, it's rather comparable to "a man convicted in secret."
Other comments concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the cattle of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade due to gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and "stand on the genital organs in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness in life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way in which the war "started exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion for religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are fighting them.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel's Great War and Modern Memory, or "To the West Nothing Again", by Erich Maria Remarke, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most comprehensive that I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it was as if he had come up from his book, seized your hands on this page, where the list of people and burned with a lamp.
After a first false step, a minutely planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing helmets.
Monday night to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret to all but a few high-ranking officers and others informed from the beginning that they would conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges to the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, which went against the department's regulations and caused a storm of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Policemen were preparing to observe occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against Emotions - anti-terrorist measures that consist of moving a large number of police officers quickly - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the East River side of Manhattan.
The orders given to move into the park were "at the last minute", said an ordinary, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know who were called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person under the anonymity.
"The only ones who know they'd go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the police department."
The city has learned a lesson from the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, policemen wanted to clean up the park, but they were driven back by hundreds of demonstrators who were informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the area - dozens of officers used to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, as migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had fewer people" he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervention.
The recorded lights and messages from speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While Community business officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue windshield, many demonstrators simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tent was affected before 1:45 p.m., the police said, leaving time for the occupants to gather their cases.
Other police teams have been identified on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists within the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the Chief of Police Department, stated that this measure had been taken only in safety.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was strictly held by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that television cameras on Church Street, along the western side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police were moving westward through the dusty areas of the protesters' business, including baggage, plastic lawn and sheet bags filled with clothes, teams of the Department of Sanitation followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp have joined together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 p.m., Mr. Kelly said.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation was completed about an hour and a half later.
According to Mr. Browne, almost 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "disturbing public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most qualified officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operations", said Mr. Browne.
A second group of policemen were patient on the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a cottage in the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south.
The police were seen expanding the perimeter well beyond the Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, would have even been seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid events of the night took place in the south of the park.
About 5:00 p.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the hood of a police car. Others were seen burning the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a stopover came up by flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The School Aid Union is continuing the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of schools that have lost their jobs last month, plans to try a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schools.
The prosecutions are probably the union's last weapon, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school assistance, coordinators of parents and other employees, who were among the least well-paid in the city, lost their jobs last October 7th. Trade union leaders compared these dismissals to a political revenge for not having allowed the city to access a health fund run by the working groups, which would have allowed the budget gap to be closed last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this charge.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the discharges were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied, stating that school grants were not specified in the budget at all.
The officers of the 37th District Council stated that they would complete a complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions to the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defending party. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of black or Latin American origins, such as most of the school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the City's Legal Department, said that the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and could therefore not comment on the allegations.
According to a statement of complaints received by the New York Times, the union would place on the number of dismissals in the city's most disadvantaged schools to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular sub-financing.
While there is no license on Staten Island, and a few hardly in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school grants have lost their jobs in Brownsville's 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five schools out of eight employees at the 36th public school in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecutions say that "it is not a quarter of easy parents who can raise funds to fill the budget deficit."
The budget of the 36th Public School was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funding was also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each underprivileged student registration.
The union also claims that the school directors could have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the licensing of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "overtime" to describe the action, although "overtime" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaint, "sixty-six parents' coordinators have been licensed", and "not just because of overcoming".
Mission accomplished: Congress finds agreement on the issue of Libya
Finally, it would seem that the Republicans and Democrats had reached agreement in the Chapter on the issue of uprising in Libya.
A successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-term dictator Muammar Kadhafi, as well as the U.S. involvement, will have taken place.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), praising the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from the two parties, together with the White House, came into conflict on the formulation of several resolutions to approve the military role of the United States in NATO's mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to authorize limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day as the bill failed, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The US mission has therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress is sufficiently opposed to criticizing Obama's mission management, but not enough to cut grass under its feet.
The indecision of Congress was exceeded by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed last 20 October.
NATO's mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "blesss the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "blesss the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate or will it divide the legislators as last June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution in order to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Vierginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a vote to sit in the House or the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to the Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slightly different from a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handhold that would "control federal expenditures".
Some of these bills are identical, but give support to them - especially the new Republicans who want to earn their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates for which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democratic - New York) wishes to remove the two mandates for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic - Illinois) proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment banning marriage between individuals of the same sex is always proposed, as is the amendment banning the profanity of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the repeal of federal laws if the two thirds of States oppose them.
They are also not as fast as they have been in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The slowdown compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - on 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacree but not beaten" said Gabrielle Giffords during his first interview on television since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at the end of Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic - Arizona) appeared on Monday night on a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted to get back to Congress first.
When he appeared on the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show approached its difficult return following the ball that broke its skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first interview on television since the shooting in January, who killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "hard".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, replied "better."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast the watch of the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special issue has traced the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting on January 8.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a wide scar on the front.
She can only use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair while doctors teach him to perform simple actions.
A sign from the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords sucked another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: are you seeing the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanda Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with doctors, said not to remember the shooting.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the March 12 shooting when she stopped and asked for information for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and is actively treated while awaiting trial.
"There's been a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
At her restoration, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're gonna get out of it, you're gonna get back and you're gonna be even stronger than ever.
More mercy than respect for the troops
The event: a Wall Street gala to collect millions of dollars for vets without a home in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in costume-crawl stood at its feet to cheer him up.
"Militaries, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of spring fundraising.
A high-level military presence in the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of the U.S. Army, has seen the role of the troops differently.
"They were presented as some sort of orchid," wrote the military high-grade in an electronic mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they say a few soldiers.
The public acts more and more as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not all the victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to get us into the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear unrecognizable or in disagreement with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the coming troops of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversation about mercy takes place in all privacy among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were faced with insurgents and traveled to distant contrasts.
Others would wonder whether "an angry and violent veteran was hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had returned to work with the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said he felt that some people who made him pass the interviews were subtly asking if he would be able to keep up with the stress of a job requiring Washington immediately after his return to the fight.
"When you approach the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to war.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a country so little familiar with the army and which sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II," says Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of the political men and the people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
The troops are recognized for the number of periods of prolonged service, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The Army Faces the Growing Pressure to Oppress Violents
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged rape inaction.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
The 1st class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant 11 weeks the night she claimed she was raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008. She would come to her house at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room to drink a glass.
"It was an alarm signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texas has put her anxiety aside.
I thought: no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, thrown on the ground and raped, claiming her.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will look forward to the decision of justice during a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether a trial against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape in the army, thus opposing the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Arranged in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 months - 25 women and 3 men, all alleged to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's taking care of the galloned soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"What are the individuals in position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of bringing all the complainants together in this case - putting all his eggs in the same basket - it will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The Defence Team, for the Department of Defence, led by American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, called the Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents indicate.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not have the official right to go to war, this distinction is recorded only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers' teams play an increasingly important role, including contact with local women.
As a result, 150 women soldiers lost their lives in two thirds of the war.
It's time for the army to modernise to declare Susan Burke.
She is not alone in carrying out this fight: three other trials are underway.
At Yale's Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Centre prepares a case against the four main military academies to encourage a misogynous environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnostics of " personality disorders " attributed to victims of rape to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a group for human rights.
His group attempted a trial in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in handling requests for benefits for those who reported having been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan combination of senators and representatives, proposing a number of solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The March report also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were prosecuted - half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the military police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to report her rape to several police officers, doctors and commanders 11 times in detail.
She went up a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge, in a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relationship with her little friend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator of the crime, who ended up being executed.
"I remember the day the verdict was made," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contracts.
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commander, "It wasn't his trial, it was mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosed with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was referred under less honorable terms, preventing any benefit.
Whether the Lyman case and other complainants will move forward or not, it is a long story, says John Turley, professor of law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized Dr. Feres.
The army is located decades later because it does not have the same benefits and means of deterring it.
"The chances are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things only change when the good are willing to fight.
If the trial does not turn out for them, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, one or both of the two options.
Walls have eyes: Researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple man who shared his online anti-immigration views.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken from murder in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of his time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so hard to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report published by the DEMOS reflection group on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook reports so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the website's advertising tool to find people they are looking for with scientific precision - the way marketers have done it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of extreme right groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, ads invited users to respond to an inquiry. The questions raised concerned their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people via Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 players from 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries without leaving the office.
"It's a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of the right groups are, rather, men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The DEMOS study is just an example of how Facebook has become the new uncompromising tool between scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and politicians use the site to study all topics that concern health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I'love", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, the "supernova data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research work the site's name appears to be almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach in the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they would never have let you in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploitations were far more likely to be alcoholic than the discreet students in this regard.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counsellors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would be too often talk about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," says Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Research Institute for Children located in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, which would not be otherwise recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses information from its users.
The site's data team has studied statistics on the loving situation and the day of Valentine's Day, the rate of participation in the mid-term 2010 elections and a national happiness index (only information available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play at Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, there is nothing else online.
"I don't think a large number of users have already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without access to the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the level of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you actually do are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools to use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are meant to look at the social aspect - and the social aspect, it's not in front of a computer."
"Froid and Inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars," he explains in front of a hearing room full of 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it, because you hold your mandate of organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't complain guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this process to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought him a speech on paper, to speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, prohibited him from talking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would monitor almost all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 surviving parents and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya at the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I made some personal progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
With a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes as they entered and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a large "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of an entire group of radicals, which may be comforting to some.
But this does not reduce the sorrow or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I'd rather he looked like a monster, but that's not the case," said a victim's parent.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, film this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared it to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computer science.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in Steve Jobs' interview recently found and will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is the extent to which this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease allowing them to think that a great idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traced the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringelly's maintenance is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It's only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly restored, is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast on Wednesday and Thursday next.
For someone known to hate deep interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exhibiting technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And incredibly careful.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly stresses his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs rises up, where it seems to be impatient to hear the questions of Cringley, giving him caution to speed him up and move him to more important issues or subjects.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, a strangely scrupulous aspect is found on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computer science.
It's one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something crude and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dream of watching the size.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He then explains the implementations.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a company:
"During all these years, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?" and the answers are always the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them."
No one knows why, no one deeply reflects on things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details of his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Perplexing how costs were recorded - often started with a "standard cost" evaluated for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs reports the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack phone networks and call for free in long distance.
The device was the subject of many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of ownership is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, passing a call and connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped up the ball of things a half a dozen times and yelled at the public phone, and it came a minute later on to the public phone on the other side," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something that could control billions of infrastructure worldwide."
We didn't know a big thing, both of us, but we were able to invent a small thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful turn that he and Wozniak have developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night, passing through for Henry Kissinger and asked to talk to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go mad laughing just before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett's departure):
At the age of 12, he is looking for Bill Hewlett's number in the yearbook for the spare parts to manufacture a frequency.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs subsequently became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first office computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathodic tube, and I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs is talking about inventing new products at a head start.
At the beginning of his career, while he is installed to sell some printed circuit cards, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working for only 30 days of credit, he must take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later, in Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember great disputes... I was raised above by claiming that it would take me five years [to manufacture a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Forty-nine days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15, which would have been incredibly reliable.
Of the large companies which are engaged:
Even before he brought Apple back to life, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would cheat and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you work at IBM or Xerox, make a better copy or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company no longer succeeds.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are the types of people] that end up leading companies and the specialized staff in the product are put away from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely corrupted by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have held the entire computer industry.
She could have done her current size ten times. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They've made the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"An enormous part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, the electrons can do it, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) in the same way as each other.
Finally, the decisions are made by personal taste. This is about trying to expose you to the best products created by men, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists fly.
We're always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply found the best computer scientists in the world.
If it was not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with opponents of the right to health while the court meets
The day the Supreme Court met in private to examine the issue of political disagreement, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's health law would be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were observed during a dinner sponsored by the attorney's office who will defend the case before the High Court.
The event took place on Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss requests for consideration.
One of the cases in question was a trial by 26 States that challenged the reform of the ambitious health care voted by Congress last year, a law that was a point of departure for conservative militants at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, and a monumental argument of 530 is expected in March next, and the result will likely be of a nature to support the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision will be delivered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as US general candidate during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen cabinets that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-term group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who presented a huge financial issue as a result of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There were, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Senate's republican top and a declared opponent of the Health Act.
The guests see you at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct governing the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would undoubtedly argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend collections of funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be an intervener, a guest of honor, or on the program of such an event."
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the business lawyers' offices, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, is enough to alert government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and great indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court complies with the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and eating and collecting gala funds with lawyers who had cases before the court."
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds for this event demonstrate any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little concern for critics claiming to mix court affairs too easily with group agendas such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high profile conservative.
In addition, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a problem of ethics, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an applicant general to the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the level of the Court of First Instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had invested too much in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for airline aircraft
The air carrier Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-colored aircraft, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order covering 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is a case when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record of $18 billion.
All of this is also incredible from whom Boeing received this command: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the company in Chicago estimates that the air carriers in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft command in his history - 50 Boeing 777 bicolors.
It is the air company Emirates based in Dubai that passed this Pharaohic command.
Boeing announced to the Dubai Air Force in 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that the company Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model that boasts important fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to over $1 billion.
"It is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have an enormous value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in the fuel price - which is harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the increase in the oil price.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the oil price increases, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk coverage," he said.
The Command of Emirates reinforces Boeing's predominance on the wholesaler aircraft market and helps to block the attempt to implode the airbus competitor with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aeronautics salon comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to report the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus postpones its beginnings to increase its push following the demand of its customers to increase its capacity for cargo and its autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president manifestly beat at the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped her rival Fausto Vallejo of the Pri in the race to the governor's office.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to gain access to the post of Governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favoured one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was in charge of the race at the position of governor of that western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming event, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said on the radio during an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officers... they ran out of urns, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for sixty-ten years until the loss of its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only recently been identified by Calderon, who was in charge of polls before the day of the elections.
Calderon, a candidate for the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate from the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, has become a third, a painful failure before the 2012 presidents for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the State, has disbanded all ties with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafficking.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally in fear.
However, for PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections seem, a victory will help the party in its wake.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
The BASD strongly encourages Asia to come to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growth in the world had to "do everything in their power" to speed up the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral agreements.
He advised BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe with a "indifferent eye" and noted that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would "avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy".
"We're all in this crisis together."
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point but it is not sheltered."
"So if China and India can help, nothing can stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously crushed by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously high and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has fuelled the fear that the world economy will not come down, and has called for the major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would extend any Asian aid, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the United States' financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater power for negotiations with the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and Industry of India, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a decline in the arrival of foreign capital.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans while facing their own important economic challenges.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, stated that it would be politically very difficult to accept assistance to Europe at 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live with $2 a day, or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks will retire at 50 years of age and that they will go on vacation in the sun and will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis could cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
The BASD forecasts of economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "risk of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed "to develop "supply plans" to protect themselves from economic returns and significant capital leaks.
Some Pentagon warnings on potential defence reductions
The Secretary for Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget compressions would know national security, and he launched a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon has already cut $450 billion for the next decade, but is now afraid that an additional $600 or more compression will be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting from what is called kidnapping would result in 23% reductions as well as the freeze of many new projects.
"A reduction so important, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and our construction projects impeccable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
Reductions would possibly affect combat troops, Panetta continues.
"Although the financing of contingent accounts abroad during wartime is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts that support war."
"The staff managing salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, requesting details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as the world leader of the undisputed military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter from Panetta.
"It's not a consequence that we can live with, and it's certainly not what we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not happen."
That the letter from Panetta and the senators' recent warnings increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or an appeal to exempt the Pentagon from reductions remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though it has reached the highest level of the Pentagon's accumulated years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that it was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a soldier with a shell, but not a nude.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's a hunting plane, not enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed, ill-prepared and unable to deal with potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites the attack."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "produce significant operational risks: time for response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in future combat operations".
And Panetta stated that some of the biggest defence projects could be cut off, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the new ballistic submarine of a new generation, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivers.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the recent masks indicates the extent to which deception and lying are prevalent in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for the presidency, Herman Cain, is engaged in the exchange of allegations of sexual harassment with several women, each accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been accused of paring for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach has sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open-ended microphone claiming US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York Congress member and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, has been turned into an idiot by quickly issuing disunity contrary to irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violating the funding of campaigns related to the coverage of an extramarital relationship.
And then, none of those who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton started by lying during his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of trickery at school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave the students their test answers in order to show themselves well on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are wicked lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
To detect or detect lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I've had you," the detection of fraud is a serious knowledge branch based on scientific data collected over the last six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted deep research on such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about the lie have been demystified.
The liars look into your eyes.
They don't fight, they don't fight, they don't fight, they don't fight, they don't fight.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the time of response.
I spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about fraud, and it is clear that the detection of fraud is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or management.
Good mentors are able to read to others, by putting them at ease, by managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centered on them" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty to lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "set the benchmarks."
This helps to provide a benchmark to measure subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally removes his feet permanently so that you do not make unfair accusations when you see him remove his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for indexes of verbal and nonverbal misleading behaviors.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of fraud.
Swindlers can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, think towards a exit, change their posture significantly, or present a relief of "post-interview" - an excessive breath of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Questionnaires often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview response.
So be careful with your subject's vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson stepped down using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a national search to find her.
Swindlers can also use a remote language: "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a completely difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember things... to my knowledge."
This makes the conceptual response rather than actual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize fraud is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by predators in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial oil pipeline plan will be routed after the late United States approval threat
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - triggering the anger of trade unions while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oil pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to put it on the rails.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline outside the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, claims that the company remains confident that it will end up obtaining the approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala Gulf, from large groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have rejected any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed its support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.
To do so, he would have to cross six States.
It was attended by environmentalists, but liked by working groups, who placed over 20,000 estimated oil pipeline-related jobs.
But Nebraska legislators who oppose this plan pressure that a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills and Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the department's inspector-general ordered a separate survey of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would be a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice from its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, launched in a riot of violence in their building hall in Manhattan, terrorized their little girl to the point where she threw it away.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's triad ravaged the 18-month-old little Genevieve Monk to the point where she suffered "from personality changes, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of foreigners," said her family during the proceedings of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10th of last year while the screen technician Kevin Monk, his wife as a teacher of children's garden, Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing for family travel.
While Kevin Monk was looking for the car, Rosana Monk went down to the hall of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevieve in his arms.
Rosana Monk said she had stopped at the door and had laid her daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman of anger.
"She told me about an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter at the door," said Rosaanna Monk.
"I said to him, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to use swearing - the word "" and the word "" of a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me from the water of the bottle.
She said that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself onto her mother - who always held Genevieve in her arms - and had to be held by her surrounding who had trained her to a car waiting for them, says Rosana Monk.
The little girl would cry so hard that she's gone to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but did not get any answers.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and the family plans to make a donation of all the money received to charity against cancer for children.
"The aim is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a maternal teacher with an 18-month-old."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first management year of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-appointed for change, which has generated great expectations regarding economic progress, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from the loss of billions for the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the State economy for growth, led to a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report on freezing by the Mexican Sustainable Rural Development Council, there were damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main affected crops were vegetables, maize and chic fish.
The decline in economic activity has generated, up to November, a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three quarters of the year has been accelerated, as while from January to March 55 thousand 053 were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate of more than 74 thousand are unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the AUS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly in line with the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of the resources approved by Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy that they work for them, that they invest them and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the State to work abroad has been restricted to the United States, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they already have many difficulties in finding work, these people stay here and ask for work sources, which makes unemployment rising," he said.
Deficit
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is compounded by considering the high level of serious lack that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state work without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
In addition to unemployment and serious lack of employment, another reason for the disbursement for the state is low wages, the entity has lower salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
By September, the average monthly income of workers was 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED contract
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011, the highest reduction in foreign direct investment over the last 10 years was recorded, according to the State's Economics Secretariat from January to June GDP reached $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143,312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, mainly recorded by companies in the third sector.
Leave This
Given the economic contract scenario, the Government of the State requested in July the approval of a 3 billion-weight credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with a view to revitalizing the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600-billion-weight and until November no profit was observed from debt in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the patron sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés showed a lack of Government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State, in 2011.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, it is necessary to work hard to recover the land that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and above all the good already synchronized walk of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economist
Loredo López stated that events such as early-year freezes have taken hold of the state's economy and have restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including ice, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows it to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year, we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Mexican Confederation of Sinaloa, stated that the state is to be channelled towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms, we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important to detonate all the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channelled the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas, with regard to economic development progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still much to do," he said.
Condemned for 8 kilos of marijuana
A person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Parquet of the Republic reported that the convicted minor trafficker was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a health crime, in his variant of possession of marijuana for sale.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker circled in a pick-up truck, white, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's trunk and on the spot of the copilot a small bag behind where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still at the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Consequences of Offences.
Debts towards contributions to books
The social literature included in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished where serious delays due to lack of economic resources are reported by Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that even though construction programs have so far progressed, they are in a risk situation because the Government has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pounds in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State had to provide 25 per cent and only the Federation and the Municipality had so far provided resources for the works, and therefore there was the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They must make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even though since July they had to give us a share of it," he said, "and we, in order not to be late, started the works and we made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the 7 million that the administration of the State had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to operate and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to obtain resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Although there is a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had made a request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management to ensure that the corresponding percentages reach as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given us nothing."
The valid Court of Analogue Cutting in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals by digitals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has raised the constitutional disputes raised by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which runs from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes required for disabled persons were not gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his duties when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was raised for failure to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and statutory reservation.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree and, by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the implementation of the decree and all the actions provided for by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also resolved to address the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project to which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in that the Federal Executive could not structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I do not consider it any more than if it were to affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has for constitutional mandate the government's management.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has ever experienced in recent years and this has resulted in better operation of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more chains.
Admitting the change, he said, would be adjourning the benefits of digitisation, which involves a decision of public interest that does not only have a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
He stressed that "the operation of an entire system requires, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, a group of tasks which the Constitution grants to the State Executive's faculty."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition and had done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has infringed the sphere of competence of Congress in some way, as it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative.
An analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" discount in Michoacán
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total records.
The option of the "voting by vote" discount is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total records.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of State or his Electoral Justice Act, while at the same time the Congress of State approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process to enter into force, and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel has omitted its publication within the time limits provided for by the Official Journal of the State Act, arguing that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and described the vote of the State Secretary for Constitutional Reform as "inappropriate and illegal" because he did not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated that with the approval of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of EMI, it would be possible to make partial and total savings of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial downturn of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and there is no record of voting in the urn file at the chairman of the hearing; or there are obvious errors or changes in the records.
In addition, the total deduction of the votes received in all polls can be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate in the respective election and the candidate in the second ballot is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the representative of the party and/or coalition who has submitted the second of the candidates reported.
The total savings of the ballot may also be made if at the end of the common disbursement it follows that the difference between the proposed candidate winning and that of second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party to which the candidate is seconded, in which case the electoral packages which have been the subject of the partial disbursement will be excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of Morelia's election, where according to the PRESS, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting for the votes of 129 of the 923 total verbatim records.
His Last Will
His ashes will be spread in the Serra of Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a rest.
According to his family, the last will of the Lieutenant Colonel was to spread his ashes in the Zapalinam Serra.
After receiving the honors of the other people dying in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft from the Mexican Air Force, the nearest attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the watchroom of the Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where the family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was honoured at the Institute of Technology of Saltillo, organized by his former colleagues of tech baccalaureate and the American football team of Felipe Bacio when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He would like to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes spread into Zapalinamé's serum, he always said that's what his family and friends said," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the Lieutenant-Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she considered that he was in the fullness of his life, "he had success, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared for his family very much."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the College of Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he had a bad truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old, he traveled to Zapopán for his father's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
I'll see you later.
It was said with honour to welcome Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, to the honour of Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of the service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 6:05 p.m. to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the plan of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three bodies abandoned, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before it was found, the military authority had brought 11 persons to the media who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes involving organized crime.
Three men were found killed at shots of fire shot in different parts of the body and with the blow of grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery took place at the 1.5 km road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed through this place noticed that in the property, whose close has the beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, at about three meters, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another one with a white T-shirt, with bracelets.
At one metre away there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue-colored jeans.
The three were stretched on the belly.
According to the in situ data, the three persons were killed in another location, as no malformations were found in situ.
In the closing of the property there were legends addressed by an organized crime group towards each other, except for a few dance orifices in the one and the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group primarily operating in the municipality of Cadereyta and who were considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (monitoring) and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested in the Los Alveros colony in the first place on 11 November and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
Three buildings and a cell phone were confiscated; they claimed to be part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event, which took place on 12 November at 06:00, military personnel took a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 to 14:00, one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed to clandestine inhumations in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on board the economic disaster and put the whole of the Eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present an office composed in its majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take up his position.
Monti said he would present to the president the result of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well drawn", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy was struggling with a political and financial crisis that raised the costs of its debt at impossible levels to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a strong austerity package required by European leaders to regain the trust in Italy that had been entrusted.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to accelerate, the instability of the markets to place the performance of the Italian BTP obligations at 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronage Confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly encouraged by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which forced the crisis to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Government of a majority technocrat than Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be popular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief repetition at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now come to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the general predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections proceed.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insisted that he should be trained only by specialists, an indication of his objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
Spanish experience is higher than that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called by Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 called attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 called by the two countries for today's friendly at 3:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide record of Class A inter-selective games, the Tricolore only has Michael Humana as the only defender to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain an intense year-long activity in national league and cut-off championships and European matches such as the Champions League.
To this end, the experience with Furia Espanola must be added during the complex eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international experience in an area such as Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the target guardian Íker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) compared the record of the former target guardian Andoni Zubizirreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against the Tricolor today and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain steering wheel, at 106.
Cassillas and Xavi were even recognized last week by UEFA next to the other hundreds of Iberian teams, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the former centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Centennial loan is available to Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Humana are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and Bryan Ruiz butter, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not yet begin.
The historical butter of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records it most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that this will also become a dream to happen in this country.
It is that the bassist and founder member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and Sunday 20 will take its only step in Central America.
This day will be presented at the National Stadium, beginning at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an extract from the conversation, whose full transcription is in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I only spent my vacations in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live intensively the previous days.
What is your message for your most keen fans?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry that so much time had to go by.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We offered two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really very impatient to produce it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned it, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that all about?
I think it's partly because we have nine CDs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each love different songs, so it's very difficult to choose which songs to interpret every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have not interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprise us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten them.
This makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you will celebrate 20 years of travel.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell of our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't go any better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the earth?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this large group.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's not common.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their tour, so we are lucky to be still friends with them all and it is an honor for us to be part of this sound from Seattle that emerged.
It is as strange that a group like yours remains united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and this is only much longer than many groups normally last.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect music and what it has brought, without taking into account the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and we didn't publish a record before Andrew Woods died.
There was a lot of frustration about the fact that it lasted so little and most importantly that we were still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas national group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer online and this must be very distracting.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's words online?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so many...
Among the first ones I remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge under control despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it is wonderful because it is a music that is worth listening to and the groups like Mudhoney are now doing the best music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the result of this change?
It is interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe described as very dark songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and those are deeply dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or a friend, these things start to affect your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent this to me.
I also think that we can be happy as well and even as we can do with dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fujimori would be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and the loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in her opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the release of the penalty for humanitarian reasons, he no doubt said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It was operated four times by tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as a severe erosive gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and foot traffic problems, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been recruiting since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people due to an army plan to destroy him and his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official court, headed by the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and patrons, will launch a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "favourable for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when French envoy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French town of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations of its ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
On a commercial basis, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 as a Free Trade Treaty (FTA), which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu lead passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, tireless, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil Bowser's grip, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he would fight for the love of young people in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to shops around the world, has been designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using flashlights.
"Mario is the character who must say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game designed for this support", because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations to existing titles.
Nintendo's password argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Alvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the least skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose real-time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "sympathize with optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion into the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes an eyebrow for saga fans and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustachu plumber must run through dangerously-mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even if I'm a player I find new things in the movements, environments, customs and enemies and also in Luigi's "playable" case.
Colom gives its way to the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for conspiracy to whitewash 70 million dollars.
Thus, the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge it ends.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of judicial and executive power, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office, "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had taught all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Morocco will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done is an executive step after he has exhausted all the judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former member of the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the diversion of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Ministry of Public appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The assessment of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this fourth century.
In addition, the long hundreds of jobs currently obtained by this social group are added.
The anniversary was used yesterday to balance in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinidad Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people who were poorly trained, without work, with problems of addiction or marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The variety of political representation, in full electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Along with the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Arthur Mas and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, attended the act by former Minister of Social Education Ernest Maragall and former Deputy Mayor to the mayor and current municipal councillor Richard Goma.
It is also attended in the large hall of Fabra i Coats, the current Minister of Social and Family Welfare, Josep Lluís Cleries and the general director of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The President gave Trinijove an example of how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by scouts for micro-feasts, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 apartments of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
It seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived on ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying at noon yesterday, and where they organized micro-festations that would be desperate for neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock of the door was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From this day on there will be a control of access," said the administrator.
The scatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving residues there of any kind, especially the boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and disappointed the tenants.
Alongside the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that her business had dropped by 80% since the building was occupied.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfaithful because they sold the glass to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the resort had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors about the noise, while, according to this, the nuisances were not caused by the discotheque customers, but by the residents of the occupied house, and especially the participants in the festivals organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the annoying neighbors of the area.
The director of the discotheque explained that the nuisances were so great that she even made an agreement with the owner of the building and that it was nine months ago that he "forgived" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the mayor's municipal PP group Alberto Fernández Díaz called last week for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of life in common and civil life that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that only one floor of the building was occupied before the summer, but in recent months the Scouts had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that there were also flights in some apartments.
In this sense, he added that "it must end with impunity and be implacable against the anti-social behaviour generated in property".
Yesterday, Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral, number 35, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the occasion of the call beyond the debate on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
About the middle of the 1980s, in full support of the already-extended Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration has printed Collserola promotion posters.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of the Metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park again became, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (mar).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with bloodthirsty in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competence consisting of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door returns to the idea of park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to his organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a conversation of all the architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme where two members of this former caste speak when they are recognized in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions that three Barcelona architects, university professors, have come up with.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the front of the mountain" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of the green houses pasta was not carried out at the end.
"It must come from the base that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the title of "Callserola doors" includes a "lexical trap": it should not be thought of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which action must be taken".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "a few dangers".
Hazards arising from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and that had been in the forum's "song of cygne".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its overstepping.
"New urban planning instruments need to be considered, because current [referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)] can cause real disasters."
In keeping with the question, Modol believes that by simplifying the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no."
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola's patronage that "must not be lost", thanks to the opportunity that the mayor offers his corporation to intervene in this project "from the outset".
In addition, he believes that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the extra-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "dispute" if this technical profile must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he says) that we must create: "We architects should only be an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because there is a lack of a global view of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-border competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that leads and understands the area as a whole."
This does, at least in this case, choose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to be shocked into the program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In her opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band is immediately higher than that of Ronda de Dalt, which should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardon to Jonas Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal basis of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of detention, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal authority of the Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, which follows a trial against the mayor's brother of Monterrey.
After the assassination of the Royal Casino, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic quota so that the Mayor of Monterrey would allow the hidden functioning of the game house.
After the public denunciation, the Parquet opened a criminal trial against the PANIST mayor's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and held in temporary custody for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Department of Public Offences Agent 3, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the Capital of the State.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was issued a second detention order after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had committed organized crimes of corruption and crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's criminal center, allegedly for having made the owners of the Red Casino sing with one and a half million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the middle security detention centre because there were threats of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as that relating to the fall of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the game house in exchange for his operation.
On Monday, the foundation of the legal authority of the Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, was presented by Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; he could therefore regain his freedom within the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Ministry agent attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under Case 197/2011, legal pardon was granted to Jonás Larrazábal and no claim concerning the proceedings sought against him could be filed; no damages and no punishment would be sought.
After hearing the foundation of the legal power of the game house, at 3:50 p.m., the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to communicate to Jonas that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also inform him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven others lost his life
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost his life indicated that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to the take-off of the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the poles had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the firing."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it met the requirements for the transport of staff.
In addition, he said that investigations carried out in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a study, it was reported that there were no aircraft parts or components elsewhere, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
For the time being, the Secretary has ensured that a priority is to have results as soon as possible; however, the investigation may take a few months, even a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, has ensured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State was operating at a speed of cruise, and this happened on an ascending ground.
"This information supports the assumption of a normal functioning to cross at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Full Visual:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out in accordance with the visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM referred to adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft moved to the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-height fog layers.
Selected paths:
It is likely that "due to the conditions of nebulism, the crew has sought a lower and more visible area to the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the coincident radar, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral route.
The dispersal model of the rest of the aircraft assumes that the helicopter crashed against the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No signs of fire or explosion were detected:
In the place of distress there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of an explosion or fire type.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, aircraft parts at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level were found, and the ground had a slope that ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarmed during his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a detailed search in a larger area than the area around the accident, there were no scattered parts of the aircraft, which is supposed to have taken place under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social insurance conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; this is supported by IDP specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol, which will enable the markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital des Specialités du Medical Centre Nationale de 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by experts and third-cycle students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Advanced Research and Studies Centre (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is called upon to participate in the right or wrong population, to present themselves to the participating sports units of IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence for minors takes place every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Sporting Unit Cuahutémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity took place in the Sporting Unit of Nezahualcoyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (south of Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (south of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this research and the purpose of this research was to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity and to identify among children and young Mexicans the risk factors to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be held on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to gather three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family heritage of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of the size), blood pressure, glucose determination, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (it is sought to identify people associated with child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this investigation is the result of health professionals' concern about the alarming weights taken in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in only six years there was a 77 per cent increase in obesity in boys and in girls of 47 per cent; there was also a dramatic increase in overweight,' said IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers was based on the fact that the population of the country was different from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of Indo-American heritage, 30 per cent European and 5 per cent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity translate into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows them to detect whether they are overweight or obese.
It even says that the presence of the darkest color (acanthosis) on the thigh and front arms indicates the likelihood of metabolic and even pre-diabetic changes.
The information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors send it in writing to parents, to whom each of the measures and changes in the life-style that they have to make to prevent diseases are explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of television and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates of carbon (tumbles - meat paste to corn flour wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the paving signals were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cases each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) researcher, who ensured that if the building and maintenance of the bituminous paving process is adequate, the cases could be reduced or even completely eliminated.
During his conference A technological opinion on the case, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and therefore case formation.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the peacock its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes breaking, it adds.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineer warns.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad in Mexico were mostly covered by a flexible floor, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most surface layers is the asphalt layer, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, it signals, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well in the floor.
If the asphalt had been modified, it would have spread better to the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, we put a last layer called the asphalt layer, made of fine stone, that is, of sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this layer is in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide access to the street.
As part of the floor that receives and distributes the effort, the rolling layer also requires that it has adequate thickness and the material it is made must be maintained.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature changes, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil wets, the water spreads within the layer it is difficult for the soil to form, which refills all layers of the floor and therefore causes cassis.
In the process of forming a case, he said, the first that is missing is the motion film and only later the asphalt layer is affected, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicle loading is another important factor for case formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the floor must always be linked to vehicle loading and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent case formation.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which exist in other countries already on the market and allow for the repair of cases easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What's wrong with Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her title number 14 from the princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of winners, wearing the crown of silver and the band that accredited her as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result of last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and sceptre, the department has already added 14 titles from Princess and Melina to a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but have been proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Ever (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the great question that many people ask is:
What was missing? Because the result is the failure of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected Queen of the Police and Best Vision Jolie de Vogue, the titles obtained by Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took over Miss Colombia's crown.
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the jury to appoint First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here's Valle's candidate's answer to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in literature, I think it's a form of culture, I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it's a universal literature book that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
This answer was not in the first place due to the term "culturalize" and, secondly, not to explain specifically how each book had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wisdom, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, please read, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the assumptions launched is the one according to which the Valley was destroyed by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist said that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prices (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and for this she did not shine on the scene".
And it was noted in his first performance in the bathroom mellot on Hilton beach and his two performances from the crown watch.
Although she was sure of herself at the two shows, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program "Como en casa" (As at home), of the Canal RCN said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "confirms that the candidate who receives most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen".
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the competition starts, they are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned by his faults of his back and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury has chosen him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which had actually not been too known to me, left her points the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine considers that the error of the Valle candidate was the surgical intervention she had undergone.
"The surgeons are good, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this."
For this prize, the National Contest of Beauty returned for the first time, after the dance in the bathrobe, a cruel prediction that took place last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by appointment of the National Competition.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who, despite her blasphemous passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
So was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Dactyloscope from Cali has passed on to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4 a Dactyloscope of the CIT of Cali passed on to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Seven Dactyloscopes working in the local ITC offices this week were the "availability" tour of Elias González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle, and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscope, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. sweats and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano alias, he had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the scene of the body, he did not recognize it by his physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He didn't have a beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more leaner.
But prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian wolf, an encre, a kidnapper and a lantern, Eliaszar compared the fingerprints of the body to those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible who confirmed to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the Supreme Chief of the Farc.
Looking for the print
For a doctyloscopist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Elias González, in a press conference for the operation against Cano, is very significant.
A lot of people didn't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from identifying corpses, dactyloscopicists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders have false identity cards or no documents.
We take their fingerprints and searches in the database.
The researcher reported that in a flight case he had to remove a part of the wall from a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to get out a chest full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we have been able to get the whole handprint and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
The fingerprints may also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently, we found a dead man with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent could be suspected of the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it's the one on the scene of the crime.
A ICT Dactyloscopicist explained that "digital fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" were extracted.
When they appear, a receiver or a band is used to pick them up.
Later, the prints are sent to Asif, the trigger database, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of paperless Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He explained that everything is not how to show in the CSI television program.
Since everything that shines is not gold, everything we touch does not necessarily become a print.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignity" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators marched in front of the Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large number of people have entered the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to re-enter, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, from which they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Great Pompey.
Hundreds of demonstrators marched in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access a court order that allowed the 'indignity' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we're going to settle in another place and we're going to continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the Movement "Occupe Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray details that the answer of the 'indignity' to the evacuation of their camp, personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited forced evacuation of the site and allowed protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the "indigested" occupied a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which is owned by the Trinity Church Paris.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, ensuring that he had seen some journalists to whom we had also passed the spells.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in the area, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of members of the movement and has tried to intervene in their behalf before the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti place - which is a private property facility - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled by this Tuesday during which the lawfulness of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Several demonstrators who had moved there were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at that time, and they even delivered it to the officers who were monitoring the scene, which caused 'some small confrontations', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials had hit the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupe Wall Street or from applying 'laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or from preventing protesters from re-accessing the park with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, but he warned them that local laws would not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor has personally defended the evacuation conducted in the wild at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the protesters were "in violation of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn has been repulsive and demonstrates that the Bloomberg Foundation is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the motion spokesperson, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The leaders of "Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV program
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will take part in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", succorist in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, next to the "croner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will take part in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV has today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide dissemination on the Internet of a private porn video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crue", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed like the Virgin Mary by supporting in a pot that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appeared as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel de CTV also presents Canada's Bublé singer, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian 'can' during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan was reborn after the earthquake
GDP increases 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still buoyant after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have estimated the material losses of $300,000 million, which, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been reduced.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to finally turn the page: GDP increased 1.5 per cent compared to the previous trimester and 6 per cent at annual rates.
The one registered in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also assumes the largest rate of increase since January to March 2010.
Recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent, compared with the fall in 0.9 per cent of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first withdrawal after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the keynesian impulse that invites you to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use gaps to grow zero.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has become a single market when the yen - the Nippon currency - has become one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors who have fled the debt crisis in the euro area and the unforeseeable forecasts of the United Nations, a privilege that weighs like a halve in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are cheaper abroad, a serious reversal for a country whose economic fleet line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low performance between July and September the Yen contribution.
While markets continue to sit in the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lose its guard.
"There is a need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid assessment of the yen," said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the global economy's inflation points has highlighted that the main powers are being delayed.
Because it dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, down to eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Athens Re-emerges Doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the risk premiums launched and the uncertainty reintroduced in the parks, Greece continues to interfere in the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new government of the transition from Hell is being imposed by the requirements of Brussels rather than by the real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, said yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days established in his appointment could be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, would ensure that he was not going to support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message leaves no doubt about its position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader has gone a step further into his pockets than the EU and the IMF, the organisations that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and has clearly said that he will not approve any letter of commitment to implement the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still upset by the impact caused by Papandreou's entire referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands are firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika would return to Athens "very quickly" to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there was no final date.
The Greeks still have much to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses Spain's "presiding place" with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-renowned place in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose " essence" is in that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings".
The Queen opened yesterday the V-e World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the assurance that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "excessantly necessary" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living with incomes under one dollar a day, to which the "limit of poverty" is set."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originated during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have achieved "many goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for discussion, but also as a platform from which "two basic objectives" must be promoted.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families leave the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see an ongoing evolution", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualifying "family head" meeting in Valladolid on the side of the "poverty bank".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she pointed out that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit to be "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main development cooperation lines".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "trust" to "exclusive people to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for the programme, but was imposed in the fall, particularly to satisfy activists who judge the government's policy too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted in almost unanimous terms.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes at which they were entitled, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile minister of finance, left no doubt.
The idea of the chancellor - and the motion - lies in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less than Europe but more than Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "time has come from a passage into Europe".
This could result from amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Septs quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the jalon is put on.
Similarly, delegates rejected a overwhelming majority of the proposal to weigh each country's weight with the European Central Bank's director according to the weight of each economy, which obviously came to increase the weight of Germany.
Concerned about changing the climate within his party, the chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to win her congress on the back of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except for the crex.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is the fraud of disease arrests?
After the grants, the UMP and the government launch the attack on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - which has been going on since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a will to make savings in a harsh context, but is no less announcer of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on the arrests of the disease.
First of all, for the purpose of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private employees before taking care of a job arrest.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a worker who becomes sick would lose four days' wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but that would make it possible to report 280 million euros, according to Les Echoes.
And that would be accompanied by another more symbolic measure: to impose a day of non-remuneration on staff members in the event of termination of work (they do not have a period of absence up to now, for three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunched the subject of fraud, this time targeting the abuses related to work arrests.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are hired, you will be refunded," Xavier Bertrand warned at the RTL micro, Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work arrest fraud.
This has in fact been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's wait for the national figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were granted in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, daily allowances represented 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with € 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were for disease arrests, or €6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French met on average 14.5 days of work arrest, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by Monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any day of disease arrest.
Another study, this time of disease insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of the disease arrests were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% from above.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are not more inclined than they are to stop work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for health reasons or not) was between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud of disease arrests is very small in the face of black labour.
As far as fraud is concerned, it only reaches a low level.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls on disease arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 made for short-term orders were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of orders over 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of cases were "unadapted or unjustifiable" of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
A total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases, of which several million employees have had a halt to the disease.
A figure that represents very little, for example, of work in black.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, he would be 9 to 15 billion euros missing from tax earnings per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore more than fraud.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to adjust its economy.
That is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said before Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the hundreds of days given to his union government would not be enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
Implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the eurozone "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right to refuse new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right line, supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis on Monday, but prevented his party from engaging in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party, New Democracy.
It agreed with the deficit and debt reduction objectives, and combating waste, but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who has prevented the IMF and the EU from unlocking the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all the parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his speech was sufficient and that it would not sign anything under external pressure.
We need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, a committee of experts says
Canadians live in the denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee demands that governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, and so on, in addition to cancer.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow the assisted suicide and euthanasia, when necessary, to a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey of the United Intelligence Economist, who compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid of dealing with the subject of death".
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are told by the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said they want nothing to change to the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide in persons who are not competent or consenting.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-sponsor of the report, said yesterday at a teleconference, there would be more cases of these floods precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
We recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken for euthanasia because they believe it will allow people to live to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the life of the elderly or the disabled is less valuable.
In the case of persons who have committed suicide, the investigators believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or termination of care in a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Thus, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not a criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect a refusal of care at the end of life, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee demands that governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, and so on, in addition to cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which has already been widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, if it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health law experts have already issued reservations regarding the findings of the report of the Royal Society of Canada's experts.
M. Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, described as "extreme" the position of the report's signatory experts, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminal-phase patients.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would have more than 18 years of age could ask for help in suicide," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Me Deshamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society, he says, there are vats and constraints."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasis manifeste".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly contests data from the report on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave.
Damas denouncing a "compliment"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bachhar al-Assad's supporters protested yesterday in front of the Foreign Department's premises.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria of Bachar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resistance and denouncing a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand in favour of a departure from President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "quit power" in Syria where 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bachar was in the heart of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu has regretted that Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country in respect of which Turkey adopts an increasingly harsh line.
The United States welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, of countries like Turkey are adopting a more and more tough tone" in the face of repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department, observed.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces lost their lives in the Deraa region, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians lost "when shooting and shooting heavy machine guns in Jobar" in Homs City, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, however, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualem felt that the country was "directing towards the end of the crisis".
He also responded strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he considered to be "a no-hazardous".
Syria "will not flinch", he added, ensuring that "the plots against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe has also expressed his support for sending United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he believes is contained in the "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities in preparation for the protest and release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov judged yesterday the decision of the Arab League was "wrong", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while continuing to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for some time on the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "victims", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today's trade unions and employers.
It should establish a relatively restricted office composed of external technocrats in Parliament.
"Monti spoke about an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting the President-in-Office of the appointed Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will be concluded by Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list of, without a doubt, a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying, "some people will be patient and understand the markets."
His appointment by the President had been initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern was echoed in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed prime minister should be a team of technocrats in particular, even though he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, has it considered.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti committed himself, once he came into office, to work in the urgency and in order for Italy to "become a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance goal in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for more stringent measures.
The Italian "pattern" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "teacher" symbolizing "the serious challenge" and another "Italy", according to editors.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy should place EUR 200 billion of state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday a U.S. NGO specialized in nuclear risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported on its "serious concerns" last week regarding a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which was widely used in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Ural, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano diamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA refers to "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system" was "helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during the core of his career in this technology in the military programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence has decreased or decreased slightly, according to FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is 49 per cent increase, against a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews, and an overall increase of 14 per cent in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which are motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," the human rights organization Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", said the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he added, thinking that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in American federal law is an inheritance from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence related to race, colour of the skin, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform, allowing its users, among other things, to observe the activity of those they follow, making its service a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" and another "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly, directly the activity of the other "Twittos", the netizens followed by the messages (" tweets") and those that follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula has been tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast throughout the network on Monday, AFP reported Twitter's spokesperson, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to convey a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the initiative happy, opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of the large public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were suddenly discussing "tweets" about the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom said.
Austria
the inclusion of a "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social-Democratic/Christian Coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any degradation by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It is the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who even announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was reduced only from one crane, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest per year," argued Vice-Chairman and Christian Minister for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Austria therefore submitted a request for the summit in Brussels of the euro area member countries of the last 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then claimed the registration by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of equal value.
The provision adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the federal state's structural public deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present budgets in balance.
The aim is to bring public debt to 60 per cent of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong Yen
Noda is threatening a new intervention on the change market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchange market if the yen should continue to mount.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we detect excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, Mr. Noda explained in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels that led the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively against dollars to lower the value of the Nippon currency that had just established a new record of force since 1945 in front of the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly restored since, doubled by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" in these times of uncertain global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was revised on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro went down under the 105 yen symbolic bar, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This fluctuation of the Nippon currency nights up to the Archipelago's exports because it increases the cost of Made products in Japan and reduces the value of foreign income from Japanese firms when they convert them into national currencies.
"Japan has been fighting to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), said Mr. Noda, who feared that this rebirth of the yen did not kill in the eggs the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a surge in exports and consumption of households that have been hit by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister found that the purchase of yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called for the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Board, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, has prevented BoJ from taking "the appropriate measures", implying that no additional monetary relief was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its Treasury's assets purchases to 55,000 billion (EUR 519 billion) by 5 billion (EUR 519 billion) to the limit of its amounts for the purchase of various financial instruments to cover the liquidity market.
Euro area:
rate fluctuating, stock exchange fluctuating
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is always the European index.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little more into negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt gives 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions on the performance of the euro area States' loans in difficulty, global stock markets continue to make some of their recent gains."
"The investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, with renewed fear of market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has the eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow variation corridor as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This recovery of concerns about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues its decline Tuesday.
The euro has evolved to its lowest level for a month and a half.
At about 10 a.m., the European currency is $1,3570, representing 0.4%.
According to the courts, she withdrew after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting at Congress on Monday, adopted a motion which included the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Italy and Spain's borrowing rates remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the 10-year-old Italian bonds reached 6.85%, that of the same maturity Spanish securities 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, called on the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the market watch line, while Sunday's legislative elections take place in the country.
The gap between the 10-year-old obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new higher level of historicality.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
Statistically speaking, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which is slightly better than the expected 0.3% of households.
However, the Insee revised the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, on the other hand, has recorded a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must take him on the dogmas
If it's a subject that can't be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the shock of emotion, it's energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place where the nuclear is held.
The debate will only benefit if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the reduction of fossil resources will have to be paid in order to continue to produce permanent electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a missing issue of the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which is subject to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor in Switzerland, which is just about to build only last-generation power stations.
On the contrary, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil continue their projects with determination.
The United States, they, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by taking over the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is contrary to the speech.
Berlin's choice will result in a rise in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on imported gas, in particular Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all of these angry effects are already felt.
Denmark's case is to be meditated.
Europe's wind champion, with 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind interference; according to which its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher respectively than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours are paying an electricity bill of more than 40% than that of the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a gap in the maintenance of industrial tools in national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
Thus, any significant reduction in the nuclear share would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power illustrative.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, since they do not show opposition to this energy, surveys show it.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial line of 125,000 direct jobs and 410 000 indigenous jobs.
Highly exportable, it creates a galaxy of SMEs specialising in international markets and makes them very job-creators.
If France had just decided to get out of the nuclear industry, it would have sacrificed many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a source of grief.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to operate for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of production of miraculous electricity, no more than there is no devil.
The development by Areva of low CO2 emission solutions, both nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a Security Authority that exercises intransigence and transparency control over existing power plants as well as the Flamenville building.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the same obsession with security.
In the mid-century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, was involved in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the unforgivable reactor and human error provoked the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of an unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this accident, as it did in the past.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a concept that makes it able to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the electricians who wish to build a power plant, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to get rid of leadership in the irreversible development of the nuclear industry.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and practices of partisanism dominate a debate that is also crucial for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised in various angles - the increasing of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figures policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "the countries of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have done the actual work, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberia of May 23) declaring to the passage that France "does not need foreign talent, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
There is quite a broad consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who stated in 1976 that "90,000,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "could not receive all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish lead hordes was shared to the left as well as to the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be granted to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is able to talk about banalities, indicating that code development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paid in electoral terms; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent publication summarizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration increases growth and the night of employment.
The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace national workers, especially those with limited qualifications, with a downward pressure on their salaries.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than national employees, who are essentially engaged in jobs in the underemployment sectors.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthetists, these supplements between nationals and migrants make arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows results in an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among the Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization believes that in Germany, a 30-year-old immigrant will make a net (less-cost) contribution of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for missing growth points "with teeth".
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, is still thinking about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for inventing it in Athens over two thousand years ago, had experienced the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the goulach, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonists in Greece.
Some have believed that it would be enough, so that democracy will definitely triumph over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it as directly as possible.
We know, since Napoleon, "the Little One", that it was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the necessary condition and can even become "the instrument of oppression" as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Light, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are living in is an economic crisis, but it is, first of all, a crisis in politics and democracy.
The palinoid of the true Greek referendum will have had in this respect a double value: the need for a powerful return of politics, but also the feeling of its impossibility, its incongruity.
This ambivalentity must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from requiring a succession of national referendums, organized to the extent of needs and dispersed.
A white-seen to the absolute European monarch or a jump on foot in the void of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to have cuts, but a joint exercise, full of law, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there would be no more reason to stop the census - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that attaches itself to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which are due to its impossibility and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore to popular sovereignty the pilotage of the European project.
Because, together, Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will involve decisions at European level that will not be made without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle with this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now demanding the European economic government.
Come on.
But thinking about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and living like this by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step towards European construction.
In order to make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The Revolution in the Interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe on an economic level.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "uncontacted" ink are common
The world card parlor opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% of global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone, etc.), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart office.
The most portable segment is that of the wireless technology that allows you to pay for transport in common or to regulate your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million cards with no contact should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is still expected to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for card-to-card (6,925 million cards).
For a long time on the road to the Asia-Pacific region, Europe earns the land for payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double mouth.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards this year without contact.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French establishments have committed themselves to spreading in the future systematically to their customers of the bank cards equipped for the homeless," says Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing the payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the means of paying for the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out transactions.
"They've been late."
"But they should finally know a real exorcism next year."
"We score on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in the world in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a December to June test in Caen.
The iPhone of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a staff authorizing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare the launch of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile phone.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida and the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected of a long time, the links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram confirm.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algeria has now "acquire certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of information services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have updated the passageways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day, along with several of their captors during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the decommissioning of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone holes belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past appeals is aimed at several partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to the investigators: one man to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, a village in Boko Haram and the other man to a man who is called near Aqmi and the sect.
"It is an advance but we must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has benefited from external financial and intellectual support and that it has been increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of more complex cameras or explosive devices and the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of low-interest illuminators.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist religion Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haoussa "Western education is a sin" - presupposes the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is very successful.
It policies and demands strict respect for the Sharia while its militants engage in the fight against the evil central government.
The latter aim first at the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, the Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on the commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, no nuances.
The army invests in the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, who was arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Then the sect will radicalize and leave its fevers from the north.
At Christmas last, she claimed an attack that killed 80 in Jos, then another one in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took over the security QG from the police during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now concerns all security specialists.
While Akmi invested Mali and Niger, which the Somalis of al-Chebab were operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appeared as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and was ready to "share all the information".
World according to Republican candidates to the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an American weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simple ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the tone of statements and shortcomings in foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often not supported - were being forged.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme that is carried in a America experienced by the migration of all of its industry's breads to Asia.
Whether this should involve the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Chinese ambassador to Obama and the only candidate to have a vision of sophisticated foreign policy, failed to cope with an attitude that "flashes" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stays in the depth of the polls, remains inaudible.
In Reagan's image
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he's fancied."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows him a embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently unaware of China's possession of the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike against Iran, is ready to engage the U.S. army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign politics.
The opponents of the current president reflect that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine on anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of Iraqi "boys", on its turbulences in Libya, thus attaching a low label to it.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considered Obama's national security balance rather positive, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been mistrusting military intervention that leads to the insurgency.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to revive its leadership, Obama strikes more precisely.
The North Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with excitement.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part on Tuesday on the shores of the Baltics, between the final orchestra and buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new pipeline that directly connects Russia to Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the valve steering the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km connecting the Saint Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomérania.
A second tube must be completed at the end of 2012, allowing to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same path.
For Gazprom, the completion of this huge building in time and time has a victory air.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land transit through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to shut it down to Western European markets.
In the strongest of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the price of weakening Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In five years' time, Russia knew how to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries, heavily gas-consumers, and whose deposits are in decline.
"This pipeline is an integral part of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," said François Fillon, inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles shown by the leaders of Gazprom, who are present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical operation.
The submarine tube is made of concrete steel to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid land mines dating back to World War II.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed with caution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for North Stream.
The measures to protect the fauna and flora have also had to be multiplied.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts all its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned outside Sweden, but those responsible for the project gave up while the Swedish people were reluctant to see a Russian state company established permanently outside their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we stop the gas transition in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas contained in the gas pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who planned the wetlands to flee every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, trained by a ship for external observation, as well as by a device operating inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigarette, it is inserted inside the tube, a diameter of one metre, and it is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of 3 m2 trip, he provides specific information on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to make the least repair.
Gas flow is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars away, and 100 at arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the stakes.
Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunia and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then hired this company, for twenty years renewables, the total capacity of gas transport.
" Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was secured by shareholders at 30% and by 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be €7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to get back to their costs, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy shoreline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas output door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that reaches before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a stamp.
Founded about 50 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to rediscover the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a madness.
The Moleskine book is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white colour, as old ones over time.
However, the Moleskine book as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company modo modo, based in Milan, decides at the time to launch a design note book but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The book is inspired by an old production technique, the skin soft (tub skin) which denotes a varnish cotton used to cover banquets for example.
This type of book was very taken from writers and travellers.
" Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, up to the 20th century " , says Maria Sebregondi, who became responsible for the brand at Mode Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's difficult to establish a buyer's robot portrait, because the book of notes seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
In Moleskine's image, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, now has almost 100 offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the libraries, from Fnac to small city shops and has been able to impose her identity.
" We have followed the weather and this new need for writing, despite the e-mail rush," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by Moleskine's development: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists expose their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Benefiting from its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer houses... The brand is emerging on a wide range of media.
A success that has been achieved: in the fall of 2006, Mode Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of people with disabilities so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of persons with disabilities is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Discouragement?
“No,” says Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, “the association that organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities.”
" The progress made for 15 years has been considerable. "
" At that time, the rate of unemployment was not two but three times higher."
" However, there is still a great deal to be done."
It must be said that for the disabled, obstacles remain many before access to employment.
Rather, they are older: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low qualification level: 80% do not have the pool and of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to employment, and that are "the node of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for the target brakes.
It remains the non- so-called mentalities that evolve, certainly, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that the managers interviewed had " a low level of knowledge of disability " with " overrepresentation of wheelchair, mental or intellectual disabilities " .
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of workers with disabilities, as set out in a... 1987 Act.
The last known figures, dating from 2008, show a 2.6% ratio.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of " taxed " institutions, like the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc. "
" But this improvement also translates a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of the 20 to 49 employees in employment employ persons with disabilities, compared with 82 per cent of the 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What about happiness"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We won't even write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Assisi side-by-side on the street of the auditorium du Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after the humour of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian selector only has praise for him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and his being Belgian."
"I want to go forward," assures Lillois on his side.
As for the contrast between his benefits in club and selection, "that's all, if he's justified."
"A Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Manned against Romania Friday night for this match against France, Hazard came to Saint-Denis to finally "brighten".
However, without ignoring the notion of "please".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
This will necessarily contribute to further strengthening the "special" character of this meeting.
As in front, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), ", he recalls.
"We crossed at all times."
"To play against them is only happiness!"
With charity, Leekens has for his part mentioned "fierty".
"Feast" of the disputer "a game de gala".
"Fererté" also to note - as "neighbor" - that France is "becomes a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a toner job," he excited himself.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would well share the plane with the Blues management... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to report on it in the next games." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal begins with a lot of optimism its backload towards Bosnia (22h00), Tuesday in Lisbon.
By the way, the two teams had lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selectçao, which has been in the cuffs since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to play.
In view of the match to go (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appeared obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal has dominated the party for over an hour, sure, but it has been unable to mark this goal so precious, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, however, which presents a certain risk because we haven't marked a goal outside."
But at their bright Stage of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a audience that should be so noisy, even though the party is obviously declared "very closed," said an optimistic but bright Bento.
"We are waiting for a very close game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take it up," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in Euro 2012," however relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The new report from Bosnia on Friday obliges the Portuguese to mark and win.
A zero can suffice for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It's a good result, however, which presents a certain risk because we haven't marked a goal outside," said Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to introduce maximum pressure on the Bosnians so as not to " give them time to think."
A good idea, provided it's realistic this time.
