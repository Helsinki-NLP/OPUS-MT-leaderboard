Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they “seem like pillars ”
Some members of the Assembly decided on the proposal to change their name to MWP (for example, Mr Velsos).
This relates to the intention to replace the name of the Assembly as the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly were concerned that this could cause a mockery at the political level.
One member of the Labour Assembly said that his group was concerned that "it is related to Twp and Pwp".
Not to Wales readers: The word "twp" means "sweet", and the word "pwp" means "cake".
The Plaid Assembly member said that the whole group was "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
Velso's conservative claimed that his group was "open" because of the change of name, but noted that it was abbreviation from MWP to "doll".
With the word w, the word w is spoken in the same way as the word u is spoken in the English language of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to replace the title, said: "The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
In 2017, the Law of the Welsh Government granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on the proposals which led to a strong support for the Assembly to be called the Wales Parliament.
With regard to the appointment of members of the Assembly, the Commission has given priority to Members of the Wales Parliament or WMP, but MWP has received the highest support during public consultations.
Members of the Assembly are clearly offering alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement may become a headache for the President-in-Office Elin Jones, from whom it is expected to submit draft legislative amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on the scope of reforms and other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the plan for the disqualification of the Assembly member and the Committee system.
During the debate on legislation, Members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of the name of the country
You will vote on Sunday to change your country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A general vote was held to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued strongly that its northern neighbour's name means claims to the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's efforts to join the EU and NATO.
Contrary to the plebiscite on the replacement of the name, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanovas said he would not vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is simply a price that needs to be paid just to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martyn and other churches suffered from Harlem’s difficulties
“The old people I spoke to said that historically on each corner there was a bar and a church,” Adams said.
– Today you don't find either."
He said he understood why the bars disappeared.
“In these times people communicate differently,” he said.
– Only there are no neighborhood sites where people are gathered all the time."
Speaking of the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained after the sale of the property will not be long enough as expected by the leaders, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
He added that churches can be replaced by multistoreies with cooperative apartments where people will live who will not help the remaining saints.
“Most people who buy cooperative apartments in these blocks will be white,” he said, “and will therefore hasten to the moment when the churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built in 1870 in white congregations, before Harlem became the black metropolis of the metropolis community, and St. Martin’s church was built decades later.
The first white-methodist congregation emerged in the 4th century C.E.
The black congregation, who had prepared the nearby meals, took over the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by the Black Congregation with the priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the minors on 125th Street, at the main Harlem Store, where it was refused to hire or assign blacksmiths to higher positions.
In 1939 the building was severely burned down, but since the parishioners of Johnson’s spiritual father planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
Spiritist David Johnson, son of the spiritual father Johnson, and successor to St. Martin’s church, proud of carilion called the poor.
The experts who played the bat to the carillon called it a "cultural lobby" and "an unchangeable historical instrument".
The University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by the black musician Dionysius A. Linds. 18 years ago he started playing a larger carillon in the church of Riversaida.
Merriweather said that the Church of St. Martyn did not change it to another musician.
What happened in the last few months at St. Martin's church was a complex history of architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by the worlds of the church, and others by the Bishop's bishop.
Zakristija – the umbrella management body composed of world leaders, in July, expressed concern at the bishop that the bishop "will try to pass on expenses" to Zakristija, although it did not include the architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained that the bishop lacked transparency.
A shark in California damaged a receiving lobster at the age of 13
Officials reported that the shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy on Saturday, when he was in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
It was attacked 7 hours ago by Ensinitas in the morning near the Swiss beach.
Chad Hamelis San Diego KSWB-TV told him that he spent about half an hour talking to friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he went out with the group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel told me from the outset that the boy was nervous about getting the closet, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I am being harassed!
I'm inhaling!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his whole key had been broken.
"I began to call for everyone to come out of the water, saying, 'The hawk is floating in the water!'," Hammelis added.
The boy was hit by an airplane in San Diego’s Children’s Hospital, where he was recognized as critical.
What kind of a boy was attacked by a shark, not known.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giless, told the media that a shark had been observed in that area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giless added that the victim had suffered injury to the upper part of the body.
Officers closed the beach from Casablanca Ponto to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
"Sainsbury's" is planning a slave to the UK Beauty Market
"Sainsbury's" takes over "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with the beauty of the world-class shops where specialists will work.
Actively moving to the UK 2,8 billion-weight sterling beauty market, which continues to grow and the sales rates of fashion and household goods are falling, larger beauty stores will be tested throughout the country and, if they are successful, more shops will be installed next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and shopping centers are looking for ways to use the plates, sometimes for televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's reported that it would double its beauty range up to 3,000 product names, including such signs as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and for the first time Dr. PawPaw.
The existing "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" range will also receive more local brand areas similar to those in stores such as "Boots".
The shopping center also re-issues its Boutique make-up range, most of which are vegan – this is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will try discounts at the two Sainsbury's shops, of which the first one was opened last week in Kroid, South London, and the second one will be opened later this year in Sally Oke, Birmingham.
As a result of the purchase of the internet and the desire to buy small quantities of local retail outlets every day, shopping centres need to make greater efforts to attract people to visit it.
Sainsbury’s Director General Mike’s Coupe said that retail stores are increasingly like universal stores, as the shopping centres’ networks are trying to fight the cheaper Aldi and Lidl markets by offering more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's included Argos shops in hundreds of shops and also installed a number of Habitat stores, because two years ago they bought both networks, which allegedly increased the sales of food, and their purchases were more profitable.
The previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical section failed.
In the early first century of this century, Sainsbury's tried a joint company with Boots, but the union ended up arguing how to distribute income from drugstores in shopping centres.
A new strategy arose after Sainsbury's sold the company Lloyds Pharmacy to the owner of the Celesio network three years ago for 125 million pounds.
It was claimed that Lloyds contributed to this plan by adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Sainsbury's Director of Commerce Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We have changed the outer space of beauty and the atmosphere to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
The range of our trademarks has been created in such a way that it meets every need, and because of the attractive environment and comfortable places, we are now an attractive place of beauty that poses a challenge to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "incarcerated" because Holly Willoughby broke off with him 11 million pounds of sterling transaction
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones "incarnate" after the TV show director Holly Willoughby terminated 11 million pounds of sterling transaction with his brand of lifestyle to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
H. Willoughby no longer has time for the "Truly" trademark of their home and accessories.
The couple's business was compared to the Gwynet Paltrow Goop brand.
For 37 years, the Head of the Department of These Morning reported to be leaving in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left a lucrative mark of lifestyle in order to focus on his new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, was upset by the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones.
According to sources, Jones was "inflicted" when at a tense meeting on Tuesday, a gold girl in the capital of his business empire Marlou (Bakingamshire) admitted that due to new transactions of up to 1.5 million pounds (U.S.), she would no longer have time to use her household goods and accessories for the Truly brand.
The business was compared to Gwynet Paltrow’s Goop brand, and it was expected that H. Willoughby would double 11 million pounds of sterling assets.
Since his 37-year-old H. Willoughby "Instagram" reported leaving "Truly", Jones left Great Britain for one of his summers.
The source said that "Truly" has so far been one of Holly's most important priorities.
This should have been her long - term future, lasting over the next few decades.
Its decision to leave was unusually surprising for all.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
The Marlou headquarters is full of ready-to-sale warehouses."
Experts believe that the leading star of The Morning, which is one of Britain's most financially successful stars, can cost the company millions of investments in products, starting with candles and ending with clothes and household items, as well as that it will be late to start everything.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Three children’s mother, H. Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In 2016, H. Willoughby and T. Cappu established "Truly", and 52 years old, P. Jones joined March as President.
Couples leave together, and Mr. Jones has 40% of Baldwin's shares in the production company.
H. Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace ITV director I'm A Celebrity Anta McPartlin.
The close source of Jones said yesterday: "We will not discuss his business."
We talked hard and "then we fell in love"
He laughed about the criticism received from the media about the comment made, which some might view as "unpresidency", as well as about the positive response of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Short refuse so much?
In a short voice, the newly experienced "newsman" said:
"I didn't give up."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June with a view to nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, the nuclear disarmament negotiations strike.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yongs Ho told world leaders on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not have a "response" from the United States for the early disarmament of North Korea.
He pointed out that the United States is continuing its sanctions to maintain pressure instead.
In his short speech, he expressed a much more optimistic view.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
– We're going to fight North Korea.
It would have killed millions of people.
We now support these excellent relations."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had led to positive results: it ended with rocket tests, help in the rescue of the hostages and the return of the support of the American army.
He defended his unusual attitude when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to enter this crowded arena, we'll have about 200 people standing here," Shortas said, pointing to the city in front of it.
In Indonesia, tsunamis and earthquakes devastated the island, killing hundreds of people
As a result of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were notified that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the people of Lomboko were displaced, this was not announced in the national disaster – a necessary condition for providing international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been said very clearly that international aid is not needed and this is therefore somewhat difficult," said Sumbung.
Although "Save Children" is preparing a team to travel to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work on the spot.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency Sotopo said that the Indonesian officials assessed the situation of Paul in order to know whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still not prepared for natural anger.
Although the tsunamis have been built in Acehe, they are not common on other shores.
Because of the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens Paul, despite the warning he issued, was likely to increase the lives lost.
Most of the time traveling between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Because of natural disasters, logistics becomes even more difficult.
A hospital ship located in Lombok, which treats the victims of the earthquake, flies to Pala, but will reach the new disaster site at least three days later.
President Yoko Widodo chose the reconstruction of the broken Indonesian infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign, and he generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not bring peace to the Yoko administration, as it will again take part in the elections in the coming year.
Noko also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are more conservative in form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes because of the use of cats, bows, and other simple weapons by Christians and Muslims on the streets.

Finally, he crossed over the jumping Kep’os Arizabalago and reached the network.
“I just tried to take a position so I could get a ball, and players like Shaqas always play as hard as possible on the front, so I just tried to stay as long as possible for the hit,” said Sturridge’s LiverpoolFC.com.
– I saw the coming in Kant, I fixed the ball in one case and, without much thought, I just sneezed."
After the Belgian star Eden Hazard's 25-minute intruder "Chelsea" was first 1:0.

The number of deaths from Indonesia already reaches 832
As reported earlier Sunday by the country's disaster agency, the number of deaths in Indonesia from earthquakes and tsunamis rose to 832.
The agency's representative for the press at the Sotopo Purwo Nugroho press conference reported that many people had been infected with buildings that would crash due to a 7.5-point earthquake, a 6-metre wave, in ruins on Friday.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was demolished by the collapse of collapsed buildings.

The Parliament's Statue of Cromwell is hit by the last blow of the "rewrite of history" dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the cultural and religious heritage of England by the fanatical followers of Cromwell Puritans, recalling the actions of the Taliban.
However, Cromwell's friend Crick described the proposal as a "crazy" and a "trial to rewrite history".
John Goldsmithas, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “During the current discussions on the transfer of the statue of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Chamber, there had to be an inevitable peace.
Cromwell did not prescribe and execute the iconoclasm of English civil war.
Perhaps not that Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Tom in the past century.
The wonderful image created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a reflection of the 19th century's view and a part of the figure that many still have to admire.
Mr. Goldsmithas "The Sunday Telegraph" said: "Many people, perhaps more than today at the end of the 19th century, were considered to be parliamentarians against external pressure, and this was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether it is accurately illustrated, historians have argued so far.
It is clear that the Middle Ages conflict formed a later development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this tachograph.
The success of the Lord, as he hath defended it, is also worthy of mention and honour."
Pig killed a Chinese farmer dead
According to local media reports, a pig in the Chinese trade attacked and killed a farmer.
On Sunday morning, Morning Post reported that he had found a dead man named Yuan. Because of his damaged artery, he was bleeding and lying next to a pig in the Lippan trade in Guiju Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, the pig breeder in Sining (Cinghaja Province, China) set out to inject the vaccine into pigs.
He reported that on Wednesday, along with his half-brother from the neighboring province of Junano, he was planning to go to the market to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning the half brother found his family dead and found a door to the nearby pighouse.
He said there was a great pig in the pig, whose mouth was covered with blood.
According to the report, the Court’s expert confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had hit a farmer.
"Guyang Evening News" quoted me as saying, "My half brother's legs were bloody and injured," said a half brother named Wu.
The material filmed by the security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
When the man was found, the animal did not belong to Yuan or his half brother.
The manager told Evening News that the pig had to be locked up so that it would not break up with other people and keep up until the police picked up evidence on the spot.
It is reported that the Yuan family and trade authorities are responsible for compensation for their deaths.
Although few, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly injured.
Ten years ago, a boar weighing 295 pounds [295 kg] pushed the Welsh farmer to the tractor and pressured him until the animal was killed by his wife.
After the pigs had gathered a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but may induce an aggressive taste of blood.
“They’re just playful.
She likes to suffer, very subtle... who doesn't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
Hurricane Roosevelts bring a lot of rains to the US in the south
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves across the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring a great deal of rain to all northern Mexico and the United States.
On Sunday from 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa moved 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km south of the Euchenian Gulf (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the Pacific side, it begins to form an extended area of low pressure and moves east, to the west coast of the United States. Since Rosa is approaching the California peninsula on Monday as an atrocious storm, she will start to carry a large amount of atrocious humidity to the north, to the US on the south.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then, in the coming low pressure zone, the humidity of the return will bring in in the coming days a vast flood of rains to the south.
Instead of 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain, it will cause a dangerous sudden flood, flooding, and possible declines in the desert.
Due to high greenhouse humidity in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, it is between 5 and 8 centimeters per hour.
5-8 centimeters of rain are expected in the south-west regions, particularly in the major part of Arizona.
As a result of the rainy nature of the rains, there has been a sudden flood and a rapid deterioration of conditions.
In the event of an emergency, a particularly poor idea would be drawn into the wilderness by foot.
Heavy rain canyons can be turned into boring rivers, and the body can cause wind and dust.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring some local heavy rains to the southern coast of California.
It is expected that more than one inch [1 cm] of crevices can cause a slight drop in flow and the roads can become slippery.
This would be the first drop in the wet season in the region.
Some of the late rains will begin to approach Arizona’s late Sunday and early Monday and then spread the late Monday and Tuesday rains.
The heavy rains after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and South America will fall on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can be intense temperature fluctuations across the United States, because the Arctic is married, but the area of return will be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to major changes in temperature at small distances.
Sunday was an excellent example of the huge differences in temperature in the Central USA.
The temperatures of Kanza Sichi (Misuris) and Omaha (Nebraska) are almost 20 degrees different from those of St. Louis and Di Moino (Ajova).
Over the next few days, maintaining summer heat should again raise and cover more places.
It is expected that in the vast central and eastern United States, from the Great South Plains to the north-eastern areas, the rise of a warm October with a high temperature of 27 degrees.
The New York temperature should rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the east the US temperature will be higher in the first half of October than the average multi-year temperature.
More than 20 million people attended the Bretto Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people on six television broadcasts watched on Thursday as they caught sight of the statements made by the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and by women Christine Blasey Ford in the ninth decade of sexual violence.
However, the political unrest continued after broadcasters interrupted regular programmes on Friday's last minute change: the Arizona Senator had an agreement to conduct a weekly investigation into city charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, who had finished her at the high school evening, grabbed her and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh was furious at witnessing that he was absolutely sure that it was not.
On Friday, Nielsen reported that, possibly, more than 20.4 million people were watching the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching broadcasting through CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulties with people watching television in offices.
To explain more clearly, it is an audience of the same size as it would occur during the football competitions or Oscar awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, led from all networks when the number of viewers reached an average of 5.69 million throughout the day.
ABC, which received 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, CNN 2.52 million.
There was a great deal of interest at the end of the court hearing.
The main figure of the Friday drama was Flake.
After a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, a small Republican office announced that he was arrested on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras, when the protesters called on him, trying to lift him to the Court Committee meeting.
CNN directly filmed it in the eyes of the people who threw it.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
– Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have to say more at the Court Committee meeting.
Later, cable television and broadcasting networks were directly discussed when the Court Committee voted in favour of Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate.
However, Flake said that this would only be done knowing that the FTB will investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which the investigation called for to be carried out by a minority of Democrats.
Flake, speaking to his friend, Senator Chris Coons, was partly convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake took a decision.
The Flake’s choice was valid because it was clear that the Republicans would have no votes to approve the Kavanaugh study.
President Short launched an FTB investigation into suspicions against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister blames criticism of Brexit's "playing politics"
President Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused her of going out of the European Union 'by playing politics' with Britain's future and of harming national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservatories Party Conference in Birmingham (United Kingdom) on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published after her photo on the first page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Brexit Plan for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect tariffs and said it was "full nonsense".
Shooting of Wayde Sims Police arrested Suspect Ditheon Simpson for LSU's death
The police arrested a person suspected of shooting the 20-year-old LSU basketball player in Wayde’s Sims’ death.
Baton Ruže Police Department reported that 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned and charged with his second-degree murder.
The officers posted a video of Sims and Simpson’s encounter, and the police mentioned that Sims had left his glasses during the storms.
The CBS branch of WAFB reports that the police took glasses from the scene and found them on Simpson's DNA.
After hearing Simpson, the police reported that he had killed Wayde.
The lawyer informs that his release security is $350,000.
On Friday, the Eastern Baton Rose Parapia Expert Service issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a bullet in the head, pointing to the neck.
The section is dedicated to the refugee police working group of the State of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University police and the local population who helped during the investigation after which the suspect was arrested.
The Director of LSU Sports Joe Alleva thanked the region for the area's legal protection for "seriousness and the enforcement of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
1,98 m high boy grew up in Baton Rose, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
Last season, the young man placed 5,6 points on average during the game and captured 2,6 volts.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "scattered" and "shocked".
"It's always thought about," Wade said.
Firefighting in the city of Mexico City
Ash fell from Popocatepetil’s fiery furnace, which reached the southern Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to stay away from the firewall when the crater activity was activated and the emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours 183 times.
The center has observed a lot of falls and tremors.
The pictures on the social media show a smooth layer of ash covering the front of the cars in the Mexican neighborhood, e.g. Chočimilke.
The geophysicals noted that 72 km south-east of the capital’s fire activity increased from the time when the 7.1-ball earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The ceasefire, called Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Before the vote on independence, the annual police met with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting against independence with the Russian police and when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mention the first annual separation vote against Catalonia.
A group of shelled separatists stopped the rowing police were covered in egg and powder paints, which caused dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The police used rods to stop the storms that started the day later.
Within a few hours, an independence group singing "Unforgettable, Unforgivable", met with Union Protestants who shouted, "Living Spain!"
The local press reported that fourteen people are being treated for minor injuries caused by protests.
A year after 1 October, a referendum which Madrid regards as illegal, but which is denouncing by the Catalan separatists, the tension in the region of independence remains high.
The majority of voters have decided to become independent, but because of a large majority of the vote, the number of boys who did not want to separate was low.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year nearly 1,000 people were injured by police throughout the region in an attempt to stop voting in the electoral district.
On Friday night, an independent group set up a camp to prevent demonstrations by national police.
The demonstration took place but had to change the route.
68-year-old electrician Narcissus Termess, who was involved in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer true about Catalonia's prospects of independence.
"Last year we survived one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cheer up to vote, but now we're upset," he said.
Despite the vital and difficult achievement of the victory in the regional elections in December of last year, it was difficult for the parties to the independence of Catalonia to survive this year when many of their most famous leaders withdrew into a voluntary trial or are detained and awaiting the trial on the role of the referendum and later on the proclamation of independence.
With the support of the police, 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puigs, filming a protest on his phone, said that the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"Temperature is constantly growing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriolis Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he will be in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Initiating the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londoner. Men entering the house by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after reentering London.
The incident took place Thursday around 7.30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself had been damaged.
At a certain point in time, the car could also be shot or flew.
The Mengos hit secured Livingston's victory 1:0 against "Rangers"
"Livingston" player Dolly Menga's first match guaranteed victory
In the upper league, Livingston was surprised by the Rangers, forcing Steven Gerrard to lose the second of the 18 matches, the leader of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengo's hit was very important because Gary Holto's team compared it to "Hibernian".
The Gerard team will meet with the Leaders of the Hearts, from which they will remain at eight points during this season of the Premier League.
Earlier Thursday, Rangers European League games at home with One Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended its unparalleled series of unparalleled games in the division to six, and the senior coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of losing, as Kenny Miller changed only last month.
"Livingston" the chance of a pro-gap in matches with static guests
Before the intrusion of the Holto team due to its resistance to the various problems of the Rangers, it was long overdue.
At first, Scott Robinson knocked and knocked on the door, and later Alan Lithgow was unable to reach Craig Halkett’s head with the ball passed over and he ran right next to the door.
The owners, allowing Rangers to play in front, were not upset because they knew that they could cause trouble to the guests by creating standard situations.
That's the way it's been infiltrated.
"Rangers" passed the free blow and "Livingston" took the lead; Declan Gallagher and Robinson shared the ball with Mengai, and this stopped him from making a profit in the middle of the courtroom.
Since then, the ball has been controlled by Rangers for a long time, but the protection of the owners has been ineffective and the work of writer Liam Kelly has almost been done.
Such a wave continued in the second stage, although Kelly had to work to find Alfredoed Morelos' knock on the door.
Scott Pittman shot "Rangers" gunman Allan McGregor broke his leg, and after another standard "Livingston" hit Lithgow, the ball flew by the door.
While the ball was being handed over, the Livingston penalty was constantly on the scene, but every time it was suspended, and the two requirements for the penalty were not satisfied because of Halket's encounter with Glenn Middleton after the change, and because of the ball's fate.
Analysis of the phenomenon of Livingston
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from the Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenon of Livingston is a game and result.
For all up to one they were great and continued beyond expectations for the ever-increasing game.
The styles of the game and the staff from the return to the highest league have not changed much, but great merit should be given to Holt because when he arrived he set the team on fire.
He's got a lot of big men talking to him.
Captain Halkett was a great player, focused on a well-organized defense, and Menga was worth Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall not to lose consciousness.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play well under Gerard’s direction, this time they missed their level very much.
They had little to do with the decisive blows and only one time they had broken through the defense of the owners. Some anxiety calls were made to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Kelne agreed to a variety of
On Saturday (September 29th), there were smiles and blue skys when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for lunch in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's counter-visit to Germany when it was intended to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued about problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open up a new great mosque.
The largest Turkish population is located outside Turkey.
The police banned 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque for security, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to accept it in their own country.
Different protests indicate the breakdown of visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero and others call him a dictator.

Long Lartino Prison. Six officers injured during the riot
The Prison Service reported that six prison officials were injured during a major break in the prison of special security men.
Suirutė took place in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vusteršyr on Sunday around 09.30 a.m. BVL, where it continued.
Special Tornado officers were called on to manage this riot involving eight prisoners and taking place on one wing.
Officials are treated for minor facial injury at the site.
A representative of the Prison Service said: "In order to manage the ongoing incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison personnel were called up.
Six staff were treated for injury.
We are intolerant of violence in our prisons and we are ensuring that responsible people will be handed over to the police and, possibly, spend longer time than playing."
The HMP Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, police officers were sent to prison to take control of a serious riot, during which some workers were covered with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Solt Letik Siči with its sudden floods (it can be useful for beautiful areas)
It is not customary for a relapse depression to hit Arizona, but it is likely that it will happen next week when Hurricane Rosa with her remaining energy will collapse in the south of the desert and this will result in a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorology Service has already announced to observe the sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, which is heading south and east of Nevada, southern California and Jutos, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Solt Leik Site.
On Monday, it is expected that Rosa will be drawn to Phoenix on Tuesday as she approaches the rain.
In Phoenix, the National Meteorological Service noted that “only ten cyclones have maintained the state of reversing or reversing depression no more than 322 miles [322 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane not more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict that an increase of 5 to 10 centimeters will occur and a drop of 5 centimeters will occur in some areas of Arizona Mogolon Rim.
Other areas of the desert south-west, including central Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to range from 2.5 to 5 centimeters and may fall to up to 10 centimeters.
For people who are not affected by the sudden storms, the rains of the Rose can be blessed because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some may benefit from these falls because they are currently suffering from droughts in the south.
According to the data from the U.S. drought monitoring centre, a little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from very high drought, and this corresponds to the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels to the coast across the California peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still similar to the hurricane category of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of the Gulf of Euchenia (Mexico) and is moving to the north at an hour’s speed of 19 km.
The storm is facing colder waters in the Pacific region and is therefore serious.
So it is expected that it will reach the coast of Mexico with a rainstorm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In some parts of Mexico, waste can be severe and pose a high flood risk.
"From the California peninsula to the north-west Sonora is expected to wait between 8 and 15 centimeters, but possible things – and up to 25 centimeters of falls," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will withdraw to the north through Mexico as an atrocious storm, then, on Tuesday morning, will reach the Arizona border as an atrocious depression, and on Tuesday evening, during Arizona, she will withdraw to South Jutos.
"The main risk expected from Rosa or its residues is a very high amount of rain in the California peninsula, in the North West Sonor and in the US desert in the South," the National Hurricane Centre reported.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening sudden floods, torrential rains in the deserts, and declines in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsamer Norton. Arrested four people suspected of attempted murder
A three-year-old and a 20-year-old man was detained by a suspected attempt to kill after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton in the "Excelsior" terrace area, approximately 04.00 according to the BVL, on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now stable.
The Eivono and Somerset police reported that at night a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area.
Officials have contacted any person who can have any cell phone filmed material about what happened.
In short, Kavanaugh said that he was "punishing against the democracies of the party of vices, anger".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that we would like to reject the cruel and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Short said in his speech in Willing, West Virginia.
In short, Kavanaugh said that during his candidacy process, he "was suffering the ills of the Democratic Party, anger".
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday to the convention strictly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her a few decades ago when they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing of the Court of Justice on his allegations.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans that day saw Kavanaugh’s hairy, good - looking, and courageous faces.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, that is a lawyer who has a reliable reputation for public services,” he said.
The President pointed indirectly to the candidacy of Kavanaugh, together with the importance of the mid-term elections of Republicans.
"There have been five weeks of important elections in our lives.
I'm not participating, though I'm really involved,' he said.
- That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
A brief statement was made that the Democrats were seeking to "oppose and prevent".
The Senior Assistant Head of the GOP CNN said that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims continue to grow as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
The authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many were killed because of the massive waves that hit the Indonesian Slavic Islands, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the beach.
Hundreds of people gathered at the city beach festival on Friday, when they took a six - foot - high [6 m] wave to the shore. Most of them were killed and destroyed everything they had found on the road.
After the tsunami, a 7.5-point earthquake occurred.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” said a representative of the BNPB Indonesia's disaster reduction agency at the time of the information report in Jakart.
“Cunamis didn’t tear itself apart, he pulled cars, bars, houses, he hit everything that was on the ground”, Nugroho said, adding that, before he hit the shore, the open sea ran 800 km/h.
He said that some people got into trees to avoid tsunamis and survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 - Paul - based centers.
The photographs of the accident agency showed that a number of buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were left and broken, and the cat was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the city of the sea continued to be shaken by repeated blows.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported that, on Friday, the energy released during a particularly strong earthquake was about 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb, which will hit Hirošima during World War II.
It was reported that the tsunamis could have been strengthened due to the city’s geographical situation, as it lay at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nagroho described the damage as "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He said that some bodies of victims had been found trapped in the ruins of buildings, later added that 540 people were injured, and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the victims may be higher along the coast than 300 km north of Pala, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Nugroho said that the communications networks "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information was received" from Dongal.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," said the representative of the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers are going to disaster-affected areas.
It has been said that "this can already be seen as a tragedy, but the situation can get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticized for not being aware that the tsunami struck Paul, although officials said that the wave was triggering a warning.
In general, the social media content likes to hear a man standing on the top floor of a building calling for a coming tsunami on the street below.
Within a few minutes, the water wall will crack into the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately approve the filmed material.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, the supply of electricity was disrupted and communications networks around Pala were withdrawn and it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate the provision of aid.
The authorities reported that an army from Jakarta and other cities began sending cargo aircraft with aid supplies, but the evacuated person still needs food and other essential items.
The airport was reopened only to provide aid and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeded 800.
That's very bad.
Doseba reported that when World Vision staff from Dongal safely traveled to the city of Palu, where workers were sitting in the homeless tents built in the yard of the office, the images were taken up.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups began taking difficult steps to provide disaster relief, some people complained that experienced foreign aid workers were forbidden to travel to Pala.
According to the Indonesian regulations, financing, provision and staff employed abroad can only help when the disaster site is announced in the national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is still an accident at the provincial level,” said the representative of the Indonesian Red Cross to the press Aulia Arriani.
– When the government says, “Yes, this is a national disaster”, we can call for international aid, but such status has not yet been published.”
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the deceased hoped that their loved ones would be part of a miracle that would affect the history of natural disasters.
A small boy was taken out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was confined to her mother’s body for two days.
Coach Gendon Subandon of the Indonesian national team of paramilitary sports team was trained by two Asia-based paramilitaries who ended up in Indonesia earlier this month.
Other of the intruders at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Monday, were his students.
"As an elder in the field of sports, I bear my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told us a few hours ago about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, and he passed this knowledge on to the community of sports. He was desperate to send messages using the WhatsApp program, to the Palu competitors who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages contained only one gray, not two blue feathers.
"I think this means that messages have not been received," he said.
When filling in the ATM, Newport on the Levee stole 26 750 US dollars
According to a press release from the Niuport Police Department, on Friday morning the thief stole 26 750 U.S. dollars from an employee from Brink's who filled out a ATM at the entertainment center Newport on the Levee.
"The car driver was an ambitious ATM in the entertainment complex and willing to add more money," said Detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
While he was busy, another man "resisted behind the back of the Brink's employee" and stole the money bag.
According to the press, the Witnesses observed a number of suspects who fled the scene, but the police were unable to determine the number of persons involved in the crime.
Any person who has information about their identity should contact the Niuport police by telephone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. Reperis changed his name to Ye
Reperis Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
After announcing on Saturday the changes in Twitter, he wrote: "A person formerly known as Kanye West".
For 41 years, K. West has been known as Ye and on this behalf has named the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began before the show "Saturday Night Live", where West was expected to present its new album "Yandhi".
This is what he has to change the singer Ariana Granda, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the show.
This is not just a shortcut to the current professional name – K. West said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
"I think "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," – this year K. West previously said about the name of the album with Radio Director Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and turns simply Ye, which means our good, evil, panic, all of it.
The album reflects more of what we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his priority for Love and Brotherly Love.
Former West colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a brush and in capital letters.
Mexican policy Andrés Manuel López Obradas (abbreviated AMLO) promises not to use war against civilians.
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obradar, promised never to use military forces against civilians when the country is approaching 50th blood pressure against students every year.
On Saturday, López Obradar promised at the "Tlatelolco" site "never to use military forces to disturb the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, when the movement of left-wing students started in Latin America, military representatives in the field shot at a peaceful demonstration and 300 people were killed.
López Obradar made an outstanding promise to support the young Mexicans by subsidizing the students each month and opening more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of education include young people in criminal groups.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
"Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount released for research in this field," says the investor and artificial intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who works on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were received after the various US government authorities published reports on artificial intelligence, even though the US is generally not an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year, the aim of which was to take the lead in the field of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The doubled research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the USA and are expected to have another breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that another great achievement of artificial intelligence will be the United States, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Artificial Intelligence Superstates: China, Silicon Valley and New World Orders" this month released Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director General of the Sinovation Ventures, investing in one of China's most famous artificial intelligence companies "Face++".
In the 1980s, he worked with an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the top-ranking U.S. player Othello, and was later head of Microsoft Research and the President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognised previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asked when to find more insightful people.
Lee said that US scientists often have to work hard to win state grants.
"This is not China's taking academic leaders – it's companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired bright minds from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy can also help the US strengthen its efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctors working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China published its New Generation artificial intelligence development plan.
In addition, Lee said that the Chinese National Science Fund is funding academic institutions, similar to the National Science Fund and other government organisations are providing money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, the purpose of which is to involve partners from the industrial and academic community, and the White House announced that a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence would be set up.
This month, DARPA (the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency) announced an investment of US$ 2 billion for the "AI Next" initiative.
NSF is currently investing more than 100 million US dollars a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, nothing has been done in the coming months about US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
The Macedonians vote in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonians voted in Sunday's referendum on whether to replace the name of the country with the name of the Republic of North Macedonia, that would be an action to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which blocked its efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents claims to the territory of Greece and the veto of Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments agreed on the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that the change of name would prejudice the ethnic identity of most Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanovas said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether the voter's activity would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to enter into force.
A referendum on the voting card has been tabled: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU in favour of an agreement with Greece?"
The name change sponsors, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that have fallen behind Yugoslavia, is worth the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska in Skopje for 79 years.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the results of the vote and make them decisive.
The name is to be changed to two-thirds of the majority of Parliament required.
The National Electoral Commission reported that there were no reports of infringements up to 1 p.m.
However, the number of voters reached only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voters from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaevas, his wife Zorica and his son Duška vote in a referendum on the change of the country's name to open the way to stand in NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of the tents built by the boycotting referendum.
"We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up rather than enter the service door," said Kavadarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can return to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in the integration of the Eurasia."
Prime Minister Zaevas says that NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent, will attract the necessary investments.
"I believe the vast majority will be for, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaevas said.
He said the result "Yes" would be "to ensure our future".
According to the polling results published by the Macedonian Research Institute last Monday, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters should participate in the referendum – less than the required number of voters.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV Telma, 57% of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of them said they would vote "Yes".
In order for the referendum to take place successfully, 50 per cent of voters must participate in it plus one vote.
If the referendum did not succeed, it would have been the first serious failure of the pro-Cyprus government policy since it took over power last May.
Look at: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero overcomes all of Brighton's defense and profit mix
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defense, and the Manchester City team on Saturday, playing Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, won the match at 2:0.
Aguero's 65-minute infiltration seems to be incredibly easy.
The Argentine attacker received the ball in the middle of the square at the start of the attack.
Before he went into the open field, he passed between three Brighton defenders.
At that time, Aguero was surrounded by four green-towed players.
He ran through one defender before the same Brighton penalty court on the side of a few others.
Then he transferred the ball to the left where Sterling was.
An English attacker with one spear returned the ball of Aguero from the penal court and this right-legged hit launched the ball to the right side of the gate network, overcoming the Britishton miner Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has a problem with his feet," said "City leader Pepas Guardiola.
– We talked about him playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky that he earned a fortune that moment."
However, it was Sterling who helped Sky Blues to push forward the first of these Premier League matches.
The raid was earned at 29 minutes.
At the time of the attack, Aguero received a ball at the depth of the Brighton Square.
In addition to the left side of the square between the two opponents, he beautifully passed the ball to Leroy’s Sane.
In several caves, the ball turned forward until Sterling moved toward the further rope.
The Sky Blues attacker launched the ball at the door just before he got out of the field.
On Tuesday, 12 a.m. 55, "City" meets with the Hoffenheim Champions League team at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Zinsheim (Germany).
Sherzer wants to play friendly games with Rockies
After "Nationals" has fallen out of the competitions, there is no longer any serious reason to force it.
The contestant Scherzer expects to win Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has the opportunity to remain in the competitions; in the national league "West", they score "Los Angeles Dodgers" one point.
“Rockies” on Friday evening with the result of 5:2 winning “Nationals”, at least already secured the chance to get a discounted passport, but will still have to try to ensure the right to play in the first division.
"Although we are playing about nothing, at least we will be able to escape to the ground knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where the crowd of people and other teams will be gathered, will probably be at the highest level that we will be able to achieve this year.
Why don't you get sick?"
The initial composition of the Sunday competition team "Nationals" has not yet been published, but in this case they are clearly willing to throw the ball out of Scherzer.
Sherzer, who will have 34th in this competition, became a year-old coach and a medical position for him to take a normal day of rest on Sunday.
Statistics of the right-wing Washington season: 18-7, 2,53 ERA and 300 cars per 220 2/3 lift.
A Brief Speech in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the electoral activity of Republicans in the mid-term elections, the President shall note indirectly the situation regarding the appointment of Bretto Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“All we have achieved will be on the table in November.
The most important elections in our lives remained for five weeks.
It's very important, I'm not running... but I'm really running, that's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Then he went on: – You see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, you see how this is happening right now.
And they're willing to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how angry it is.
They don't care what they've hurt, what they've crossed to gain power and control; that's what they really want – power and control – but we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "oppose and prevent".
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "bad, bad, landfills and wrong people."
He referred to the Senate Courts Committee, referring to the name of Senator Diane’s Feinstein, as a result of the massive hearings.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Eh, um, how.
No, um... no, I'm waiting for one – it was really simple body language – the simplest body language of all I've ever seen."
The liborists have lost a variety of opinions.
They do not tolerate those who openly express their views
When the moment activists in my local party voted for my mistrust, I say, whether this was to be monitored.
Finally, I am the latest of the Leborist MPs who have been told that I am undesirable – and this is for what I have said.
My fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan faced similar threats because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
My disbelief was expressed in criticizing me for not meeting Jeremy Corby.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironic, on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the former leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want many members to be included in the meetings and that the meetings will be productive."
Most of those eight years, when I was a local parliamentarian of the Labour Party, the meetings of the GC on Friday evening were exactly the same.
It is regrettable that today the tone of many meetings is not quite so much so that the promises of a "seriouser, more pleasant" policy have been forgotten long ago, even if at all times they have begun to be fulfilled.
It is increasingly evident that the other opinion in the Leborist Party is intolerable and that each opinion is assessed according to whether it is acceptable for the Party's leadership.
This started shortly after the party leader became Jeremy, and colleagues, who, as I thought before, had similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and follow opinions that I would never agree with – either on national security or on the EU single market.
As soon as I speak in public – and even if I don’t care what it is – the social networks are investigating violations that encourage my withdrawal, condemn the central policy and say I’m not a member of the Leborist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I have achieved something far more than some of my colleagues because my comments are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure every day the scourge of sexist and racist insults.
One of the most disappointing things in this political era is how violations have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyna said last week that the Leborist party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the same party of views, and with every "untrustable" procedure or amendment of the electoral system, this party is becoming less and less and less.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice that encourages not to jump out, not to speak so loud, and then "all will be fine" with me.
But that's not why I came to politics.
Since I joined the Leborist Party 32 years ago, as a scientist, I have been provoked by the negligence of thatcher government, which is why my whole school class is really breaking down in that sense, I have sought to save better public services for those who need them most – whether they are a member of the local council or a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including the last elections.
No Nottingham East should have been surprised in any way by my political opinions and disagreements with the current leaders.
For those who have promoted this procedure on Friday, I can say that when the country is heading towards Brexit, from which the households, businesses and public services are going to suffer, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leborist Party.
But in fact, one message I have for my voters, the Members of the Liberal Party (or not): I am proud to serve you and promise that no threats to the withdrawal or political accuracy will keep me acting in accordance with my beliefs and your best interests.

“Air”- “Melrose” – 38:17 Unaffected “Air” prevents tabletops
Two late tests have distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Air has earned the impressions of this triumph at the Tennent's Premiership Day.
The team now appeared at the top of the table – the only one not defeated.
Finally, they were given an unsurpassed defense and a well-used opportunity, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We've taken all the tests through all the competitions that have taken place so far, and we're still not able to overcome, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said: "Air" turned out to be good, players took advantage of their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, which was successfully completed by Frazier Clima, led to Air, but the yellow card for Rory Hughes, which was released by Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect the numbers and Baggot to stop the unsuccessful test.
The climate increased the advantage of Air when before, through the middle of the competition, it earned points and successfully completed the personal test by helping Air before the break-up result 17:5.
However, Melrose's second generation was not bad, and Patrick Anderson's trial, which was successfully completed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
The competitions were suspended for a longer time because Ruaridhas Knotta experienced a serious injury and was kicked out of the hall on the bench. After the extended air race continued to advance when Stafford McDowall finished the trial successfully.
Captain Blair Macpherson received the yellow card, and Melrose tried to use the player's surplus, but Bruce's Colvine's test was unsuccessful after the low pressure.
The home team player returned, however, after receiving a yellow card to Struan Hutchinson for stopping the climate without a ball, MacPherson pressed the ball from the fine line for the flying air.
The climate successfully completed its test, as it had already done since almost the beginning of the race, after Kyle’s Rowe held David Armstrong’s spear to the corner of the square and prevented the country’s attacker Gregor Henry from holding the fifth round of the house team to win points.
Still Game star, apparently ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
The silent game star Fordas Kiernanas appears to be ready to move to the housing and food services sector, after explaining that the director of the licensed restaurant company was appointed.
A 56-year-old man in the popular BBC comedy plays Jack Jarvis, writes the script and plays with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of this show, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Kriiglang.
According to official data, he became the Director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although the sources of "Scottish Sun" pointed out that Kiernana was looking for ways to engage in Glazgo's "smoothed restaurant business".
"We belong to the sea": Bolivia in exile hopes that the court will reopen its way to the water
The sailors patrol the ship at La Pase.
The flag of the sand of the water is floating on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the base of the sea is filled with a shout: “We are legally owned by the sea.
It is our duty to restore it."
In all of Bolivia's landlocked memories of access to the water, which had to be sacrificed to Chile in the 19th century in the bloody conflict over resources, are still alive and will be reborn in the Pacific.
In recent decades, the hopes for peace have now been greatly strengthened, as after five years of consideration, Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be published on 1 October.
"Bolivia has a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, wishes to see positive results," said Bolivia's diplomat Robert Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens throughout the country will monitor the publication of the TTT decision on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will take a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate on Bolivia’s access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, is an Indian who is awaiting a counter-election campaign for re-election, and is very interested in the outcome of the decision on Monday.
"We are very close to being able to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts are inclined to believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take a decision in favour of Bolivia, even if it does, there is little change.
The United Nations authority established in the Netherlands has no power to land its territory in Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the TTT decision will only be published six months after the last arguments have been heard is unlikely or shows that the case was "not difficult", said Paz Zárate, expert on international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia had been able to do something about it, the last four years could have blocked it back.
"This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She believes that any remnants of Chile's good will have been destroyed by the crusade of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation during a while, but after all, it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court’s decision was taken in an unusually rapid manner.
"In the spring, Bolivia will have the unique opportunity to start new relations with Chile and to put an end to the 139-year conflicts for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the sea as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never deny the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to agree with the past."
North Korea claims nuclear disarmament is possible only if it can trust the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho believes that his people will never give up the first nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises to which the leaders of the rival countries agreed at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments were made at the time when Secretary of State Mike Pompey apparently intended to renew the instigated nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting Kim Jong Unu in Singapore.
Ri says that "a utopian dream" is that by continuing sanctions and by refusing to declare Korea's end of the Korean war, North Korea could ever be bypassed.
Washington is not in favour of the declaration unless Pchenjan first of all takes credible disarmament action.
Both Kim and US President Donald Short want to hold a second meeting.
But a widespread sceptical opinion is that Pchenjan is not seriously going to give up the arsenal that the country seems to see as the only security guarantor.
Pompeii intends to visit Pchenjane next month to prepare the soil for the second meeting of Kim and Short.
Paris fashion show revealed that the latest trend is massive head coverings, and they will soon close the nearest fashion shops
If you want to add your bird collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, this trend is just like you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentricly large head coverings in their spring and summer collections, and he simply decorated his style with Paris fashion week viewers.
These particularly impractical writers closed the social network "Instagram" this summer and these designers presented eye-catching works on the floor.
The distinguished creation of Valentine was a huge body-coloured bird, decorated with a wide, pendant edge that captivated the mannequin’s head.
Other non-standard size accessories were arbuses, beads and even pineapple – but they were not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange rubber – at the same time to Helovin.
Many colored masks were tied with lips and reminded Hannibal of Lecter rather than of high fashion.
One of the works looked like a member’s costume, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other recalled the soluble ice gap.
And if you get this huge trend of fashion – don’t ask.
Styling experts hope that these large envelopes can be accessed to shops.
The big birds were still popping up with the La Bomba high-ends, and the two-legged birds were already wearing – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand of goods, created by highly impractical airplanes, which blocked all social networks, on the floor released another large piece – a narrow beach basket, almost the same size as the one wearing it to wear a bathing suit.
The basket of red-plated repuffs, decorated with rappers corners and a white leather handle, became the exclusive accent of the Jacquemus collection "La Riviera SS19" in the Paris fashion week.
Famous Stylist Luke Armitage, FEMAIL, said: “I think that the next summer, a large barber and beach bag was lifted up to the store, because the designer had such a great impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard size accessories.”
John Edward: "The payment of talks is an extremely important education for the citizens of the world"
Scotland’s independent schools have improved the record of academic achievements in 2018 and have demonstrated once again the exceptional results of the exams, which have only been further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community merits.
When more than 30,000 students are taught throughout Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), aims to provide its students and their parents with the highest level of services.
Independent schools aim to train their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to be citizens of the world.
As we work in the education sector, which can create and implement the school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and that they are readily available in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you can speak to a person in a language he understands, he will understand you.
If you speak to him in his own language, you shall speak his own heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot only speak English if we want to build trust and trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's recent exams, languages are excellent in higher education and independent schools with the best maintenance ratings.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language learners received the highest A assessment.
Data collected from 74 schools, which are members of SCIS, showed that 72 per cent of students received the highest A assessment in Mandarin, 72 per cent of those who learned German, and 69 per cent of those who learned French and 63 per cent of those who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland take the view that foreign language is a key skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as an item of choice is now considered to be as important in independent school programmes and elsewhere as basic things (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17 per cent of all the reasons why employers were difficult to fill were insufficient language skills.
As a result, speaking skills are becoming more and more mandatory for young people to prepare for their future careers.
As employment in the future will be highly dependent on language, these skills will become essential in a globalizing world.
No matter what career a person chooses when he learns another language, he will in the future be much more advanced than others if he has the skills needed for his whole life.
As you can communicate directly with people from other countries, learning a few languages will make you much more competitive.
According to a survey conducted by YuGov in 2013, involving more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 per cent were not able to speak in a foreign language well enough to participate in the conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken in a two-digit number of people, i.e. 15 per cent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
In teaching a number of languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school varies according to the language they are taught.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages and others teach languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom in view of the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in an independent school with training staff and specialists in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are prepared to develop a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to live in the future.
There is no denying that languages remain in the global business environment today for the future of a country of vital importance, and this is also necessary in the education system.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity to choose, diversity and results for young people in Scotland.
This must be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will start the show "Lakers" on Sunday.
There was little waiting for the fans to see how LeBron James would start the season of Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton reported James playing Sunday season opening games with Denver Nuggets San Diego.
But how precise a game is, I'm not clear yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said that James is likely to play for a limited time.
As early as this week, James was asked about the plans in the Lakers team during six pre-season competitions.
"I no longer need pre-seasonal competitions at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Short speech in West Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Short this evening starts his campaign in Willing, West Virginia.
This is first of five planned short-term languages next week, including suspensions in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In adopting the procedure for suspending the nomination of a candidate of his chosen Supreme Court, the short-term aim is to concentrate support in the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republics have been threatened with losing control in Congress in November.
The next hour this evening will be a short talk in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
In short, Villinge, West Virginia, planned 19 hours in the morning evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch short speech on the West Virginia Internet in the following broadcast “YouTube”.
The theme of the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh is likely to fall short of this week, because it has suffered a lot of tension over the suspicions of improper sexual behaviour when the Senate voted for the suspension of the candidate until the week before the FTB conducts the investigation.
But the main objective of this campaign is to help the Republics gain some strength in the coming November elections.
Therefore, the representatives of the President's short campaign say that the purpose of these five meetings next week, as announced by Reuters, is to "energize volunteers and supporters who seek to defend and extend the majority of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is so important in its agenda that the president will go to as many countries as possible, as the campaign season begins very hot," said a representative of the Short campaign, unwilling to reveal his name.
"The language planned for this evening in the Wesbanco arena should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of Pittsburgh media," says Metro News in West Virginia.
On Saturday, for the second time in the last month, I will visit West Virginia, where I won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
A brief attempt is being made to help the candidate of West Virginia to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who, according to polls, is in the rankings.
“It’s not a good sign to Morrisey that the president had to come to take him to the top of the rankings,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, as Reuters reports.
2018 Ryder Cup Tournament Tournament: US team assigned soldiers and expected to enter Sunday unit races
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the fourth could be just what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a success swing is completely designed, but players really believe it, especially in such competitions as this.
So whose side is success now?
"They were first six points, and now four, so I think we can keep it that way," said Jordan Spiethes, preparing for the day.
Europe, of course, is the first, has four points and is still waiting for twelve matches.
American enthusiasm, says Spietho, is expanding, and they do not miss it, no longer speaking of the shape of Spietho and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each gathered three points out of four.
The muscle was intact from the beginning to the end and guided unrelentingly.
As the round continued, the wilds won all the fame. To finish the fourth match, Thomas earned two points out of two possible ones.
His blow, after winning them in this match in the 15th dome, was accompanied by similar whispers that said the end of the American team was not yet threatening.
"You just have to concentrate and take care of your own rivals," Spiethas said.
Now each of these players had to play separately.
Until the successful end is 18 gifts.
The only players who have collected more points for Spythe and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the story of the Ryder Cup is not disputed.
A strange but beautiful couple from Europe have gathered four points out of four possible and can be quiet.
Moliwood was the only couple who needed additional hits not only on Saturday afternoons but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings.
These events and the reaction of the glamorous viewers only confirm that they will be the players who win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who have the chance to win Europe after the last launch of the Le Golf National field.
It would be good to achieve both at the same time in different parts of the world.
Even though we are talking about Europe's glory too early.
Bubba Watson and Webba Simpson played briefly with Sergio Garcia, a four-ball clubyard in the morning when he was faced with Alex Norena.
An additional blow and two additional blows during the first nine rounds caused Spain and Sweden to suffer, from which they were unable to escape.
But no one will ever get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four balls and four cats are so interesting to watch for interoperability between couples, for advice that they give and do not give, and for the strategy to change at a moment.
Europe was better at playing as a team, so it came to the final in a resolute way, but this fourth stage also showed that the US team has a pillar of combat, which has been questioned by some, especially in the countries.
Last Ryder Cup Day Europe top 10:6
Europe will meet the last Ryder Cup Day with a major breakthrough, after the sixth stage of the fourth stage leading towards the United States result 10:6.
Inspiring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario's duet continued to warm the atmosphere by winning two victories against the heavily fighting Tiger Woods and took the lead in the four points of Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, in order to preserve the trophies that Hazeltine had lost two years ago, was playing in the fourth match in the morning before the failed American side and the stage ended with 3:1.
The U.S. demonstrated more opposition in the squares when winning two cats but unable to overcome the points' balance
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12th unit cats to keep the trophies in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist who managed to win four points in a row, when Molinari and Molliwood doubled after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points during their first four cats in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the square, they unquestionably disturbed the confidence of the lost Woods and the new American Brison Dechambeau at 5:4.
Woods, not so overcoming two Saturday cats, at some times showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his cats in four, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose fell asleep in the morning and came back to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the fourth; they won 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, taking the first and third place in the world rankings.
Whatever a pleasant, mild windy day in southwestern Paris, Europe is not going through the butter.
Three times the winner Jordan Speethes and Justin Thomas set up a card for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
The four-ball sword they sought an easy victory by 2:1 against the Spanish John Rachma and Ian Poulter, and the fourth sword defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy’s result by 4:3 without hitting the ball in the first two gifts.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to regain the balance of the four points by going to the single cats, although the Fury side had enough equal to maintain the trophies.
Although it was two days in the second place, the success of Sunday seemed to be a failure.
North Korea says that in no way are armed unilaterally, without trust
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their lack of confidence in the United States and that in such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that in recent years North Korea has been taking "significantly good will measures", for example, stopping nuclear missile testing, disassembling the nuclear test base and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"But we did not expect a similar response from the US," he lamented.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances the first unilaterally will not be armed in any way."
Before Rei heard complaints from North Korea about Washington’s phasing-out towards nuclear disarmament, according to which the North Koreans would be rewarded at the stages of its action, his statement was divided by the fact that he had not completely rejected the idea of bilateral disarmament as Pchenjan had done before.
Ri took note of the joint statement made by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Short during the first meeting of the US President and North Korean Leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to work on "the Korean side armaments", and he promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end of the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that Pchenjan must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to mitigate the severe international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US requires nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal by means of forced methods, even by refusing declarations on the end of the war," said Ri.
“To believe that sanctions can be passed on us is the same thing that people we don’t care about can do with utopian dreams.
But the problem is that the current sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim and Short Meeting, which was highlighted by the US leader in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings of the leader of Kim and South Korea, Moon Jae, in the last five months: "If another country were South Korea on this nuclear disarmament issue rather than the US, the issue of nuclear disarmament would not have been accepted by the Korean side."
However, Ri’s tone of speech changed dramatically compared to last year’s time when he told the UN General Assembly that when “Mr. Blogio’s President” short called Kima “Mr. rockets”, preparing a suicide mission, the direction of the North Korean missile to the United States was entirely inevitable.
This year in the United Nations Short, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, stood up for courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still much to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea meets the nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Short said that there was no time schedule for it, and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Chenjan for his actions.
However, on Thursday, Secretary of State of the United States Mike Pomeo told the UN Security Council that “the sanctions of the Security Council must be rigorously continued without any concessions until a complete nuclear disarmament confirmed by final evidence is carried out.”
The Security Council has approved with all its votes the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of the Pchenjan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeii met with Ri UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pchenjane next month to clear the ground for another meeting.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was a failure.
In July he left Pchenjan, saying that all progress had been made just so North Korea could declare after a few hours that he had submitted "gangsterical requirements".
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex during the meeting with Moon this month if the United States would take "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kimas said that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking are the security guarantees promised by the Short Promises in Singapore and will move towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all its students to sleep more in order to fight the growing culture of cats in studies, using caffeine and not sleeping at night
One scholar found that at the best university in the world, students often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Harvard Medical School of Sleep Medicine professor and Brigam Sičio, a specialist in women’s hospitals, prepared a course that, he says, is the first such type of U.S.
The inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the conversation, one girl came to me and said, "Why am I told about this only now, in the last year of the study?"
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me," he said.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results, to improve common sense.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Services Department Paul Barreira said that the university decided to offer this course when it became clear that the students had very little sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes an interactive series of tasks.
In one section there is a photo of the roommate's room where students can click coffee cup, snacks, coaches and books and learn about the effects of caffeine, light effects, lack of sleep impact on the results of sports and how important it is to go to sleep routine.
In the next section, participants learned how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the student city with interactive pictograms that encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
"We understand that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we think they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke," explained Professor Czeisler.
The culture of indigestion does not sleep overnight, he says, still exists. Modern technologies and increasing pressure on students have led to a growing lack of sleep problem.
"To ensure that he was sufficiently and qualitatively bedridden, there should be a secret weapon of students in combating stress, persecution and anxiety, he said, even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep changes the brain to hunger, so students always feel hungry."
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler prepare a course when last year, in his first year at Harvard, he attended one of his courses.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for the course available to the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all students of the second stage to listen to this course before starting to visit this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a benchmark when the time to go to sleep, as well as rising, and protect the harmful effect of blue light, which is spread by electronic devices and light diodes lighting, because they can eject your Circadian rhythm from balance, so it may be difficult to sleep.
"Livingston" 1:0 "Rangers": Men's ingestion of Gerard's men
"Rangers" experienced yet another disappointment when Dolly Mengai in Livingstone managed to overcome the depressed Steven Gerard's score of 1:0.
Ibrox expected to win his first victory in the run after the February triumph of 4:1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holto's team won Gerrard for the second time in 18 races and now the last team is already eight points away from the long-lost premier leaders of Hearts.
Menga broke in after seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, the Rangers did not see the possibility to balance the result.
"Rangers" now falls to sixth place, "Livingston" rises to third and leaves only one line from "Hibernian".
And Ranger's concern is not over, because it's probably a tribune butter thing that put on the head of the lateral judge Calumu Spencu and hurt him.
Gerrad made four changes that allowed Air to be rounded and led to the Betfred cup half-final.
On the other hand, Holt believed the same eleven that last week removed the point from Hearts, and he would have believed how his well-considered combinations strengthened the opponents in each step.
The Rangers were concerned with controlling the ball, but with it, Livingston did more.
They could have entered the second minute already, when Menga hit close to handing the ball to Allano McGregor to Scott Pittman, but the security took his chance by turning the ball away from the door.
After the far-off Kéaghan's free hit of Jacobs, Captain Craig Halkett reached, but his co-rapporteur, Alan Lithgow, asked for the country.
"Rangers" took control, but the last third of the competitions were only hope, not belief in their game.
After fifteen minutes, Alfred Morelos earned me a fine when he met Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson hired the Colombian complaints.
In the first row, Rangers managed to hit only twice, but ex-Ibrox's cousin Liam Kelly was hardly able to catch Lassana Coulibaly's blow head or mild breath of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34th-minute raid may not match the race, no one will dispute that they have earned it just for their efforts.
"Rangers" and failed again to overcome Jacob's false defense.
Scott Arfield was not upset when Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his name and handed it to Manga for easy completion.
During the break Gerard took action by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and that exchange almost immediately gave fruit when the country's security was playing Morelos, but after an impressive play after Kelly returned, he fired a blow.
"Livingston" included guests in a game that he liked – with the far-off transfers of the Lithgowo and Halkett ball.
At the end of the Holto team was able to increase their leverage, but McGregor defended Jacobs' impact after Lithgow's surrender from the corner.
After the change to the field, the Rangers player Glenn Middleton once again appealed for the penalty after meeting Jacobs, but Thomson and again he did not.
German: Geigeri numerator inventor
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years ago and a lot... That day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany.
Gegeris invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity. A invention that later created a device known as the Gegeriser calculator.
Since then, this device has become a hit in the science world, and later, a hit in popular culture, when in the 1950's film Bells of Coronado, scientists not particularly remembered Roy`us Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is the geigeri numerator used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on these ears, you can actually hear how atoms work, affect the radioactive effects in the minerals."
Evans: "Hey, now it really shoots!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that was given his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells and kill them
Vaccine has learned to recognise bad cells – this is part of the treatment
The method includes the release of immune cells from the patient and their replacement into the laboratory
Then cells can "see" proteins characterized by many forms of cancer and re-injected back
The test vaccine has produced many promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
For women treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, ovarian cancer has passed for more than 18 months.
The method includes the release of immune cells from the patient and the replacement of them into the laboratory, then cells can see proteins characterized by HER2 cancers and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Betesdo (Meriland) said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and immediate intestines," explained Professor Berzofsky.

Well, it's not over.
Following the unrelenting appearance of Sunday Night Live, viewers of the study insulted Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Short, and claimed to participate in the 2020 campaign.
On that evening, after performing the third song of Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the title "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the democrats and expressed support for the Short.
"How many times have I had to talk to white people, they said, "How can you like Short, because he's racist?"
Well, if racism were to worry me, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show started from the comic scene where Matt Damon laughed at Bretto Kavanaugh's Courts Committee on the wrong sexual behaviour of the accusations brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this has not been broadcast, the filmed material with West replicas has been uploaded to social networks by comics Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to experience West with this record.
In addition, West complained to the audience that the back of his head had discomforts.
"They're looking at me in the back.
He told me not to go in there with a hat like that.
They're looking for me!
They said I got the floor," he said, "Washington Examiner."
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is? ”
Start to love."
His statements at least twice led to an unconcerned rumors in the audience, and the members of the SNL broadcast appeared to be disillusioned, as Variety reports.
West was invited to change the singer Ariana Grande quickly because her former male rapist Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West swallowed up many with his performance, through which he performed the song "I Love it", dragging the costume of the Perrier bottle.
He received support from the conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who announced in the Twitter article: "To one of the bravest spirits: TO THE MINISTRY."
But the lead of the talk show in Karen Hunter's Twitter account published a record that West was just "was himself and it's amazing".
"But I choose the NEREMTI person (by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his "art"), whose convictions are a painful ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we're also free," she added.
Prior to the start of the show, the tweeter in the Twitter account announced that he had changed his name and that he is now formally known as Kanye West.
He wasn't the first creator to change his name, but he was on the same path as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleagues reperis Snoop Doggas was originally called Snoop Lion; the music legend Prince changed his name to symbol and later became known as Prince.

The Star of "Stop Wars" Another Harington criticises a distorted view of manhood
Another Harington boasted as a sword-fighting character in John Snow HBO's fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages "Stoat Wars".
But a 31-year-old actor criticises the stereotype of a cat’s monster, saying that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they should be tough enough to be respected.
Speaking "Sunday Times Culture", Another said that he thought "something is wrong", and raised the question of how to fight the problem of corruption in #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague named Rose Leslie, admitted that this topic “has a strong impact on him”.
“I feel that I am now deeply touched by this topic. Where did we make the mistake of cultivating manhood?” he asked.
"What do we teach growing men to cope with such problems?"
Another believes that the wave of this perverted manhood could be responsible for television because it creates very male characters.
He continued: “Who is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught on television or on the street that young people are convinced that they need to be men of that kind?
I think this is one of the important issues of our time – how do we change it?
It's obvious that young men and I made a mistake somewhere."
He also confirmed in the interview that he would not participate in any of the "Stop Wars" antihistoric or follow-up sessions when the next summer the series would end, and said that "he already had enough fighting fields and horses".
Since November, another film will be filmed in the modern version of Shepard's True West. It's a film about film directors and his brother's robbery.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him during the creation of the Sosty Wars – there he met his wife Rose.
"In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me the future family and the next life," he said.
The award of "Emmy" in the most profitable fantastic series Rose played Igritė, another character's object of love by John Snow.
The couple married June 2018 in the family owned by Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of disease 14%
China reports an increase of 14 % in citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 people were infected with the infection in the country.
A total of 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most newly infected people were sexually transmitted, and this is different from the statistics of the past.
Traditionally HIV infection in some parts of China is rapidly spreading due to infected blood clots.
However, this reduced the number of people infected with HIV almost to zero, reported by representatives of the Chinese health authorities during a conference in the province of Junano.
However, over time, HIV infection and the number of people living in China increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an obvious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was further decriminalised in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT persons is widespread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, between 70 and 90 % of men who have sexual relations with men eventually lead women.
Most cases of infection occur due to inappropriate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the workers have leaked data from the republican senator, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday Maxine Waters, the U.S. representative denied any suspicion that one of his employees had published personal information from three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia page of publishers of law.
Los Angeles Democrat believed that the accusations were made by ultra-right wing experts and websites.
"False, lie and again no lie," said Waters in his Twitter account.
It is reported that the disclosure also included the addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcho, both from Juta.
The information on the Internet appeared on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at the time the Senate was examining allegations of sexual misconduct against the High Court candidate Brett Kavanauhu.
The information gathered appeared as soon as these three senators asked questions to Kavanaugui.
"Conservatories' websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have been notified that the IP address, which identified the source of these entries related to the Waters Office, has been disclosed to a Waters member of staff", is reported from the Chapter.
"These unwarranted suspicions are completely false and absolute lies," continued Waters.
‘A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security has been affected by these fraudulent and uncertain suspicions is in no way responsible for the disappearance of this information.
These unwarranted suspicions are totally false and absolute lies."
The Waters statement was quickly criticised on the Internet as well as from the former White House representative for the press Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds bad," Fleischer wrote.
"It says that it does not have enough self-reliance to be a member of Congress.
If anyone is accused of things he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be defending.
He should not doubt the accused's motives.
It should be quiet and humble."
It seems that Fleischer tried to compare the Waters reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanauhu, who was accused of being too angry at the Thursday meeting.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who took part in the mid-term election campaign to change the Waters, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"The truth, if you don't lie," he wrote.
In its statement, Waters stated that its Office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the organizers are clear, it has continued, that they are legally responsible for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to all my staff without exception."
A review of the comedy "John English again" – a blown-up exhibition with Rowan Atkinson
The tradition has already become the focus of Brexit in any British film. It seems that the same can be said about the revitalization of the Francis of the Action Snips comedy "John English" – "John English" started to show again in 2003 and in 2011 returned to the screens with the comedy "John English Rise".
Will this sarcastic self-satisfaction about how we have clearly grasped become a new opportunity for national exports?
Whatever the case, the incompetent John English with wide eyes and rubber face has the second opportunity to bring up the unmistakable truth to the surface, although the very name itself clearly shows that this comedy work is intended for non-English cinematic regions.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, although having a claim to the advantage, acquired and a little bit of inspector Clouseau's properties, a little of Mr. Byno's characteristics and a sleigh of similarity to that guy, mentions what was used to create the theme of the drama "Fire Transport" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
It is also a little based on the person about the traveler and the mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV.
This latest film in John’s English has some beautiful moments.
I liked it when John England approached the helicopter, pulling a middle-aged suit and scarves, and the rotor of the brain came to his throat.
The comedy talent of Atkinson is obvious, but the humor itself seems to be infuriated and strangely over-excessive, especially when serious brands of film goods such as 007 and "Mission impossible", boldly insert the elements of comedy.
Humour is as if it were for children rather than for adults, and I don't believe that John England's adventures are as inventive and as clear as the silent jokes of Atkinson playing Mr. Byne.
At present, the most common theme is that Britain was in serious trouble.
The cybernetic hack successfully hacked into Britain's highly hidden network of webs and revealed the identity of all British webs in this area, causing the agent to be offended – the too insignificant role of Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop in the Prime Minister's cup, a poppastic and angled character, who is already suffering from a frenzy of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Teresa May expresses everything he can, but in the script, good materials for it.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents is revealed and that she will have to look for people among those who have retired.
This means that you will have to contact John English himself, a school director currently working in some law firm, but providing illegal lessons as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes when English offered a School of Rock snooping academy.
English is being sent back to Vitalo to discuss the unusual situation and there it agrees with its common Bough, which is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already married to a man who is involved in the command of the submarine, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays the high school girl, seems to be underutilized.
So Batman and Robin, who are capable of interfering with all things in His Majesty’s secret service, again takes action and meets with Olga Kurylenko playing a fatally beautiful Ophelija Bouletova.
A charismatic billionaire is in danger for the Prime Minister, saying he can solve the problem of British computers, that is, malicious Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odise: refurbished by the dealers, they set fire to the French restaurant, cause chaos in the luxury Volta yacht, and English starts a complete anarchy by trying to use the ears of virtual reality to get to know the interior of the Volta house.
All the stops were clear to keep this last series, but whatever it was pleasant or wild, all of this was a great memory of children’s television.
It's kind of medium-sized.
Like the other films in English, I couldn't get rid of the idea that a growing British film industry can't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
The Labour Party rejects a plan for British workers for four days a week but to be paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is planning to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but to pay for five days.
It is reported that the party wants company leaders to share savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution (DI) by providing their employees with one day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend and, at the same time, to pay the same amount at home.
The source says that this idea is in line with the Party's economic agenda and plans to direct the country's development towards workers in a positive direction.
The transition to four working days weeks was also welcomed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way to benefit workers from the benefits of the changing economy.
One of the high-ranking Leborist Party sources The Sunday Times said: "A review of the political provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the week of four working days is in line with the party's approach to economic balance for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall strategy of the party's industry."
The Labour Party is not the first party to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised a four-day general election campaign in 2017.
However, this idea is currently not supported by the entire Leborist party.
The representative of the Labour Party said: "The week of working days is not a party's policy and it is not discussed in the party."
The shadow government representative John McDonnellis used the opportunity to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economics of the Leborist Party last week.
Mr McDonelli said he was willing to recover power from "undeserved dictators" and "profit hunters" in municipal service companies.
Such plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their share, because the government of the leborists can take a look at the flight made.
It also approved plans to include employees in the company board and to create equity funds to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of private sector enterprises to employees and to receive up to GBP 500 annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the question "60 minutes" whether an FTB study on B. Kavanauho can change their opinion
In the FTB's investigation of the charges brought to Judge Brett Kavanaushi, a final vote was postponed at least one week or so before the Supreme Court, and the question arises whether the facts to be clarified by the Bureau of Investigation could affect the opinion of any senators of the Republicans in such a way that they would not accept this judge.
In an interview on Sunday in the ether, 60 minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it might be possible for the FTB to find out something that would change their opinion.
You see, Senator J. Kennedy is taking a more freer view than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, yes, of course," replied Mr. Kennedy.
“As I said when I was going to the meeting, I spoke to Judge B. Kavanaugh.
When this happened when the charges came up, I called him and asked, "Did you do that?"
He answered firmly, firmly, unequivocally."
Therefore, Mr Graham's opinion would not change anything.
"I have decided on Bretto Kavanaucho, which should be absolutely instigating," he says.
“Ford – I don’t know what was there, but I know one thing: Bretta’s categorically negative,” added Dr. Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘None of the names of the persons to whom it refers can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think something new will turn up."
What is the festival of the World’s citizens, and did it somehow contribute to poverty reduction?
This Saturday will be the World Citizens' Festival in New York – an annual music event that shows an impressive number of stars and that aims at the least impressive goal – to eliminate poverty in the world.
For the past seven years, the World Civilian Festival of the Central Park will meet tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to the stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawnas Mendes, but also spread the message about the real purpose of the event – to eliminate the particularly great poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012. This will continue the Global Fight against Poverty Project – an international mediation group that intends to eliminate poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, calling the phone, or somehow helping meaningfully to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, does the world’s citizens succeed in achieving this goal?
Is the idea of reparating people for a free concert really going to convince them to demand and invite them to act? Maybe this is just another example of so-called click, fictional activism, people think that you will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting on Twitter.
According to the World Citizens' Festival organizers, since 2011, the movement has registered more than 19 million of its supporters' actions, which promote the achievement of many of the various objectives.
They say that, under pressure from these actions, the world leaders have announced commitments of $37 billion and policy strategies to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group identified 390 commitments and statements that the Group's actions have already paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group, which is directly funded, has already affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among some key commitments can be mentioned "The Power of Nutrition" – a partnership between investors and performers operating in the United Kingdom, which aims to "help children to grow and reveal all their possibilities".In response to over 4,700 messages from the World Citizens, "Twitter" promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help solve the problem of malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments of countries and such as you, citizens of the world, we can achieve social injustices such as malnutrition become past," said Ambassador Tracey Ulllman to the concert in London in April 2018.
This group also indicated that after receiving 5,000 applications in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Mythological Power project, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs that asks, "Why do you think we can eliminate a particularly great poverty?",
The world’s citizens respond: “This is a long and difficult path — sometimes we are going through a fight and we are going through a lot of failures.
However, like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will be successful because we are all stronger together."
Janet Jackson, "The Weeknd", Shawnas Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the performers who are taking part in this year's New York event.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the United States can use the fleet to block Russian energy exports
"Dashington can use the fleet, if necessary, to prevent Russia's energy from reaching markets, as well as the Middle East markets," says US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zincke, as Washington Examiner.
Mr Zincke claims that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it acts as a legitimate authority's invitation, is a pretext used in the investigation of new energy markets.
"I think that Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," said R. Zincke.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do this by using the fleet, make sure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, can run the blockade, make sure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
R. Zincke said this to the participants at the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the U.S. "Energy Consumers' Voice".
He then compared Washington's methods with those which apply to the issues of Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially the same.
"Iran and Russia's economic alternative – to find a bigger or smaller balance to change the fuel," he said, and he also called Russia a country that the whole economy is dependent solely on fossil fuels.
These statements were made by Mr Short's Administration in his mission to increase the export of his liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia on the market, which offers European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
Therefore, the officials of the Administration of Short, including US President Donald Short, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the wrong Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Dr. Short, has become free of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion value of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will twice increase the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is just an economic project.
According to Kremlin, the cause of the close opposition of Washington to this project is only economic, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has seen a negative reaction from Germany, and it reaffirms its willingness to continue this project.
The main German industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), urged the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I certainly do not agree with the involvement of third countries in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemppas, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following the recent meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren says that he is seriously considering raising his candidacy during the 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he was seriously considering the issue of presidential candidacy after the mid-term election.
During the meeting, E. Warren confirmed the prospect of a candidate at the Holy See in Massachusetts.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to handle our failed authorities, they must also go to the highest position," she said in a rotouche.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether to take part in the presidential elections."
During the meeting at the town hall, E. Warren hired President Donald Short, saying he was leading the country in an inappropriate direction.
"I am very afraid of how Donald Short treats our democracy," she said.
Mr Warren openly criticises Mr Short and his proposed candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Mr Warren said that "an FTB study must certainly be carried out before voting".
However, the poll published on Thursday shows that most of the voters of the state themselves, E. Warren, do not believe that it should not run for presidents in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Political Research Centre of Saffolk University and Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The survey has shown that more support awaits former Governor Deval Patrick – 38 per cent support his candidacy and 48 per cent oppose.
Other names of representatives of the Democratic Party that emerged in 2020 were discussed by former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Mr Biden said he would take the official decision in January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin in the audience of Donald Short speaks of Track Palin’s post-traumatic disorder
At 26 years of age, Trackas Palin, who joined the military service in September, spent the year in Iraq.
On Monday night, after an incident of violence in the family, he was arrested and charged.
“I see what my son is experiencing when he returns to everyday life, so I understand the other families who are suffering from post-traumatic disorder and some of the injuries of our soldiers with whom he is returning”, she spoke to those who met at the Donald Shorte meeting in Tals, Oklahoma.
S. Palin called his arrest an elusive truth. She said that his son and other war veterans “returned a little bit, they returned with a stronger heart, they returned with doubt as to whether there would be respect for what their fellow soldiers and lacunas had done, and all the other soldiers had surrendered to their country”.
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, accused of domestic violence and assault against women, as well as accused of reporting domestic violence by having a gun and being indiscriminate, as Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasila Police Department, reports.
The 18 countries and the Colombian district support the opposition to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombia support the legal challenge of the new US policy refusing to provide shelter for victims of domestic violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of 18 states in Washington and this district submitted comments from friends of the curiae (judgment consultant) to support the challenge of asylum seekers' policy, NBC News reports.
The entire applicant's name in the Grace v Sessions trial, which the American Union of Civil Liberties launched against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says her partner "and his criminal gang members" raped her, but on 20 July US officials rejected her application for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawmakers from Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives many requests for asylum, such as countries, are experiencing problems of permanent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has repealed the 2014 Decision of the Immigration Appeals Council allowing non-documented immigrants fleeing from violence in the family to seek asylum.
On Friday, the Colombian District Attorney General Karl Racine stated that the new policy "is not amended by existing state, federal and international laws for decades".
"Federal laws require that decisions on asylum applications be taken in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and that this principle be infringed by such a prohibition," says a friend in the Curiae note.
In this remark, lawyers also say that the policy banning immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy, and that immigrants will be more likely to engage in business and "provide the necessary work services".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions pointed out in June that immigration judges would no longer provide asylum-seekers with victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their country of residence for persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or from a certain political point of view," said J. Sessions in a policy report of 11 June.
The asylum afforded was never intended to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face every day throughout the world.
Twice the number of victims of Paul is desperately sought out for the rest of the living
The situation of the rest of the living continues to deteriorate.
"The stress is very great," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, calming her baby's hot son in the city's evacuation center.
“The fast one does not stop carrying more and more bodies.
There's no clean water."
It has been observed that people return to their homes in ruins, collect heavy water supplies, and try to save as much as they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and 7.5-ball earthquake hospitals are inconvenient.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Haris, who have suffered back and fifth fractures, have been hospitalized in the field near the Palus military hospital, while hospital patients continue to be treated in the field for severe repeated beatings.
His eyes were filled with tears as he told of a terrible earthquake in the five - story - high room where his wife and daughter were staying.
"There was no time to save others.
I am shown to have stepped across the walls," said Harris “Associated Press” and added that he and his family had come to the city to attend weddings.
“I heard a woman’s cry for help, and then I kept silent.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're healthy."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of threatening advertising
A week ago, when the official Chinese newspaper distributed a four-page commercial in the United States, anticipating the mutual benefit of the US and Chinese trade, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of spreading the U.S. press.
On Wednesday, President Donald of the United States mentioned an annex to the most affordable newspaper Des Moines Register paid China Daily and accused China of affecting the elections of the United States Congress on 6 November. China denies such an accusation.
"D. Briefly accusing Beijing of trying to influence the US elections, marks the new strengthening phase of the Washington campaign aimed at putting pressure on China," said US officials to the Reuters agency.
Although it is customary for foreign governments to distribute advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a strengthening trade war, and both countries are charging for imports of each other.
According to experts from China and the USA, Chinese tariffs were applied to exporters from Iowa and similar countries who supported the Short Republican Party.
Terry Branstads, the US Ambassador to China, former Governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural production to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
On Sunday, in an article published in Des Moines Register, T. Branstads stated that China "is becoming more confident about printing promotional publications in the free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government used the respect for freedom of expression and press in America and ordered a paid advertisement "Des Moines Register," wrote T.Brandadas.
“In the meantime, you will not find each other’s voices in the local Beijing press, and you will not create a true picture reflecting the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the Chinese economic trajectory that is worrying, because the press is behind the firm support of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
Mr Branstad also added that "one of China's most famous newspapers has withdrawn from the proposal to print", but did not mention what it was.
Analysts warn: in the near Middle Elections, B. Kavanaugh failed the Republican voter
Although many Republican leaders remain loyal to the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, to whom even a few allegations of sexual harassment have been made, analysts warned that this would be a negative response during the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The situation is particularly strong, and many Republicans are already officially calling for a vote.
Such things can no longer be taken away," said Professor of the University of Syracuse of Maksvelo School Grants Reeheris to the paper "The Hill" published on Saturday.
Mr. Reeheris expressed doubts as to whether the last minute's call by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to launch an FTB investigation would be enough to discourage the bad voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it both tomorrow and November," according to the Washington newspaper, on Friday, the Chief Adviser of the Progressive View Group "MoveOn" and the National Representative Karine Jean-Pierre.
On Friday morning, protestors scandalized: "November is coming!" during the demonstration, the Senate foyer, when the Republicans controlling the Court Committee decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's demonstrations, kzip reported "Mic".
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be on the sidelines,” said news-based political analyst Stu Rothenberg.
– People say it was already strong, and they're right.
But it could still strengthen its position, especially among the undecided women's voters in the suburbs and among the 18-29-year-old voters, who, although not in favour of the President, often simply do not vote."
Even before Mr Ford publicly gave evidence, when she made a detailed statement of charges against the candidate by sexual attachment to the Supreme Court, analysts claimed that if the Republicans approve the candidacy, this could cause a humiliation.
"The Republican Party has caused a great deal of controversy," said former president of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"We are talking not only about the committee or the final vote, not only about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed a judge, but also about how the Republicans managed this situation and how they dealt with Ch. B. Ford," said Guy's Cecila, Director of the news channel, "Priority USA", who helps Democrats in the elections.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree as much as they would expect after the demonstrations by B. Kavanaugh and Ch. B. Ford, even though it has a little more support.
The new survey "YouGov" shows that 41 per cent would respond entirely or probably believe in Ch. B. Ford's evidence and 35 per cent would say absolutely or probably believe B. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent claimed that B. Kavanaugh really or probably lied in giving evidence, and only 30 per cent thought the same about Ch. B. Ford.
The FTB is currently investigating the allegations made by Ch. B. Ford and at least one of the other defendants – Deborah’s Ramirez – reported, The Guardian.
Mr Ford, who swore that he had given evidence to the Senate Court Committee last week, said that Mr. Kavanaugh had assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
Mr. Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed her her genitals at the evening she attended while studying at the University of Jeili on 9 December.
The newsperson plans to create a new web to oppose Google and Facebook
World Network Designer Timas Berners-Lee is creating a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor "Inrupt" is a company based on the Bernerso-Lee Open Code Platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information is available.
In an exceptional interview with "Fast Company" Berners-Lee, the goal of "Inrupt" was to manage the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the start.

The solid technology-based software enables people to create their own personal data store – POD.
It may include lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be available in a browser at the same time.
The internet store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides what and to which information can be accessed.
The company refers to this as a personal authorisation through data.
According to Director General John Bruce of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and the necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, IBM, a security platform purchased, a number of programmers hired to work with this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, global technology developers can develop their own decentralised programs using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not agree with Facebook or Google about changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In the Medium report published Saturday, Berners-Lee said that "Inrupt is a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the sustainability and quality of a new solid-based network."
In 1994, Bernersas-Lee transformed the Internet into Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the discussions on Internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Media Consortium, the Media Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel great optimism about this new web era," added Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Vannas – Priest awarded by the Victorian Cross in World War I
For the 100th anniversary of his birth in his hometown, he was the only Anglican priest, awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I.
Colonel Pastor Bernard Vannas won the award on 29 September 1918.
Sadly, after four days of shepherds shot the sniper, so he remained unaware that he had been awarded the highest rank in the British army.
At the time of the parade, in the Nortamptonshire graphics, the memory stone was unlocked by two annotates.
Michael Vannas, one of the authors of the book, said that the stone was opened just 100 years ago from the old, the award of a profitable craft was “beautifully symbolic”.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the St. Kent channel "by blowing a very smoke-exploited smoke, by striking the condition and automatic fires."
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and "especially gallantly" led the line ahead, and then one attacked the situation and killed three officers.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanná was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
At 72 years of age, Michael Vannas said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that would never be the same, but at the same time humility was a very inspiring thing.”
After the parade conducted by the imperial youth orchestra of Brentwood, Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vannas, helped to win.
Michael Vannas said that he had great respect for being part of the paradise and added: “The true steward shows the support that will be given to many people. ”
MMA astrologists did not sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to meet Kialyte Pepa
Imagine: You don't want to sleep all night to see the beautiful Bellator 206, but you can't finally see the main area.
San Choze’s exhibition was held on 13 March, of which six are on the main card and are broadcast directly in the United Kingdom all night long through Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, the film "Kiaulitė Pepa" was filmed by the viewers of the UK during the fight, with Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald.
Some spectators, mildly speaking, were not impressed because this was the reason why they did not sleep until the convention.
On Twitter, one patient called the change of the transmission to a child's animation film "a kind of sick pimp."
"In accordance with the rules laid down by the authorities, 6 a.m., such content was not appropriate and the children's programme had to be activated," said Chief Marketing and Communication Vice-President Dave's Schwartz, asked about the broadcast.
"Yes, "I've got Pepa."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust schedules in the light of UK observers.
"When I think about the repetition, I think we might be able to do that," Coker said.
“But then there is 6 o’clock in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to resolve it until Sunday in our time – Monday in their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Trust that when you change the broadcast, you've exchanged a lot of messages that weren't all friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it's a matter of government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give the astrologists more, but just failed.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Thomas Daley felt uneasy about his sexual orientation
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling less than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
24 a sportsman only said in primary school that he was not the same as everyone.
For the first time in the play "Desert Island Discs" in Radio 4 he said he began to talk publicly about the rights of the gems because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that after becoming a father it was not so important to win the Olympic Games.
The permanent director of this long-standing show Kirsty Young has for several months retired from work because of the disease.
In L. Laverne's first play, whose guests are asked to imagine that he is traveling to an uninhabited island, T. Daley claimed that growing up felt less than everyone else, because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said: “To this very day, the feeling of poverty and cytonism has been a source of encouragement to me by the forces that have helped me to succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove that it was worth not to disappoint the environment when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of two Olympic bronze medals became a high-level LGBT activist and took advantage of the opportunity to encourage more countries to decriminalise homosexuality this year.
He said he began to talk about it publicly, thinking that he had succeeded in being able to live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give others such a hope.
Three times the world champion said that he was not expected to fall in love with a man – the filmmaker Dustin Lance in the United States – who met him in 2013.
Mr. Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar laureate last year, but he says the age difference never caused any problems.
According to T. Delay, when he was so young to survive – at his first Olympics he was only 14, and after three years of cancer his father died – it's hard to agree with anyone of the same age, but experienced the same height and depth.
In June the couple became the parents of Robert Ray Blacko-Daley's son, T. Daley's perspective, according to him, changed completely.
“If you had asked last year, I would have said that it is important for me to win the gold medal,” he said.
– But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robis is my Olympic gold medal."
His son's name is similar to that of his grandfather Roberto, who died in 2011, when he was 40 years old, diagnosed with brain cancer.
And T. Daley, the father didn't want to agree with death, so one of his last questions was whether to buy tickets to the 2012 London Olympics that he was going to watch in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the first row,” said T. Daley.
“It was longer than his hands when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not invulnerable,” said T. Daley.
After a year, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympics and explored the bronze.
"I just knew that I had dreamed of it all my life -- dancing in water watching local spectators in the Olympics -- there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of the first song for the show – Heather Small’s creation “Proud”, which reflected his feelings as he prepared the Olympics and still pleasantly sharpened the skin.
"Desert Island Discs" is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. in the summer of Britain.
After the loss of the form, Ph. Mickelson passed the Saturday Ryder Cup Tournament on the ground
The American Phila Mickelson will finish the record on Sunday, as he will already participate 47 times in the Ryder Cup tournament, but in order not to make it a failure, he will need to improve the form very much.
Ph. Mickelson, the 12th time in a two-year race, was planted by Captain Jimas Furyk on the ground on Saturday.
Instead of being in the centre of action, as was often the case in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day in the maintenance team, and the rest improved his technique in the field in order to correct the obstacles to play.
Even at the height of the career, without a very direct hit, 48 athletes are not the ideal player in the steep "Le Gold National" squares, whose long blades of bitter grass are extremely unfavourable for targeted hits.
In addition, as if the field itself wasn't scary enough, the ninth cat that's going to run on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson is playing against the very exact British open tournament champion Francesco Molinari, who, along with the new Tommy Fleetwood, won all four cats this week.
If the remaining four points of the U.S. are able to successfully launch the approaching 12-unit match, Ph. Mickelson's match may become absolutely decisive.
Furyak expressed his confidence in his player, but he probably couldn't speak differently.
“He perfectly understood the role he played today, hugged me through my back and with his hand he said he was ready to play tomorrow,” Furykas said.
- He doesn't lack confidence.
He is on the list of the most famous athletes both in the past and this week very much gave to these teams.
Maybe I didn't think he was playing two cats.
I imagined more, but that's how it went, so we decided we'd do it.
He wants to play like everyone."
On Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the main athlete of Ryder's cup of cats.
This may mark the end of his Ryder cup career, as well as the heights of his personal records.
Ph. Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven levels, but Furykas claims that his presence has also brought unto the team intangible benefits.
“He’s a jolly, sarcastic, selfish, he likes to laugh at people and he’s a great guy with whom I’m happy to be in the team room,” he explained.
– I think that for younger players this week was also hard to deal with, it was good to look at it.
He brings much more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major breakthrough can quickly be predicted
Thomas Bjornas, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great change in approach to the latest Ryder Cup contests can easily grow into a difficult fight.
The Danish athlete debuted in May 1997 in Valderamo, where the team of opponents led by Captain Seve's Ballesteros had five points in force against the Americans, but only crossed the finish line just as soon as the result was 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"We still remember that we had a great balance in Valderamo; we had a great balance in Brooklyn, where we lost, as well as in Valderamo, where we won, but only a little," said T. Bjornas (in the photo), having observed the victory of the game in 2018 at 5:3 Friday and 10:6 at the Le Golf National Square.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow's gonna take all the strength.
Go and do everything the right way.
Until there are no points in the board, the game is not finished.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we need to pursue it consistently.
I always said, I trust those 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the appearance of his players in a complicated area, T. Bjorn said: “I would never want to escape behind my eyes in any way.
Tomorrow's gonna be a whole different hair thing.
Tomorrow will be the most important individual game – this is everything else.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's okay, but when you're alone in the field, you're being tested for your ability to play golf.
This idea needs to be installed for players – tomorrow you will have to print everything out.
Now he will have to separate with his partner, and he will have to print everything out."
Unlike T. Bjornas, opponent Jim Furykas hopes that his players will look better individually than partners, except Jordan Spythe and Justin Thomas, who gathered after three points of the four.
Furyak himself experienced both sides of the last day's surprise because he was on the winning team in Brooklyn until Europe performed the Medina miracle and turned them into losers."
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, asked as Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 motivated his players to get on the last day.
– Tomorrow we have 12 important cats, but you are looking for a quick start – what you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When speed occurs in one direction, the middle cats become very tense.
We have formed our team accordingly and we have released the players in a way that we, you know... we are trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Mr. Thomas will have to try to fight and compete with Rory McIlroy at the highest level, and among Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonas Rahms, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I have chosen these men in this order, because I think they will successfully win the whole game," said T. Bjornas about their choice for unit races.
Delivery of the new German military ship rescheduled
The latest Fragata of the German military fleet had to start work in 2014 and replace the cold wartime military ships, but, according to the local press, they will not be seen at least until next year because of all emerging systems and particularly high prices.
According to the military representative quoted by Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new Baden-Viurtemberg cargo ship, the delay in operation has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship had to join the military ship in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project covered the problems that the ship has already faced.
Four Badeno-Viurtemberg-class ships ordered by the military fleet in 2007 will replace the Fragata of the Bremen-class.
They are believed to have a powerful position, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft rockets, and a certain secretive technology such as a reduction in radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Another important feature is the longer periods of supervision, which could allow the most recent frigates to travel far from home ports even to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, military vessels of the most advanced technology of the late years, which are reported to have allowed Germany to direct military power to the overseas territories, will pass until they are used.
The failed F125 frigate came to the headlines last year when the German military fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the building of Blohm & Voss ships in Hamburg.
This is the first time a military ship returns the ship already delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is not known, but the German press reduces a number of essential software and technical equipment defects that would have caused no one to believe in the military mission.
The lack of software is particularly important, since the Baden-Viurtemberg class will manage about 120 mariners' crews, which is half the capacity of the Brennan class.
In addition, it has been shown that this ship is too difficult – it reduces its efficiency and restricts the ability of the military ship to implement various improvements in the future.
It is believed that 7 000 tonnes of Rhineland-Palatinate are twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project – including the training of the team – is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from the initial amount of €2.2 billion to the startling shock of $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The most recent problems of the frigate have become particularly significant after recent warnings that the German military fleet is failing.
Earlier this year, the German Parliament's Committee on Defence, Hans-Peter Bartels, acknowledged that the military vessel is actually "in need of proper use of ships".
The officer said that over a period of time, problems had arisen because the old ships had already been written down, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Viurtemberg class frigates were able to join the military fleet.
"National Trust" listens to the life of the secret bastards
A new study carried out in one of Scotland’s High Courts aims to reveal how peanuts are used in land-based hunting.
It is expected that the breeders will provide new knowledge of the behaviour of unique flying mammals and will provide some guidance for future nature conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland researchers will observe in their research the ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ost water ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich ostrich est in the gardens of Vester Rosa Inverev.
Special recorders will be placed at certain locations of the territory allowing for the monitoring of the activity of bats throughout the season.
National Health Service staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys by hand detectors.
An analysis of all sound recordings will be carried out by experts to determine the frequency and activity of the low-voltage signals and of one or more types of activity.
A map and a report of living areas will then be created to help form a detailed picture of behaviour across the landscape.
The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) Natural Protection Advisor Rob Dewars hopes that the results will reveal which residential areas are the most important for rodents and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat conservation, such as the creation of pastures, as well as how best to monitor forest areas in order to be suitable for turtles and other relevant species.
Over the past century, the population of the Scythians has declined in Scotland and the whole United Kingdom.
They are threatened with building and real estate development, affecting the periphery and destroying residential areas.
There is also a threat of wind power and lightning, as well as mosquitoes, some chemical tools used to treat building materials, as well as hunting house cats.
The bastards aren't really blind.
However, to catch a grave during the nighttime hunting helps the ears more than the eyes.
The location of the obstacles on the road between the torso or flight shall be precisely determined by an accurate echo location.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is particularly responsible for the cyclists.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out the investigations, checks on the periphery and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even created the first and only reserve specifically for puppies in Scotland in Damfris and the Threeave in Galvey, where eight of the ten species of puppies live.
The court overseer David Thompson says that the court area is ideal for them.
“There’s a great place in the door for the bastards,” he said.
– We have old buildings, lots of soft trees and beautiful areas to live in.
But we don't know much about the bastards yet, so work here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need in order to succeed."
He emphasises that it is essential to check whether there are no rodents before the start of the territory's surveillance work, as the accidental destruction of one periphery may kill up to 400 women and young people, which may result in the destruction of the entire local population.
The wolves are protected and are prohibited from killing, harassing or disrupting them, as well as from destroying their feathers.
Scotland’s welfare officer Elisabeth Ferrell invited the public to contribute to the rescue of the victims.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our son-in-laws, and we don’t know how many local populations succeed.”
Ch. Ronaldo rejected the allegations of exploitation – lawyers intend to file a German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo called the charges he made by using "melagins" and said that people, using his name, "try to boast".
His lawyers prepared the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which printed the charges, to bring them to court.
The attacker of the front of the Portuguese and Juventus clubs is accused of using American Kathryn Mayorg in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he then allegedly paid 375 000 dollars to women to slow down the event.
Speaking on behalf of 142 million live followers in Instagram a few hours after reports of charges, Mr. Ronaldo criticised them for 33 years and called them "melagines".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today – liars – was five times the Ballon d’Or winner looking at the camera.
– They want to make a name for me.
It's normal.
They want to be loud, saying my name is part of my work.
I'm a happy man, it's all right," – smiling added the athlete.
According to Reuters, Mr. Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to refer Der Spiegel to the court for allegations they have called "an unacceptable suspicion of private space matters."
Judge Christian Schertzas said that the athlete would seek compensation for “moral damage which would correspond to the significance of this violation – good, one of the most serious violations of human rights in the past few years.”
It is claimed that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the casino and hotel apartments of Palms in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted by Nevada Clarke to the District Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the sportsman’s room after meeting at the nightclub, in which he allegedly seized it in an analytic way.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo attacked the road and told her that he was a "99 percent good person", which he gave the remaining "one percent" to his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had sexual relations but claimed that they had been contractual.
Mr Mayorga also said that she had turned to the police, and her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed not to agree in court, because "fearful actions" and did not support the "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she still feels traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was a Beperien from Manchester United to the Madrid Real Club, and this summer, when he signed a 100 million-euro value contract, he joined the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit. The United Kingdom would regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
According to the Secretary of Business, Greg Clarke, the United Kingdom would "permanently have mercy" if Brexito lost the world's leading car manufacturing position.
He added that he was concerned about the statement by the Toyota department in the United Kingdom to the BBC that, after Britain withdraws from the EU without an agreement, production in Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily stopped.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the break-up at the border occurred to Brexit without the loss of jobs meant by the agreement.
Last year, the Toyota factory, Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars, 90 % of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly left the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production," said Toyota, Director General of Burnaston Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW claims to close its Mini plant after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, there are no major threats to Brexit’s supply chain without a contract.
The Toyota production line shall operate whenever necessary because the details of the cars produced under the order are delivered from both the UK and the EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, the EU leaves the EU without a contract, there may be disturbances at the border, says industry, it may be delayed to provide details or to lack them.
Toyota claimed that the Derbyshire plant could not contain more than one day of stocks and production would stop.
According to Clark, the future relationship with the EU's Theresa May 'Checkers' plan is 'prepared precisely to avoid such checks at the border'.
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract that, as I say, would allow us not only to enjoy success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
Not only toyota, but also other car manufacturers' data indicate that it is necessary to continue to use a highly successful supply chain system."
Toyota was unable to say what time production would be stopped, but warned that in view of the long-term perspective, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
For 24 years, Peter Tsouvallaris, who works at the Burnaston plant and at the United Nations trade union meetings, said that his trade union members are increasingly concerned: “I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never return.”
The representative of the government said: "We have proposed the objectives and credibility of future relations with the EU plan."
According to the White House, a brief meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
"Continuing the fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court judges, a very important meeting of Donald Short with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week," the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller – the latter investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the short-term assistants' relations with Russia and the possible impediment to the President's justice.
The question whether the Deputy Attorney General will be released in a short time, thus endangering the independence of Mueller, has been running for months in Washington.
This month's New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the transfer of microphones to short conversations and the possibility of removing the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
However, when he died of reports of resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United States of America, would take place on Thursday.
A brief statement was made that he did not want to forgive Rosenstein. Later, the meeting was postponed so that he would not agree with the meeting of the Senate Courts Committee in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford were witnesses, one of the women accused of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, the FTB ordered a week to investigate the allegations made by Kavanaugh and then postponed the vote at the Senate plenary meeting.
The short representative for the press, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “Its date is not set; it can take place this week, but all events related to the Supreme Court may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see, I always like to tell the press."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: since September 10, Sanders has not held any White House press conference.
Head Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the press conference rarely takes place because it doesn't like TV journalists seeking effects for viewers. True, he added: "I have to agree with the fact that they are looking for effects for viewers."
Then he noticed that Shorter with the press was more common directly.
"The President answers questions more often than any previous President," she said, and, without giving any evidence, she added, "We have reviewed these statistics."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this and you have seen that this has been done many times in recent weeks. Press conferences will change your direct contact with the President of the United States."
A brief answer to questions is given by leaving the White House, by attending public meetings or press conferences with honored guests.
One person's press conferences are rare.
The free and sometimes strange appearance of the president before journalists this week in New York must have explained why.
Minister of Health for Scotland's NST staff from the EU wrote about Brexit's concerns
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to the staff of the Scottish NST from the EU expressing the country's gratitude and desire for their stay after Brexit.
The Scottish MP sent a letter to Jeane Freeman less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
In a letter by Mr Freeman, he said: “In the summer, the UN and the EU negotiations on withdrawal continued and are approaching the forthcoming decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government has begun to prepare a faster and possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very upset now.
That is why I wanted to repeat how I appreciate the contribution of all workers – whatever their nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care system to the benefit of our dependent patients and communities.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Abercrombie emergency surgery for a head trauma
Saturday through the result 31:27 “Vanderbilt Commodores” team lost the head trauma of the race to the defender “Tennessee State Tigers” to Christian Abercrombie, an urgent operation, reported journalist “Tennessean”.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and just smacked there," said Reed.
Coaches and doctors at the Abercrombie sideline gave air to the oxygen, then laid on the bones and sent for further tests.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of Neschville (Tenesis) told WSMV that the Abercrombie operation at the Vanderbilto Medical Center had been completed.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type and extent of the trauma", while Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie has officially passed the sports season from Illinois and the tennis State team plays the first season.
Before leaving the matches, he recovered five balls on Saturday, and the total number of balls he recovered during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers who purchase real estate in the UK will have to pay a higher tax
According to new tortoise plans, the UK real estate buyers will have to pay a higher mark fee and the additional money received will be used to help those who are not
This step will reduce the risk of a successful Corbyno campaign for young voters
Taxable persons in the UK will be taxed by an adult mark
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to raise up to 120 million pounds a year and allocate them to help the homeless
Today Theresa May will announce that UK real estate buyers are planning to tax a higher rate of tax and additional money received to help the homeless
In order to ensure more affordable housing and to apply to high-income people, it is believed that this step will reduce the risk posed by the successful campaign of Jeremy Corbyna for young voters.
The increased tax will be taxed on non-taxable persons and businesses in the UK, while the additional money received will be allocated to the Government’s campaign to promote the free movement.
The additional charge — payable next to the current trade mark tax, including two years ago for second houses or rents that had been bought at higher rates — may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this step will raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London’s newly built real estate is purchased by non-UK residents, making it more difficult for first-house buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many rich countries and especially capital regions have become city leaders.
The new strategy was presented just a few weeks ago, when Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax and thus helped more young people to acquire their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying land, but without using it, of maintaining high prices of real estate, and called on May to resolve the shame of British housing by refusing the purchaseable household allowances.
Corbynas has published several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the ban on discharge without guilt.
He also wants more power to build new homes for municipal councils.
“ In the past year, ” said May, “I said that I would be able to return to the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
This means that we need to set up a damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it is wrong for non-US residents and foreign-based companies to buy houses as easily as those working hard in the UK.
The dream of many people having a home has become almost unreal, and the threat of humiliation is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish elections"
The leader of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his final goal is ever to become the head of the Scottish election.
The 42-year-old scotch likes the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, currently in the third place of the first league and three points remaining from the first place club.
Last season, St Mirren returned to the Scottish Championship, and this summer he moved to the Stadium of Light.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I went to the B, and that's what it's all about," Ross told the BBC program "Scotland's Sportsound".
“But as a child, I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my father watching a lot of Scottish election competitions, and this always drew me back.
True, this opportunity will only take place if I manage the club successfully."
Iki Rosso "Sunderland" led Dickas Advocatas, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neillas, Roy ́us Keane, Gus Poyetas and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals, said he was not worried about starting to work for such famous leaders in such a big club.
"Now my success will be assessed by the answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
According to the structure and conditions, this club certainly belongs to the Premier leagues," he said.
"Then it's not an easy task to take him back, but I'm probably just going back to the club, and I think I've been working here successfully."
Rosso's leadership career lasts only three years. Before that, he worked as a director at the Dumbarton Club and changed the Hearts coach for 15 months.
He later helped to restore to the third division of Alloa, and St Mirren's club, which was threatened to fall, turned the next season into the winners of the championship.
Rossa says that he is now more satisfied than ever in his career as a player in clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"This change must have been radical," he recalls the leadership of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that it was better to lead me – better than to play.
That sounds strange because I followed, I made a lot of money, and I was happy.
But playing can be hard.
There are many problems that need to be overcome every week.
And now it's not easy – working stress and stress, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it. When I was an adult, I always felt in my prayers, but leadership brings the greatest satisfaction."

Studies have found that the best time to drink beer is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer’s heat wave increased the income of poor British bees, but increased the burden of restaurant networks.
The figures revealed that the sales of beads and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent, but income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA, who prepared this data, said: “The unending solar eclipse and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Championship showed that July continued to be a similar trend as in June, with an increase of 2.8 per cent. Indeed, restaurants were more affected than ever.
In June, trade in restaurants decreased by 1.8 per cent, and the July situation worsened.
The main results of the beer and bar sales were undoubtedly the best, and the trade in them grew stronger than the decline in restaurants.
Although not as strong as the restaurant companies, the sunflower also affected the main income from the food supply chain.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sale of beverages in well-restrained beads and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month and the sale of food fell by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM’s analysis of the leisure and fertility sector, says: “These results continue to be a visible trend since the end of April.
With regard to food establishments, the main factors continue to be the impact of the air and the main social and sporting events.
So it is no wonder that the groups of restaurants are still poor. Indeed, the fall in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful because it will contribute to unrelenting cost-related pressure.
Most food-trading companies were unable to arrive in the worst summer. Time will show whether a milder August feels the temperature will provide the necessary rest."
The overall growth in sales in bells and restaurants, including newly opened sites, was 2.7 per cent and reflected a slowdown in the development of networks belonging to trademarks.
A monitoring tool for sales of the UK beads, bars and restaurants is recognised as The Coffer Peach Tracker, which collects and analyzes operational data from 47 active groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One of the five children has social media accounts hidden from parents
The study revealed that one of the five children – some at the age of 11 – has social media accounts hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that more would be faked by Insta pages
The news boosted the fear that sexual content would be published
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents the main account
One of the five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, is a secret social media account and hides them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the faked Insta pages are rapidly increasing – this is a reference to the Instagram photo sharing website.
The news boosted the fear that sexual content would be published
Twenty percent of students claimed to use a censored main account to show their parents, but also have hidden accounts.
One mother accidentally found out that a secret daughter of a 13 - year - old girl was forced to say, “Excuse me. ”
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors Conference (MDK) found that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 have two accounts, and half of those students have recognized the account as hiding.
Mike Buchanan, head of the MDK, said: “The fact that so many young people are trying to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them is worrying."
Eilidha Doyle will vote for athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected as a consultant at the annual meeting of the Scottish Board of Sports Management.
Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of various international experience they have gained over the past decade.
"Eilidha earned great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world sports community, and we have no doubt that her inclusion in the Council will be of great benefit to Scotland's sport," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to serve as a voice of athletes and I hope that I will really contribute and help to run the sport in Scotland.”
A 200-400-metre match in the 1996 Atlantic Games and a total of four Olympic gold medals won by the American, now a permanent BBC expert, was unable to walk after a short-term ischaemic attack.
"Twitter" he wrote, "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show me whether or not to what extent I would be successful.
Work had to be done before the persecution, but I was completely welcome, I learned to walk again, and today I practice mobility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast-feeding advertising, which compared mothers to cows, received different evaluations on the Internet
The company producing breast milk received different opinions on its advertising, which compared feeding mothers to boiled cows.
In order to mark the beginning of the trade of the product described as the first silent, portable breast appearance in the world, the company Elvie has launched an advertising inspired by the ironic music video. It is aimed at demonstrating the freedom granted to nursing mothers by the new coin.
The four true mothers dance in this full cowhouse according to the sound recording, for example, the words: "Yes, I love myself, but I can't see any tails" and "If you haven't noticed, here are no tribes, here are my breasts."
The appendix continues: “Take it out, take it out, feed it, take it out, and bring it out.
However, an advertisement published on the Facebook page caused an online dispute.
The viewers responded differently to a video that was reviewed 77,000 times and that received several hundred comments. Many claimed that it was looking through the fingers at the horrors of the milk industry.
"It is a very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, only after their newborns are taken from them a few days later," wrote one woman.
Elvie breast arm is incredibly space in the feeding basket ("Elvie" / "Mother")
Another observed: “It is understood that it hurts both the mother and the newborn.
But why don't you take advantage of their advertising to deliver breast milk to mothers whose babies are not taken from?"
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding.”
Another commenter's advertisement was defended, one woman admitted that her song appeared "very serious".
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy it if I still had food.
When I quit my milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little stupid, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant", wrote one.
Another comment: “This severe advertising is intended for mothers who break up their milk (usually in jobs or in toilets) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to drink or condemn the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that all dances with unobstructed fists.
The idea of the campaign is based on the perception that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's coin does not spread any sound, has no wires or tubes, and incredibly space in the feeding basket, so women can move freely, keep the babies or even leave the house by stopping the milk.
Mother partner and executive director Ana Balarin commented: Elvie's coin is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative start to trade it.
Compared with milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the withdrawal of milk and to all its challenges, and to the extent possible by showing an incredible sense of freedom that will be provided with new coins.
Elvie's pendant entered the press headlines for the first time.
During the London fashion week, the designer Martos Jakubowski’s collection of two children’s mothers on the podium demonstrated using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp near the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border during the month has not significantly changed, but the number of children detained migrants has increased considerably, partly because of the strict rhetoric and policies of the Short Administration has made it harder to accommodate them with guards.
Traditionally, the majority of the guardians themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid that applying for child care risked being able to stay in the country.
After announced to the Federal Government in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families will have to provide fingerprints and these data will be shared with immigration authorities, the risk has increased.
Last week, the Chief of Immigration and Customs Service, Matthew Albence, attested to Congress that the institution had detained a number of ten people who applied for care for adult minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Almost 80 percent of these persons – the guardians or their family members – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
That's why we're going to continue to persecute these people," Albence said.
According to caregivers, in order to consider children's cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month of detention, not within 60 days, as usual.
Many of the requests for legal status against a lawyer on immigration issues will try to defend, not in person, but through a conference video call.
Those who do not have the right to receive the aid will soon be deported.
According to the reports received by healthcare workers and in recent months from the system, the longer children stay, the more likely they will be to become restless or depressed, which may lead to forced passage or attempt to escape.
Defenders claim that this is even more worrying in large institutions such as Tornillo’s shelter: because of its size, it increases the likelihood of not noticeable signs of a child’s fainting.
They added that moving children to the tent without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma that many have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In addition, referring to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Validas al-Mualemas has invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war has been taking place in the country for eight years.
Moualem, also acting as Vice-President of the Prime Minister, said that foreign forces engaged in anti-terrorism activities in Syria's land are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to leave their homes, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said that Damascus would not be able to fight this holy war until we destroy both terrorist groups and any illegal foreigners in all Syrian territories.
There are approximately 2,000 United States soldiers in Syria who mainly train and consult Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land wars in the war-stricken country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Maualems said that the conditions for their return were good. At the same time, he accused some Western countries of spreading unjustified fear that turned the refugees away.
"We went to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will receive recovery aid only when the Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
The UN diplomats state that the recently concluded agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress in Idlibe has created conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has helped to avoid a massive attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces, directed towards a province in which three million people live.
However, Moualemas stressed that the terms of the agreement were clear, and he expressed the hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including combatants from the Nusra front with Al-Qaeda, who would be destroyed.
The UN envoy, Staffana de Mistura, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of the Committee of Government and Opposition to prepare a draft Syrian naval constitution and prepare for the elections.
Maualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian Government will take part in the committee – the work of the group must be limited to the review of the current articles of the Constitution and not to interfere.
Why will Short be chosen for the second term of office?
On the basis of such logic, in 2020, the Short would be elected unless, as many liberal observers may expect, its presidency would have ended in time.
Without a doubt, this would be the most dramatic ever when the end of the presidency was!
Until now, the eyes are tired of seeing signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the best broadcasting time on CNN television has increased more than twice to 1.05 million and MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million best broadcasting time viewers, with an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show takes the lead in cable television rankings with even 3.5 million viewers on the main news evenings.
"It's a fire that attracts people because we don't understand something," says Nealas Baeris, producing the ABC series "Descedent" about the secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers, who becomes president of the attack that broke out after the House of Congress.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian writer and author of "Only parts of happiness and some unpleasant truths as secret access to the Hollywood Children's Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said I'd vote for Short.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'He's kidding me,' said Scovell.
Chaos are worth a break.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the sets emerging from Washington can decide the Roe before Wade's future, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the world economy.
Ignorance is the advantage that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it is more than necessary to be informed by a citizen, when you realize that for six hours now you are seeing a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward uses unpublished data in his book "Bamme", Paul Manafort demonstrates a $15,000-dollar-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-skin-spinning", wrote The Washington Post, and what a shocking description of the Stormy Daniels Short Anatomy.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario again.
"Its actions remind us of the reality of the show, because every evening it throws something at you," says the Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, Brentas Montgomery.

When I contacted Fleiss this week, in the field near his house on the north coast of Kaui there were 27 degrees of heat and light sun, but he was still inside and, recording CNN, watched MSNBC.
He could not unravel – certainly not when Brett Kavanaushi had to stand before the Senate Court Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on his hair.
"I remember when we created those foolish shows, people said, 'This is the beginning of Western civilization,' said Fleiss.
"I thought there was some sort of postage, but it turns out they were right."

In the tense mid-term elections to the House of Representatives, money comes from the environment
It is no wonder that the reform of the congressional districts, which ended with the two members of the House of Representatives trying to win the same position, has brought the 17th district of Pennsylvania into line with the money.
The recently relocated suburban Pittsberg district included Democratic Member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamba – last spring he won his place during the special elections in another district.
Lambs competes with another member of the House of Representatives – Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania. Most of it prevails with a new 17th.
The maps were revised when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the violation of the Constitution had been falsified for the benefit of the Republicans.
During the election campaign in the new 17th district, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DRC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC) – were grouped on the funding of the campaign.
Lambs boasted in Pennsylvania when a small vote in the 18th Congressional district won the wide-ranging special elections held in March.
The Republicans took this place for more than ten years, and President Donald Shorts won 20 points in the district.
The political leaders have given the Democrats such an advantage.
The United States considered Salvador to be punished for supporting China, but then swallowed
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, but have not in fact seen any negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Short attended a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in the country until the partners broke up with the management of "Trump Organization".
"The officials of the Department of the State of Taiwan decided to withdraw the Heads of Diplomatic Representations of the United States from Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for the recent decisions to withdraw from recognition," said Heather Neuert in a previous report published this month.
However, sanctions are being considered only for Salvador who received US$ 140 million in 2017 aid from America, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions covering the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions on specific persons would have been painful for the Central American country with a high level of unemployment and homicide.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which had to take place after a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials of the administration clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to take place and thus essentially ended any discussions on the sanctions against Salvador.
"In order to show how important the administration is for this meeting, the list of speakers for the conference planned to be held in mid-October is included by Vice-President Mike’s Pence," the diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to Salvador, Panama, and Dominican Republic without reporting any persecution or punishment in Washington.
The representative of the White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion that three American officials, including two diplomats, had told Bolton. They agreed to discuss internal discussions only if their anonymity is preserved.
Their statements are confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, also speaking if its anonymity is preserved.

The Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on the possible short-term distortion of justice can therefore be expected to be unavoidably seen – its very strong evidence is now available in the public archives.
In addition, as it has been said, Mueller is asking whether Russia is not secretly involved in the short campaign in cooperation with our elections.
If Congress were to move to other hands, Shorty would have to assume responsibility in this institution at the same time as he is preparing to stand again before the voters, or perhaps finally before the governors' commission.
There is a lot of 'if' here, and I do not say that the short end is inevitable – as it is in Europe.
We will have to choose between the two sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938 the German officials were ready to take Hitler away – it was necessary for the West to oppose him and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.

History revolves around such essential points of momentum – then the unwarranted march of democracy is accelerated or suspended.
Now the Americans are at several such essential points of momentum.
What will we do if the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, is released by a person whose fate depends on the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein's disturbances began when this newspaper reported that last year the official had proposed secretly to register the president and had considered his incompatibility with these duties.
Rosenstein says the "Times" story is not accurate.
“How will we react if the new FTB study conducted by Bretto Kavanaugh appears to be incomplete or incorrect or if, despite credible allegations of sexual violence and false evidence, this candidate will be appointed to the Supreme Court?
And finally, will we vote in the middle elections for Congress, which will force the Short to assume responsibility?
If we do not support these tests, democracy is at risk in the long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep them.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, and she was taken to Osvençim by the same Nazi regime that once lived in houses where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years sent me to light a candle on a table with a sponge.
When I have such a legacy, how can I look to our future unoptimistic?"

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers meeting with Rapid Vienna awaits optimistically
On Thursday, Rangers Rapid Vienna will accept the fact that if the impressive competitions with Villallarreal that took place in Spain earlier this month against the Austrians could take place in a strong position allowing the G group to leave.
Due to the middle of the trauma, the player Graham Dorrans could only appear this season for the first time in a match with Villallarreal with the result 2:2. But he hopes that the “Rangers” club can use this result as a trampline towards more important goals.
"We had a good result because "Villarreal" is a great team," said the 31st player.
“We began to play with the hope that we would achieve something, and we ended this achievement.
At the end of the day, we may have been able to be more peaceful, but in general, the competition was not bad.
They must have been better at playing the first one, and we sat in the second and showed who we were the better team.
Thursday will be another important European league evening.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be hard because in the past matches their result was great. But I have no doubt that with the support of the viewers we can push forward and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what happened to my traumas, and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the boys are really happy; training is great.
I hope that we can now push forward, forget the last season and play successfully."
A woman who suffers from fear of retirement suffers from insomnia
Although the interviewers had a clear idea of what kind of care they would like to take, few had talked to family members about it.
About half of the respondents in the Nationalwide survey claimed that they were talking to their spouses about the price of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said you were talking to your children about it.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but they are not trying to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Company.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not report your wishes in advance, you will not be prepared to take care of your family.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where you would like to receive any care, as these factors may be important for the purpose of providing for expenses.
Call the financial advisor, and the advisor can also help to figure out how to pay for these expenses.
You may decide to pay these expenses by means of a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a cash life insurance certificate or by insurance your property until you have the money.
Select legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by saving legal documents.
Choose a health care authority. Assign a reliable person to take care of your medical care and ensure that your wishes are met if you are unable to communicate.
Think, too, about the authority to take care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that the accounts are paid if you become ineffective.
Don’t forget the details. Imagine that your elderly parent or mother needs urgent medical attention and carries him or her to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
To prepare, write down these details in the plan.
"Not only financial issues. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

Ilfrakum Pneumatic Shooter Several times
After spending the night in the city, the man who went home was shot several times by a gun.
For 40 years, he was stabbed in the chest, abdomen, and arm in the Ilfrakum Oxford Grauvo district, Devon.
About 02.30 p.m., the officers described the shooting carried out in the summer of England as accidental conduct.
The victim's been attacked.
The injuries are not a threat to his life, and the police are asking for help from the Witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
"At least 384 died when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the city of Palu on Friday," officials say.
As a result of the destruction of the communications services, the authorities were unable to obtain any data from the Dongal Regentity – in the north of Pala, near the 7,5-point earthquake epicenter.
In the face of disaster, more than 16,000 people are evacuated from the city.
Here are some of the most important facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Slaves.
In 2017, about 379 800 inhabitants held Palu are the capital of the Central Province of Slavesio, established on the west coast of the island of Slavesio.
When the earthquake struck and the tsunami struck, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regentity that runs beyond 300 km (180 miles) of the coast of the island of Slaves in the north west.
In 2017, around 299 200 people lived outside the province of the smaller administrative region.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Celebration, particularly in the coastal region of Dongal.
It is also important in the province that nickel mining is, in fact, mainly concentrated on the other side of the Slavic coast in Moroval.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered several times in the last century from tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, in 1996, Dongal was hit by tsunamis and killed by nine people.
On a seismicly active Pacific fire, the existing Indonesia is constantly rocking the ground.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a severe earthquake in the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceho in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed over 226 000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of them in Acehe.
At the end of March and early April 2005, a number of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Near the island of Nias, hundreds of people died.
In 2006, the 6,8-point earthquake struck the southernmost populated part of the Indonesian island of Java and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6-point earthquake struck the area near the capital of the western province of Sumatra, Padango.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, a 7.5-point earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentavaja in the province of Sumatra and caused a tsunami with a wave of up to 10 meters, a washed ten villages and a dead of about 300 people.
In 2016, because of the severe earthquake in Acehe, Pidije Jaja's regentia was devastated and panicked, as people recalled how everything was devastated after the terrible earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
In 2018, strong earthquakes struck the island of Lombok, which was visited by tourists from Indonesia, and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily landed on the shore.
Chief Sarah Palin's son is detained for family violence
As a result of the accusations, Trackas Palin was arrested, the son of former Governor of Alaska and the candidate for Vice-Presidents of Sarahos Palin.
The report published on Saturday by the Alaska Police states that 29-year-old Palina from Vasila (Aliaska) was arrested for suspected family violence, an obstacle to reporting domestic violence and detention.
As stated in the police report, when he tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he removed the phone from her.
As KTUU reported, Palina returned to the pre-trial detention facility in Mat-Su and was released for $500 security.
"Today he appeared in a court where he was asked to justify his claim to be completely innocent," the network reported.
The fuel is charged with three Class A offenses, which means that a fine of up to one year may be imposed and punished by 250 000 U.S. dollars.
He's also charged with a Class B violation, a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected attack.
The file is currently being examined by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
This event is linked to the allegations made to him by an attack at home in January 2016, an obstacle to reporting the crime of domestic violence and the maintenance of arms in the event of a blackout.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from the veterinary groups when her son’s harsh behavior was associated with a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died after Friday in a tsunami that hit the island of Slaves, Indonesia.
7.5 The earthquake caused a tsunami, and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communications networks are not working, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake took place near the central Celebration, north-east of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
The social media shares video footage showing the moment of the tsunami.
The tsunami struck the coast when hundreds of people were gathered at the beach in the city of Paul.
Federal Prosecutors for the Suspect of a New York terrorist attack aim at the rare death penalty
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking a death penalty for Sayfill Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. This is a rare penalty that has not been committed in this country for federal crimes since 1953.
On October 31st, Saipova was suspected to have taken off the home depot and set up an attack on the bikes along the western highway of the Land of Manhattan – driving on the road, laying the pedestrians and the bikers.
As stated in the South New York report on the intention to pursue the death penalty, prosecutors justified the sentence will have to prove that Saipova deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges may incur the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court of Appeal issued to Saipov a finding of 22 counts of charges involving the killing of eight counts relating to the use of assets (usually in cases of organised crime by federal prosecutors) and the execution of charges of violence and motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claim that the attack was well planned and planned in advance, and this is what Saipova named it as a riot, a riot, and a moral one.
"The action of Sayfull Habibullaevicius Saipov was damaged, damaged and lost by the following family members and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernán Diego Mendozo and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucci", says the report on intentions.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case involving the death penalty was examined in the South New York District ten years ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last sentence of death was executed in 1953 in the New York federal case for Julius and Etheli Rosenberg, when they were sentenced two years ago to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to the court documents, Saipova, who came from Uzbekistan, did not repent of his conduct either immediately after the attack or several months later.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
On the basis of the indictment, Saipova revealed to the officials that he was inspired by the videos of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he was watching on his phone.
The police reported that they had also requested that the flag of the Islamic State be suspended in the hospital.
He did not acknowledge his guilt on 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defenders of the federal state funded by Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty, not to acknowledge the guilt and jail the living head without being able to be released, will only prolong the trauma of these events to all related persons," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to be sentenced to death.
The third parliamentary speaker said that Mr Farague should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Turkish conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation’s army.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must feel Eurosceptics hot, and one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Community Chamber of Demonstrators in Birmingham, said that the UK would have already survived if Brexit had been Farage's secretary.
But the difficulties that May is facing in trying to unite the scattered allies with the rest of the country have been revealed by the EU-speaking parties who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement the compromise plan agreed in the Czech Republic when it is attacked by Brexit's supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies urged that it strive to reach an agreement with Brussels despite adverse reactions and to force the Eurosceptics and the Leborist Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone, through the "Leave Means Leave" myth, Solihale said he wanted to destroy the Chekers plan.
He claimed that Farage should have been an equivalent partner and that he should have been responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already left the EU," he said.
Member of the Welingbor Parliament added: 'I am fighting for Brexit, but we must reject the Chekers plan.'
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We fought in World Wars not to be obedient to others.
In our country we want to adopt our laws."
"Bone's denial that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
Brexit's novelist Andrea Jenkyn also took part in the demonstrations and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Mr. President, listen to people.
The Chekers' plan is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not popular among our party members and activists who go to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up the Chekers plan and start listening."
In the critical report, May added: “The prime ministers will keep their posts when they keep their promises.”
Farage said that feeding policies must be forced to feel hot if they are to issue a decision adopted by the referendum in 2016.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us, the people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to issue Brexit, so today we're here to tell them that we won't let it go when we do it."
Turning to the enthusiastic minority, he added: "I want you to force our political class, which almost gave Brexit up, to feel hot.
We are mobilising this nation's army, which has brought us the Brexit victory, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud in the United Kingdom."
And Brexit's opponents walked through the streets of Birmingham two hours before establishing a mythical city center.
After the group set up this weekend, a team of activists will act on my own posters "Torias v. Brexit".
Leborist Lord Adonis seized the conservator on the security problems they experienced as a result of the party program at the beginning of the conference.
"These people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for Canada plus," he said, "for borders without borders and free trade without borders with Ireland."
"This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take serious consideration of participation in the presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections.
Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in a meeting with society, which took place on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who constantly criticises President Donald Trump, participates in the November re-elections in which he meets GOP’s representative, Geoffu Diehl, one of the leaders of the short campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been suggested that it can compete with the Short 2020.
From the time that Short became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjoke was 36 meetings with voters using the format of the public meeting with the public.
One participant asked whether she planned to take part in the presidential elections.
Warren replied that the time had come for women to go to Washington and reform the failed government, and that they must lead the woman.
Suspected LSU in Sims removal case
The Baton Ruž police in Louisiana reported on Saturday that they had detained the suspect, accused of shooting LSU basketball player in Wayde Sims on Friday.
At the press conference at 11 a.m., the Baton Ruž police department reported that Ditheon Simpson had been detained for twenty years.
The police distributed a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man who saw it.
Twenty - year - old Sims was shot and died near the University of the South before Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday that Wayne Sims had been shot in the head and died of injuries.
Wayde stood up to defend a friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having a crime scene, had a gun, and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was deemed not to have opposed and was arrested in the arrest of the police department of the Eastern Baton Rose.
198 cm of the previous course, Simsas grew up in Baton Rose, played 32 races last season, 10 of which started in five, on average spent 17.4 minutes in the field, earned 5.6 points and recovered after 2.9 balls.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world champion when the team instructed him to give the victory to Sebastian Vetteli
When Valter Bottas won Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear immediately that the instructions of the Mercedes team in the competitions would be very important.
The race started in the first place, and Bottas started well and, defending his position in the first two directions, just left Hamilton in trouble, encouraging Vettel to attack his team's friend.
The first one turned to the two open garage, left Hamilton, and went to the races in the back of the band, so it was crucial.
Mercedes turned to the two open garage after the wheel and returned to the road behind the Vettel, but Hamilton, after having just finished contact, turned to the front when the Ferrari driver, after a double manoeuvre, reluctantly released the internal side of the road in order to preserve the position in the third direction.
The 21st birthday celebration of Max Vertappen started at the end of the drive, but at the end of the first wheel, there were already seven.
He was the fastest part of the race because he was going without changing the tires to be as fast as possible in the finish line as Kimi Raikkonen and finish the fourth.
Finally, in 44 wheels he turned into two open garages, but on the remaining eight wheels he was unable to increase the pace and the finish line was completed by a quarter.
“Valter had a hard day because he was doing well all weekend, and when I was asked to pass, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team worked well and searched for the first two," Hamilton said.
It was a really simple body language.
President Donald briefed Senator Diana Feinstein during a meeting with people on Saturday because this rebel has denied a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which a candidate for the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh is accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking in West Virginia, the President did not directly name Ford's evidence to the Senate Legal Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are dishonest, unfair and unfair.
"What could have happened and actually happened in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people being angry, angry, unfair and unfair," he said.
“When you see official statements and omissions, and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you run away?
Do you remember her answer to the question, “Oh, what?
Not really.
I'm not running away."
Well, wait a minute.
If we're gone... no, we're not gone," he added, viewing the senator.
Another July Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford’s accusations against Kavanauhu and which had been dropped earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letters had been dropped from her office.
On the basis of The Hill, Feinstein said to the Committee: "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations and her stories did not go away."
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the negative president apparently did not agree with her, and he said during a meeting with the people on Saturday evening: “You know, it was really a bad language.
It may not have happened, but it was the worst language I've ever seen in my body."
Further defending the candidate to the Supreme Court judges, who were accused of three women by illegal sexual conduct, the president said that the democrats had used accusations for their own benefit.
‘They shall endeavour to restore power by any means necessary.
You see greed, dishonesty; they don't care about what they hurt or what they have to go through to get power and control," another president's "Mediaite".
Elite League: “Dundee Stars” 5:3 “Belfast Giants”
Patrick Dwyeris won two prizes in the match with Dandi club Giants
"Dundee Stars" won the victory of the victory in the Elite League on Friday and won the "Giants" Saturday's responsible match at Dandi's score 5:3.
The "Giantas" first broke out when Patrick Dwyeris and Francis Beauviliers won two sets of awards.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were a balanced result before Dwyer took "Giantas" back to the front.
Francoi Bouchard of the Dandi team compared the result, but later two Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's troops won the victory.
Adam Keefe’s men suffered a third defeat this season in the elite league, before Friday night in Belfast and won the Dandi Club as a result of 2:1.
This was the fourth team meeting this season, the three previous cats won the Giants.
Two of the first intruders entered the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendello McFaullo's transfer, and after four more minutes, Beauvilier doubled his sentence after David Rutherford's transfer.
In the hard-started competitions, Sullivan returned the owners of the arena to the game by winning the 13:10, and after Matt Marquard's transfer, Cownie took off the result 15:16.
Two made sure that Giants would leave for the first break in the first instance, and at the end of the first one, he earned his second set of evenings.
Having a quantitative balance, the landowners regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced the result 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran united their forces to help Nielsen for the first time in the competitions to push the Dandi team forward at the end of the second hill, and established the victory by winning the fifth team in the middle of the last hill.
"Giantas", who have already lost four last matches in five, will meet Milton Keynes' team next Friday at home.
The pilot was killed to help hundreds of aircraft passengers escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was announced by a superintendent when he was killed by an aircraft with several hundred passengers safely lifted to the air.
More than 800 people were fished, and the majority were considered to be the deadliest earthquake that caused the tsunami that struck the island on Friday.
The site continues to be hit by strong reciprocating underground strikes and by many people in the ruins of the city of Palus.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21st-century Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a heavily fluctuating control box at the airport of Mutiaras Sis Al-Jufri in Palu.
He remained at his place of work to help the 6321 aircraft that had to fly the Batik Air, which was already on its way up, safely to take off.
Then, when he thought the flight control tower was crashing, he jumped out of it.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to Australia's ABC News, Indonesia's air navigation representative, Johannes Sirats, said his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We sent him to a higher hospital in the next town from Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, after the helicopter didn't reach Paul.
"We have no knowledge of this pain in the end," he added.
And the government is afraid that the number of deaths can increase to thousands, because the country's disaster reduction agency reports that the cities of heaven, Sigio and Boutongo are difficult to reach.
"The number of victims is expected to increase, as many victims are still under the ravages and we cannot reach them," said Sotopo Purwo Nugroho, representative of the agency.
To the height of the wave of six meters, the city of Palu was destroyed, and on the Sabbath of the great court was laid.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
At 35 years of age, the mother of Risa Kusuma Sky News said: "Every minute, fast cars bring the victims.
There's no clean water.
All over-exploited private stores .'
Janis Gelfanda, director of the International Red Cross of Indonesia, CNN, said: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help its survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
It is already a tragedy, but the situation can get worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, James Widodas, came to Pala and asked the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says that when the plane falls into the canal, one person is missing
The flight that ended the plane crash in the Pacific Ocean basin of Micronesia, now operating, says that one man is missing, although earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from the flying plane.
In the report, Air Niugini said that on Saturday afternoon they did not know about one passenger man.
The airlines indicated that they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals, and researchers in their search for a man.
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local ships helped rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane was trying to land at the airport of Chuck Island and landed in the water.
On Friday, the officers reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, all of them stable.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what was the exact sequence of events.
The Airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed in a bay without getting down like that.
Some Witnesses of the event felt that the plane had not been able to land on a landing like this.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from very low.
"That was very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others had been able to get off the plane before the crash.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and he himself experienced a slight head trauma.
The U.S. Navy reported that by repairing nearby trailers, their mariners also helped to rescue people who were blown off by boat to the coast before the plane crashed into a depth of about 30 meters.
According to aviation safety network data, 111 people died in aircraft accidents in Papua New Guinea during the last two decades, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst laid out the sequence of events at night when a woman was burned alive
The Prosecutor’s Office presented the facts available on Saturday in the case of a man who was accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowletts testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the mobile phone records to connect the 29th-century accused Quinton Tellis and nineteen-year-old victims of Jessica Chambers' death at night.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowletts said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber on the evening of her death, which contradicted previous statements.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that that day was not in his city.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had told the truth saying that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "failing because his trucks were in Nashvil."
Another dissatisfaction was that Tellis claimed to have known the Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records show that they met each other during the week.
Rowletts said that after some time after Chambers died, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls and address information from his phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
Defence is expected to begin on Sunday with its final arguments.
The judge told me that the case would be handed over to the oathers later that same day.
"The High Breed": what is the conscious hippopus?
The Hippopo Trie wants to change the negative view of this genre by spreading their music to positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hippopas is far from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to go back to the hippop resource and re-populate the conscious hippop.
These performers such as The Fugees and Common recently reborn the UK in the works of performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York's kid handed a couple to the court after being fired from work for a "racist" message
The New Yorker's grandson handed a couple to the court for dismissal from work on grounds of discrimination after receiving a message sent to the wrong address from the mother complaining that she was "one more black".
The couple are negative to existing racists and the claim is called "consuming".
Two children’s mother, Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, was surprised to learn that the new guardian of the children Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on the first working day of 2016.
“NOEEEEEEEEE, AND ONE DIFFERENT” – Mr Plasco-Faxman wrote to his husband in a message.
However, she was sent not to her husband twice but to Mr. Maurice.
On the basis of the New York Post, the understanding of the impetuous conduct of Plasco-Faxman felt uncomfortable and fired from work by Mr. Maurice, saying that the former African-American child had done his job badly and expected to be replaced by the Filipinos.
Mr. Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent home by Uber's car.
Maurice has now given a couple to the court requesting compensation for dismissal and is seeking to adjust even after 350 USD per day for half a year's life and work at the client's home, to which she was initially hired without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things cannot be done," she said on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
The couple turned away from the accusations of racism by refusing to forgive Maurice for her work because they were afraid that they could not trust her after she was offended.
“My wife sent her what she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plascas' husband.
“Would you trust your children, someone you were unmanned, even though that was a mistake?
Your newborn?
They don't."
According to the claim, Plascas said that his wife had been pregnant just two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation".
Are you going to judge that?
This is not very nice behavior," added an investment banking specialist.
While the case was being handled, the media quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticising their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Padington’s publishers are afraid that readers will not understand a talking forest
The daughter of Bondo Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel in another place reading the book for the first time before it was released.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about Padington's enormous success."
In saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before discovering the inspiration to write a book on a peach for children, would not have been too angry if his work had been rejected, and added that the 60th edition of the book was pleasant and sad year after the father’s death.
Speaking of Padington, which she describes as "a very important family member", she added that her father was quietly proud of his success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and didn’t like to drink,” she said.
“Because Padington was so similar to himself, he felt as if he had a child who had achieved something: you are proud of him, though it is not your job.
I think he had a similar appreciation for Padington's success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruits of his imagination, he always gave the merit to Padington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone with her.
After her daughter was released, she was rushed to Nicos Louis Pasteur’s 2 hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"The House has always called and said that the situation is really bad, it is not expected that it will survive," said Dr. Ednan-Laperouse.
“I then received a call from Nado, who was calling to say that she had stayed for two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her: “Tashi, dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicinal products that have maintained the growth of her heart have slowly ceased to function and have been removed from the body.
She died a little while earlier, and it was the end of everything.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't fight, laugh or cry because I was in the environment, surrounded by families and people.
I should've kept it in me."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperous, now to disappoint his dead daughter, entered the plane together with other passengers, not realizing what a difficult trial she had to face.
"Nothing knew," she said.
“My head was thrown away and tears were poured out all the time.
It's hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt a great pity for Nadu.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
In the open of vulnerable women, the aim is to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones in death try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Vels Bridge spread opens with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and ask for help.
Mr. David's son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed and killed when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want one parent to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
While living in a refugee camp, 45 - year - old Davis said that her son was a very promising boss, who gave up a contagious smile.
“He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit the room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was “in a very dark place”.
In 2014, a brother named Tyler, who was 11, found his murdered brother.
Mr. Davis said, "I am afraid a chain reaction can occur."
“ That people know that there are people around us who can be contacted and talked to, even if they are friends, ” said Mr.
Don't sit still, you have to talk."
Mr. Humphrey, a longtime friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15 - year - old partner, Mark, who left his life shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was feeling depressed, involved in depression and didn’t complain,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we have seen his attitude changed.
During Christmas the situation was completely bad: when the children realized their gift, he did not look them in the eye and did not respond at all."
She said that his death was a major injury to them, but they had to overcome it: “In the family it left a void.
It dries our hearts.
However, we must all live on and fight on."

After FTB started the study, the future of Bretto Kavanaugh stuck on his hair
I thought that if we could actually get something he asked for – a limited study of the length and scope – perhaps some unity in the contribution," Mr Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would be in the strong support of the allies.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters not want the FTB to start the investigation?
Their opposition is only a matter of time.
Until the mid-term elections, which will take place on 6 November, only five weeks remain and, if the Republicans are expected to appear poor, their efforts to elect people to the highest court of the country will be very weak.
George W. Bush called on the senators to try to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and met his wife Ashley, former personal secretary, Mr. Bush.
What will happen when the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh Senate may obtain 50 votes to allow Vice-President Mike Pence to terminate the relationship and approve it to the Supreme Court.
When Kim came to power, the number of North Korean deserters was "reduced"
The publisher of the laws of South Korea said that the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea had decreased when Kim Jong-uns came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seugas, quoting data from the Ministry of the Union of South Korea, said that 1,127 deserters were identified last year compared to 2,706 deserts in 2011.
Mr Park said that the main factors were increased control of the North Korean and Chinese border and increased human smuggling prices.
Pchenjan did not comment in public.
Many North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border.
Many fled across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often makes them return to their homeland.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still technically fighting, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pchenjane in negotiations, in which negotiations on nuclear weapons had been closed.
This happened after the June meeting of President Donald Trumpo and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where both agreed in essence to achieve that the Korean side would become a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not changing their sanctions.
"If there is no US confidence, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not, in any way, be the first unilaterally armed," said Mr Ri, speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Brett Kavanaugh renders "sterical" and claims that he does not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the House of Representatives' Minority Nancy Pelosi called the candidate of the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "sterical" and said that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court for his temperament.
Mr. Pelos made these remarks during an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I simply cannot believe that if a woman did so, she would be said to be a wife," – Mrs Pelos said her reaction to the testimony given on Thursday to the Senate Court Committee.
Mr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
In his introductory speech, when he spoke about the family and the high school times, Mr. Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes uninvited or uninvited.
He also condemned the former democrats in the committee, who made accusations against him, calling him "a messy and coordinated destruction of reputation", which was not organised by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelois claimed that Mr Kavanaugh had demonstrated that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his side-by-side view of the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself by his statements and by the attack of the Clinton and Democratic Party," she said.
It was asked whether it would be possible to remove Mr Kavanaugh, if his candidacy was approved and the majority of the votes received in the House of Representatives were democratic, Mr Pelos objected.
“I will say so – if he is lying to Congress or to the FTB, it is not only proper to go to the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he is currently working,” said N. Pelosi.
At present, Mr Kavanaugh is the judge of the Colombian District Court of Appeal.
Ms Pelos added that she was concerned about possible decisions by Mr Kavanaugh as a Democrat regarding the Access to Health Law or the Roe v Wade case, because he was considered a conservative judge.
At the approval meetings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be withdrawn.
"Now is not the time for us to become a judge in the irony, lateral personality, saying, 'How wonderful!'," said Mr. Pelos.
The potential for women to use
This is a legitimate criticism, which has finally been exhausted for months and even for a year, and which it cannot express without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," after 45 years I was told by the Steinem panel.
"I don't think it's an unusual thing, do you?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by one woman, the manager of a company, who said that she was crying when she was upset, but she developed a certain method: she was upset and started to cry, and she told the man with whom you were talking: ‘ You may feel sorry for me because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And she just went on.
I thought it was a genius."
The tears are considered to be an acceptable expression of anger in part because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my greatest memories is from one of the first works in the office, where most of the men worked and where I started to cry for unspoken anger, and then I was picked up by an older woman, the north manager, who was always a bit attached to me, and he pushed me into the closet.
“Never let them see you crying,” he told me.
- They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, so you'll be happy to win."
A member of the Democratic Party Congress from Colorado, Patricia Schroeder, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a foreign ship called Monkey Business (aforism, which means an easy-to-use time), and he withdrew his candidacy, Mr. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he could not apply for the president himself.
“It wasn’t a good idea,” he said, laughing after 30 years.
– There were already seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another one.
Someone called me "Snow with seven noodles."
Later, after the campaign was started, there was little time left for the funds to be collected, and she vowed to nominate her candidacy until she found $2 million.
It was an unequal fight.
She noted that some of the sponsors who offered $1,000 to men had only spent 250.
"Did they think I was getting a discount?" she said.
In saying the language in which the campaign was launched, it was so filled with emotions – people with gratitude, a system of disappointment, which made it very difficult to collect funds and directly reach voters, not representatives, and anger over sexism, that it said so.
“You should remember that I was nervous,” recalled Mr. Schroeder’s press response to her language.
– You'd think I'd be supported by the Kleinex server business.
I remember thinking what's going to be written in my tomb.
"He's gone?"
How the U.S. and Chinese trade generation can benefit Beijing
The U.S. and Chinese War of First Salvation has been built, and although the fight has not yet ended well, according to experts, the dispute can become useful for Beijing for the long term.
US President Donald Short gave this year's first warning of previously taxed main products exported by China, including solar elements, steel and aluminium.
The most obvious opposition occurred this week when new tariffs were in force affecting goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), i.e. half of the goods exported to the United States will be taxed.
The Beijing response to all the measures was the same, with the most recent decision based on the five to ten per cent duty on American goods with a total value of 60 billion dollars.
China has sworn to fight U.S. teeth for a tooth, and it seems that this second by the size of the world market is not really going to go down in the near future.
Washington's sanctions would only be mitigated if China complied with the demands, but the US would publicly be too secure for Chinese President Xi Jinpingui.
However, experts say that if Beijing has properly damaged its party, the difficulties of the US trade war can have a long-term positive impact on China because it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The fact that an early political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the economy of both countries is, in fact, much more dangerous than the observers have so far acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, an employee of the scientific institute "Asia in the New American Security Centre".
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the country is ready to accept returnees
Syria states that it is prepared to return voluntarily to the refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of the war-torn country for more than 7 years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Validas al-Mualemas said conditions in the country are improving.
"The progress in combating terrorism has made the situation in the territory much more stable and secure," he said.
The government is continuing its efforts to restore the damaged areas of terrorists and restore the normal situation.
All conditions have already been laid down for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions directed against daily life and prosperity.
UN estimates have left Syria some 5.5 million cheeses since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Humanitarian aid is needed for six million people still living in the country.
Al-Mualems claimed that the Syrian regime would welcome the aid for the reconstruction of the country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from the parties supporting the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, with the final result of the U.S. team 16,5:10,5, won the Ryder Cup in 2018 at the Le Golf National Square near Paris (France).
The U.S. has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time and has not won the Ryder Cup in this land since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team gathered 14.5 points enough to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phila Mikkelson, who was hard to follow during the whole tournament, launched a hit from the starting site directly into the water. He was shot on the third day of the 16th match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari looked all rounds and became one of the four players who achieved the result 5-0-0 since 1979 when the tournament gained the current form.
American Jordan Spithe 5:4 won the lowest ranking European team player Thorbjornas Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson 2:1, who holds the highest ranking in the world, lost the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last "Ryder" cup tournament.
The eight Ryder Cup Tournament veteran Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in this tournament ever, gathering 25.5 career points.
"I often cry, but I cannot manage today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I am very happy, very happy to have returned the cup.
Everything depends on the team, and I am glad that I was able to help," said Garcia, who was talking about emotions after the victory of the Europeans.
He transmits the falcon to his great-grandfather John Ramu, who in the Sunday unit game 2:1 swallowed the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods.
"I was incredibly proud of the victory of Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play," said Rahmas for 23 years.
Woods lost all four of his cats in France and now belongs to him 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who won the 14 greatest prizes and only gave to Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team failed to access the drive yard all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
“ I’m proud of these guys, they’re fighting, ” said Captain Jim Fury.
This morning was a moment when we started printing Europeans.
We're walking.
I'm taking the liver to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Stock Exchange Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to lower our head.
Our opponents were superior."
