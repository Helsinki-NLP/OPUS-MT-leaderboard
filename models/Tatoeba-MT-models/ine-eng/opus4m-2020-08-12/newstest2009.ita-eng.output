The Prague Stock Exchange at the end of the market has had a negative crash.
After the collapse of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transactions in CEZ operations have reached almost half of the daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange recovered from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this bottom is the collapse of the shares on Wall Street.
So, too, we show a reaction from the market to the outcome of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan for stabilization of the local financial sector.
Breakdown of shares in Asia
Tuesday, the actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indexes, however, later cancelled some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong during the day cancelled almost 4%, but then also part of the losses stabilized at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese shares at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has fallen by 3.8% while the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares in the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but at the end the losses were assisted by 4.3%.
The Thai-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, has decreased by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world," noted the head of the Hong Kong Currency Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being a member of China, manages its own financial policy, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return quickly to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is the risk that other countries may also have consequences.
U.S. Action strips
On Monday, the US Parliament rejected the financial system support plan, for which $700 billion (almost twelve billion Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
The legislators thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
The American actions on Monday lived a row, and the main indices of the actions recorded the biggest collapse since more than twenty-one.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a collapse of similar size was last observed in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the draft law had not been approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has given up: the US government can extend $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
US legislators have broken the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the US financial system for a total of $700 million (almost twelve billion).
But it's not said yet.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define certain details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, he told the agency Reuters, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee of the Barney Frank room.
According to some sources, the Senate could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor in the awakening of financial markets.
Then, however, we will have the return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, we will reach market aid.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We have taken a great step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the package for market stabilisation," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met at night between Saturday and Sunday with the US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give final shape to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-cashable mortgage assets from financial companies, leading financial companies to serious losses and endangering the stability of the entire system.
"We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and must also be effective on the market."
"It's necessary to bring the recovery plan further forward, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is strongly affecting the markets for the stocks that are rapidly rolling.
According to the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement at the Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm down investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in a timely manner, the first to influence the market on Monday following the Congress decision.
But for now it is not absolutely clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if the negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problems.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount planned for support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the remaining appropriations in the event that the program does not carry out its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350 end.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may vote on this decision, the Congress may vote against his right to vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program remained, i.e. to obtain the funds to buy the passive mortgage values, whose price is broken by hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've developed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law of Sunday and the Senate Monday," the Republican senator mentioned.
Progress in the negotiations is also met with US President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Frato said Bush is satisfied with the positive progress of Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachutes
The chairman of the bank committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the closure of the budget for reductions, the fractionation of the financial plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called "golden parachutes" for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee to monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have taken a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan depends on the help of the owners of the houses who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new rates of mortgages that it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly rates for debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Mark: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this because we don't know how and for what price the problem assets will be bought
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will share losses," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
If the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, it is already this week that Congress representatives find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it before possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this most important moment," Marek stressed.
Duel to the latest blood: MP3 players against cell phones
We'll recommend how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It is clear from this that it is best to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why you should seek an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the use and needs of the future owner.
You may find it difficult to buy a high-quality expensive swirling to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these music products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this reason there is no objective reason either.
However, if on your sheds vinyl hard-rock, jazz or blues probably vinyls are filling up, a kind of giraffe at least you dream of it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8 thousand crowns for a reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly digest the crowns from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes, including enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is to be decided.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply read the music, but they don't even make the cell phones wrong.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
Besides the primary functions, calling and sending text messages, you can read music and videos, record both and have a camera, sometimes better at times worse and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle that no refrigerator can do the grill and no TV can take pictures of anything.
The universality of the cell also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on your cell phone and first the display indicator will require the battery.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cells can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, musical players (especially those that are simpler) are much more effective.
As far as economic mobiles are concerned, there is no contact that can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, try to work for safety another battery, that's also true for the most expensive devices.
But you will not have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charge.
Another problem arises when you download the music in the cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of devices have the USB universal port and not all of them can connect to the computer without a special software.
Certainly music can be recorded directly on memory card, but only few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
The readers, except for some exceptions (Ipod) don't need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from the computer.
Most cell phones and readers are created by themselves a multimedia library ordered by the name of the interpreters, album name, gender or by the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you are especially interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly ease of use.
If the music is especially useful to you from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you need a cell phone that reads MP3.
This is now possible, clearly at any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about what the cell phone or the reader recognizes.
MP3 players support all of them, the overall majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common, the total majority of the devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best cell phones also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album through the mobile internet.
This same service could already be a valid topic for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited only to hit at the moment of the radio.
Prices aren't really very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (either through GSM ,internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone back.
Anyone wants to hear some fruit in the bag while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on this, whether you always carry the headphones or at least the earphone without wire.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 players has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very decent walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entry for the common cupboards.
The best and most technically equipped cell phones, including 3.5 mm take for the common cupboards, cost up to 15 thousand kroner.
Instead, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, the easy handling.
The simpler ones don't necessarily cheaper (see our choice) make it really anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling at a time with the common stereo or perhaps the rotating, is obvious.
There is no risk of misusing the launch of the mobile Internet network and as a result of a huge data transmission bulletin.
What device to take
Even the cheapest cells (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, which is included in the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones also do it with 8 GB memory card.
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy also a low cost MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are part of the most demanding listeners you prefer to take the specialized cell phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service is thus close to the same MP3 player.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more roads, which walkman mobiles have the same scale as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 readers of the above mentioned brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in a maximum line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is mature enough and our operators offer virtually all the services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing – a virtual operator that forces traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe has already been written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the accounts, ČTU also confirmed it, which made it clear that the price of SMS is higher than that of the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming tariffs, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks the competition that would really want to start the fight.
Perhaps it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage high above 100%.
On the other hand, mobile telephony operators like to feel that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense he often emphasizes also the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTU), Pavel Dvořák, who in the past once said that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with its network is not likely to have many possibilities anymore. (The rest may be difficult to find now other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a significant decline in prices, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time even before the entry of quali like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, there were voices like us in Britain.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can really succeed.
At the end of the accounts for the examples, we must not go too far.
In February of this year, we informed you of the arrival of the Mobilking virtual operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic belongs among the other U:phone.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to work effectively, many less customers are sufficient than a traditional operator.
They are not behind, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low price, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers text messages that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move even the bet on a group-by-group not recently.
This operator aims to say so specifically about men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator that you like and that you can trust" says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can say a concept similar to that in Poland.
It doubts the press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepíký: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of services, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"The expansion of this success project is being discussed, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations have little expectations.
Mobilking's ignition will take place rather in the other countries of our area," said Jana Studničková, the spokesman for the Penta Financial Group's press, in a phone dialogue.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are certainly not very favourable to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to prevent any competitive potential being created.
For a while he is not hiding his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first it's better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all the Czech operators of the mobile network.
We have already made progress in the negotiations with some of them," said the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So maybe there'll be better times.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual operator should have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this point, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telefónika O2.
Other operators also use the specificities of the Czech market.
The press spokesman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the statement O2: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we should have already had a concrete agreement on the table so that it could be viewed as a horizontal one."
Vodafone concentrates its attention rather on achieving its 3G licence applications.
Miroslav Čepík adds: "We are open to negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the context of the sharing of expenditure and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of our customers, to be the most productive.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile Internet."
Competent authorities -with complicit operators
The attitude of mobile telephone operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to lower profits.
Why, then, facilitate the emergence of such a competitor?
The complaints surrounding the U:fon creation testify that when operators have something they can stay on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressing towards ČTU during the U:phone creation period towards the T-Mobile company.
This testifies to public access information from the ČTU website.
But right now U:fon serves as a topic for which the virtual operator does not accept.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The environment of the competition of the mobile telephony market has been only recently enhanced with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would have to be on him and, above all, on his alleged high services."
However, the attitude of mobile telephony operators is quite surprising the complete disinterest of the Czech regulators.
It is not just the attitude of the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - that unfortunately has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this in relation to the whole issue has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator on the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the necessary infrastructure lease contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator has been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," Kristián Chalupa, the Section for External Relations, said in response to our questionnaire.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not surprise.
On the other hand, the office that must defend the interests of consumers and, above all, deal with the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In addition to where virtual operators commonly operate, we can see that their market entry has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services."
But of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices does not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
Truly shocking throughout the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question is whether it is really just a coincidence, it is on its own.
Just as the same price of petrol for all petrol is without the other fruit of the match and the competition struggle.
"The section has not found any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it has no greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools necessary for opening the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial issues .
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator, the agreement of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion, it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for ÚOHS it should be a minimum alert that three mobile operators behave in such a strange way.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators there are very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility in ČTU in telecommunications is a fairly common trick with which ÚOHS is kept out of the way.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of ČTU's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law has been updated, despite the fact that many experts expected this to improve the situation.
This is what the representatives of ÚOHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one looks
While we are not aware of the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, some of them even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile telephony services which are only partially public.
This is usually about companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-determined people.
Magic is in fact that the company in front of the operator is a classic company client, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and so on).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile telephone operators prohibit a similar provision.
"If the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, could be a breach of the contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," answered Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity would not reach the ears of the responsible operators of mobile phones.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, there are thousands of customers.
No operator defends itself at the same time from such an attitude.
In other words, the activities of these companies bring non-different profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not harmed in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepíký warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
These also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they can not have full of it as normal customers of mobile phone operators "
But that is exactly what should be a little weird at the ČTU.
In addition, there is another question for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and, if it does not want to, it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of this and whose commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has been said in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile telephony market has led to a significant decline in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The topics used were practically identical - too small a market, too saturated, problems with quality of services etc.
But in developed countries in these cases, the defence regulators have intervened, not in mobile telephone operators, but in their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and to him others agreed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators launch themselves from one to the other, all of the case, like a bowling potato.
For our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity in these cases makes him more comfortable.
But we don't throw the sponge.
If the feedback information is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the Czech mobile phone market will be back on track.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficultly ÚOHS could remain indiscriminate to the refusal (discrimination) of the other stakeholders.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech inno has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national property.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn manner the new registrations of the national child "KDE domov mój".
The new record of the inno was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with the male or female voice, choir pass and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kateřina Kněžinková and Adam Platetka.
The authors of the revisions of the property are Otakar Jeremiaháš and Jaroslav Kreček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful inni.
He already said to the radio "Česský rozhals" that he specifically chose to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried to take care that both the choir and the choir, have the clear word, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national sheep will celebrate the next year the 175th anniversary.
The song "KDE domov myj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh theatre in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroupa.
He bought popularity and people spontaneously made it his own.
The first strofa of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became the natural part of the national innocuous.
It remains one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" inno sounds
The Wednesday MDD in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic password
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers to get out of the metro, tram and bus will have an electronic wallet in their pocket instead of the ticket.
At this point, if you can find about 100 thousand people who own their Opencard password.
Passengers can buy that for 30 and 90 days and a year (which will come from the first January 2009) and at the same time recharge their own paper in the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the stop of the metro Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holesovice, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The tailors can buy from yesterday on the Internet to the Transport Company's website www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before noon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget the sports in the metro stops where they had to make long files for paper tickets so far.
The cutting is purchased online and on Opencard it is charged on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a personalized sport that will help those interested in buying online and will also record on their paper the credit they have acquired." said the spokesman for the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to load electronic cuttings on Opencards in ATMs and self-services that are installed at the entrances of the subway.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, look like the obliterators of the tickets and the passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eight," Opatrný concluded.
The cut will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard key and after payment of the cut, you will load it above.
Electronic cards are worth tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is in the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to the integrated transport of Prague there are the controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify the time and zone validity," explained Filip from the Ropid organisation, which develops the timetables for the public transport of Prague.
The urban buses have the readers of the integrated cards in the driver’s case.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the specified point next to the case.
Thus the driver checks the validity of the loaded blades.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded cuttings, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the cutting expires, they can go back to the self-service ATMs, where the cuttings are loaded on paper.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the display of the device.
The Germans of the South wanted a referendum from the USA
The Germans of the South in 1945 asked to include Shumava in the United States.
This is the result of the letter deposited in the scientific library of southern Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, as it is said, some German groups of the South turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also due to the letter preserved in a private archive and today deposited in the scientific library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Zumava district" – occupied by Hitler under the agreement of Monaco – to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises for which American units arrive in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter signed with the words "People who hold to the destiny of Shumava with all their hearts."
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans only hope of brutality, lack of respect, incomprehensibility, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to assume the protectorate on Shumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and rootes ethnic minorities and has not contributed for nothing, just for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," he writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had to doubt the Germans' conviction of Shumava , he would have just organised a referendum in the district on the willingness of his inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the history of the postwar war, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Germans of the Sudites.
Although the Czechs had to at least assume that they would have been moving from the republic, only a few of them would have admitted to such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the people of the Sudites.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the prison camp in Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans were going to find him so that he could teach him the Czech.
"These believed that once the Czech had returned home, it would have made him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, living in Czechoslovakia's wartime, he said they would have been moved from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
It is also possible to define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Răbíček is expected to discourage drivers from a dangerous behaviour to the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on the belt before leaving.
He wants to play in the consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not for the last time professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spots?
Especially stories of people who will affect their emotions.
And this also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think - you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is written in capital letters on the sign.
And in a pot of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This should symbolize that a person can pay with his life in a moment of distraction.
The spots will "save" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents can be seen in general.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech streets.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Carrots and sticks for drivers
"Autists operate the carat and baton system.
The cart for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The baton is the danger of the fine or of the accident.
You must remember the risk to the drivers," says psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the Na Homolce Hospital.
And so they want information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, they believe the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that warn the drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel has been installed that alerts to the danger, you will probably be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warned Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the restoration of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, namely the Jordanian borders, East Jerusalem and Golan's heights, in exchange for peace between the Palestinians and the Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, that is, it will be necessary to restore almost all areas (occupied), if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We fear a certain percentage of these territories, but we must leave the same percentage (of the Israeli zones) to the Palestinians, because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any refund would also include East Jerusalem.
"Those who want security in Jerusalem and above all do not want the rusts or the spies to pass on to them, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in lighting the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the mountain of the temple, the sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"Those who want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also pointed out.
The withdrawal from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke for Israel's withdrawal from the heights of Golan, that is, he believes the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollahs (the Scythian Movement); they will have to give up the permanent support they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, the Scythian Movement of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Questions after the incident: Are the stewards illegal on buses?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the long-distance bus
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the Student Agency's busman came out asking whether stewards and passengers could move on the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says Karel Hanzelka's spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The incident of the last week with which a 22-year-old hostess lost his life was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the less secure place of the bus, although there were still two other places assigned.
But the bus can cause an incident or stop abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped with or less standing positions according to the traffic book.
If the passengers are not approved, they must be seated.
The Student Agency's buses have no foothold, confirmed it at Aktuáln.cz the director of Radim Janchura.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and initially did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the place assigned," he said.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," says the Hanzelka spokesman.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law is quite a problem.
Depends on whether the bus has the approved seats.
It's all here," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are pedestrians and the maximum speed is limited, interurbans with pedestrians with higher maximum speed and long handling without pedestrians with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Horín does not find the underlying problem in the driver’s movement on the bus.
"During a quiet run there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to air service.
Even there is no safety when a turbulence occurs and the flight assistant can blow the head off."
"If the bus makes a sudden stop, obviously the laws of physics are worth it.
Just like in the city bus or on the tram.
The carrier company must solve the safety of the stewards by means of an internal regulation," he says and also believes that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jancura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers steward services..
This uses about two hundred.
The Director does not consider their profession to be dangerous even after the incident.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the steward's profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
They would also cut costs," he says.
The director of Asian Alexey Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hostess, we've opposed each other since the beginning.
First or then it will end with a fatal incident," he said less than a year ago by Týden.cz.
An enormous tragedy has occurred.
In the incident of the line for Naples, a young hostess in the region of Plzeň died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably came out of the emergency course without using the arrow and blocked the road to the pullman.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but pushed it with the front right.
Jancura rejects the fact that the two places reserved for Stewart rest were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these positions in long-distance buses, they are incendiable."
The company has in mind to report the driver of the truck.
The Agency will not wait for the Court’s judgment to pay the damages to the girl’s family, but a financial compensation is expected from the offender.
Revision of the law?
Not Visible
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than one year, could lead to specifying the Stewart movement on board buses.
"But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They don't consider them so much the buses, they take more care of the score system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the cell phone during driving," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewart's activity as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes the spokesman Havelka, who concludes that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the Director of WestLB addressed to the members of the house.
In the letter published on Monday, which could form "the center of the capital market of the financial group of savings funds" through the meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution unit with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch "a competent block" with lasting profits in such a company.
In addition, all this union could be a decisive drive for further links in the Länder banking sector.
Thus it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity for action.
Because the WestLB affliction is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having noted a long time ago to the North Rhine-Westphalia regional government that time is running out for a future solution.
Of the links between the Deca-Bank, which the same customers of the Savings Bank because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB is certainly talking about it for a while, even by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, he referred to the head of the Deca-Bank Franz Waas at the time of the presentation of the invoice of the first half of the year that a merger of the house by via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the Deka's board of directors, which is carried out by regional banks and savings banks, has delegated the board of directors to hold talks with West LB on joint contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
However, the discussions have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of those most in the business square in Frankfurt, is not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003 for a short period it seemed that the Deka-Bank could be founded with the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate and Helaba.
There was nothing from this association to three.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stockholm.
Yet they have always thought of us for a merger of the Deca-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Board of Directors, spoke against planning games to meet with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that knowledge is created, that it is necessary to bring the different homes of the public sector closer together.
Since the Bavarian Parliament was elected, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with the Baden-Württemberg could first be held.
For Helaba it's not good news at all.
If the pressure increases for other mergers, the partners will be missing.
In the south now there would be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than houses in Monaco and Stockholm.
The Asia-Turingia Savings Fund Association, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, has set the link to the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how to combat the different business models of individual houses.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be ensured, would not have been answered by the German savings fund association.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which is not desired by that of course.
Thus, the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the willingness to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the uniting of the individual parts with the Deca-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time while for Luca it's the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a partner, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them is a barium of 5l. of the Kaiser brand standing a barbarian mass and showing about 200 travellers what are the deep tones that can be produced from the throat.
Elena before Luke a package and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, they leave tonight at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Fiesta della Beera" , expected to arrive at 6.30 p.m.
Three couriers are reserved especially for Italians, in another journey only Brazilians.
In an corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so loud, says Marco, that it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long cap with fake fur hole and a pair of glasses with large silver stickers, belongs to him.
They've been going to Octoberfest for 5 years, this year there's 3 tours.
The departure of the night, day to day, back at 22.30.
Nighting would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
THE cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the meal with the Kaiser beer, made according to the Bavarian rules of genuineity, the sick case and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses go around the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Hitting the silence on the bus, the passengers sleep.
Better that way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with an Italian sign on the A9 motorway before Monaco take a short break.
When Marco's group arrives at 6.30 p.m. in the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First: put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to Marco's internet address: "Knowledge.it".
Second: "When opening the doors of the tent of beer means running!", quote Mark in the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the positions at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, but we lock, and not all the yellow berets sitting on the same benches, divide into the space at hand!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euro, Marco screams.
And don't forget to give up.
"Show the security service that we are doing well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they will disappear!"
Third: "I'll meet you here again at 22.30 p.m., you understand?"
She's already leaving for the party.
On the road, an attack as follows the yellow berrets to the trees, to the road signs and even to an advertising banner of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the "final week of Italians".
Exact data do not exist, speak of 50 thousand, leaving to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is believed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Monaco police are strengthened with 7 agents of the High Adige, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are the first with 200 medical care in front of English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially beloved by the Italians is the tent of Hofbrüaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed by the Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the policy has used the word "relative" and has also pointed out that the German banking sector is not saved from critical developments.
Because the crisis started at the end of the week.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, receives a billionaire loan from a German bank consortium to protect itself from market turbulence.
An expert on the situation said to Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay the interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the Depfa affiliate.
According to a newspaper article, the state financier has been refinanced in the short term – which is no longer possible due to the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had fallen from 95% to 2.37 million euros, even the equity ratio has fallen from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, the benefits of increases in both demand and certain actions, as well as the liquidation of savings in loans, fell by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only through higher income from the reimbursement of subordinated compensation costs arising from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the repayment of interest under the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was sufficiently moderate with approximately 16%.
The former public financier after being privatised in 1990 had lost its speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were secluded in the Aareal Bank.
As income in classical state funding was too low, Depfa has been more committed to infrastructure projects and to the financing of joint projects of private and public investors (PPPs) and has been diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now has to amortise the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Depfa is an important funder for the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks than other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between banks largely dried up because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs a part of the Depfa credit portfolio – about 50 billion – the means of refinancing in the short term.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected by the influence of the international monetary markets for the most non-functioning.
From other sources it is felt that, thanks to the money, refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the Steering Committee of HRE Georg Funke said otherwise that the HRE group would not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE Group is still insured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and the importance of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday evening the bank learned what it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The share price falls from 75% to 3.30 Euro.
The exchange rates are fairly good.
While the above-grade debts are almost irrevocable, they give up the course of the subordinated loans.
Württemberg-Hypo affiliates are mainly affected by the loans that are due to expire in 2009.
First the HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after strengthening the crisis of banks and the institution itself, be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system with the emphasis of the Depfa.
Until the least damaged central banks, governments and banks are ready, one can count on a depreciation of the annuals by the end of the day.
Or it will come into operation, what no one chances to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But with regard to the information gathered due to partial states, the probability of being almost certain has become a legitimate hope.
In particular, it will create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the reporting of losses for future payments of the countervailing tax on premiums.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of school should be presented at the Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Japanese exchange log.
The first day of school in Japan
I was excited.
I also had a fifa to go to school.
I go to the outskirts of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tacibana High School.
The road had to be found by myself, and fortunately I didn't lose.
The beginning of the first class does not seem to have been fixed as we did in Lower Saxony.
The schoolchildren arrive at the plan from 8 a.m. until 8.40 p.m. a brief interview with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
However, I am not the type who speaks voluntarily in front of people, in front of a class of 40 students
Since I had not yet had my school uniform, I put on an old mother's dress, along with a shirt, blue pants and black leather shoes.
Dressed like that, I put myself in front of the cathedral and tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate in a week of my birthday.
At the time, I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class were screaming, scratched and signed, and I continued to hear the word "Kawaii".
I've known her since my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lesson of Japanese girls to survive and it means "sweet, sweet".
Then I ran fast to my place.
The girl next to me bowed, it was an honor for her to sit next to a exchange student
The rest of the class was continued quietly, but when he played the gang, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They all talked indisordinously and started to laugh and dry me with questions – then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket-- it's different from the stupid German breads.
I had risotto with spices, salsicins, lemon salad and algae, fruit and a kind of wrap with meat and tofu..
To tell the truth, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the hall, brr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl presents a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of making the boy know during recreation.
I read it in my Manga drawers.
I'm really curious if I can find out.
"Why exactly is Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Why I'm fascinated"
Finally, I've been reading the Mangas for years with fervor.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning Japanese a little.
I was absolutely convinced we'd come once.
I am also fascinated by traditions, customs and customs.
There's a lot of them here.
On the one hand Japan is a place of technology and latest trends -the opposite: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a rat flees when they feel the danger. Does that mean they also feel the fear?
The neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: even so many animals have feelings.
4. But how could it be possible to see if, when they behave in our same way, they have our own feelings?
Articles of well-known scientists have been published on the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents the answers chosen to the question: "What do you think it is true, without being able to try it?"
I think animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having ever tried it, because we can't even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we address the other species and ask questions about feeling or generally about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not fight.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do. That is, he pretends to be dead, running away or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists realize that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral frontal cortex is often linked to human awareness, the associated circuits (this for its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this vast area is much more developed than in other primates and seems to be missing among the other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our awareness of the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis on which man is supposed to differ from even the other primates is thus admitted.
Another dramatic particularity should be presented in the way of speaking about man: since much of life is connected to the language, it is often said to be connected to the conscience.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animal, as it is done, surely differs greatly from the circumstances of our conscience.
This is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, by analyzing it through its own experience because of the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this, there is another aspect of the consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analysed without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in the studies on the short memory of primates, particularly in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, it goes first to the neural correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the display.
What, then, is meant by feelings?
I blame them for the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the memory of work.
In view of this, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the talking nature we create subtle shades of feeling, because we can distinguish and categorize situations with the help of words and grammar, to describe them to others.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings are the most primitive activities in the regions of the body of the cortex sensations and of the headache, similar to Jack Pankseep, which however concentrated more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could certainly be part of the extended feelings of the species.
At a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I consider it to be indiscriminate.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and human beings to be like fear is likely to be this way of warning in both cases: but how could it happen if rats and human beings prove the same when they behave in a similar way?
Is a crash in case of danger running away as if he also felt fear?
In my eyes, the simple similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
And so the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephalus, the scarfs not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalo responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to humans, how would you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there are progresses at the neural level, as long as you abandon the same procedure on rats and men.
Since I don't research language and consciousness in rats, I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This can be considered myopic, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than constantly fighting against a wall.
I'm a practical emotional on this point.
The President of UEFA Platinum: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise Europe with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries."
Both the master countries of the house are in the march table for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of stages to be allocated to Europe will eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work as fast as possible," said the president of the Ukrainian Association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After many scandals, the Polish PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that PZPN will not be able to operate in accordance with the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP information agency.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparations for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Many exhibitors of the first division were sentenced only in the last season for manipulation, and at the end we had to return to the beginning of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid Retired Angry
He wanted to promote a new film, he talked about the private and now he's hungry with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his ex Dennis Quaid an adult.
He sneezes with rage and rage.
War of the late Roses for the former married couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other about a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week expressed himself for the first time on the grounds of marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful."
The scope of the betrayals you would have come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the "mind of the soul" was the work with Ryan's print for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared to be an adult husband was clear: it would be "inaudible", he said on Thursday at the "New York Daily News", which "Meg for the next time repeats and recasts the story of our relationship".
It would also be "deplorable" that in Jack , the sedentary son who had together again "be remembered publicly the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments are closed with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I think I'm lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Low prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and accommodation in the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, observed a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places are already low.
From January to March, prices are rising in 41 of the 48 European cities still on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay up to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees this as the reason for the weak dollar quote, which would lead to a "hot desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hanover, Colonia or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
As regards the prices of flights, the trend in the first quarter still points to:
Because of the backlog of the kerosene passengers in the Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range intensive fuel flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, the air fares for the Economy Class fell on average 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, but in the first class and business, price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose from 11,9 %, in the second quarter to 23,6 %.
As for domestic German flights according to the study, prices were even half the price.
The reason for price collapse would be economic growth on the one hand, the company explains.
The demand in many parts of the air travel market has been broken down.
On the other hand, there would be an open-air agreement that liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
The sign of the critical situation would be the abolition of non-profit routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, the Hamburg SV becomes a capolist.
In Borussia Luhukay is still unable to find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein is making the landing worse for the player of the national Marko Marin .
The Gladbach player first came into play late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was accurately formulated, passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger exclaimed in the cabin corridor of the Hamburg arena.
It didn't happen though in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of them were sitting back in their place.
Rieger has been a physical therapist for nearly 3 decades of HSV, enjoying an even greater estimate of some old players.
And so his monk also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol drowned and raised the police in a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach head of the Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The position change did not occur.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "more relaxed".
For the 1st to the zero, those in Hamburg must thank the head hit by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the many weak players in Gladbach could not harm the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The Hamburg SV this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators already celebrated before, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the shining classification on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We are able to put everything in place," said Marcel Jansen.
It has the presentation that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the sample than of its HSV domination.
The team with its new arrivals arrived late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric gate as well as Jansen blown to the FC Bayern – finds himself slowly, but is not yet able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling", he relaunches with Jol.
After the defeat of the vote
Wall Street is surrounded by fear.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package has temporarily crashed the Dow Jones of 700 points.
This was the greatest loss of points in the space of a day of his history.
Later, the Down came back a bit.

The dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: the dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze quickly, it is now up to you to die for freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the Swing-by anomaly
The Swing-by is a space probe flight manoeuvre with which they obtain additional slant/spint/scillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example from the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical file as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What surprises scholars for years: races do not behave at all as they would expect under the law on gravity.
In fact, there are irregularities at the speed.
The probes are suddenly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
Swing-by's anomaly was reborn this year.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curve of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes as before Einstein failed, and tries to explain Swing-by's anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of the dark matter, space scientists have only known for about 10 years.
Obviously a force of attraction emerges from her, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is visible.
Instead, it is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, the dark matter is at least one fifth of the total mass of the cosmos.
Rape tourists in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shootout before the release 6 kidnappers were killed.
In southern Egypt, 5 Germans were kidnapped.
The rescue negotiations are already under way.
The Germans are always in the eyes of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was consistent with the Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the chronicle of the Italian TV broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their health status," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of an expedition into the desert are already on the way to Cairo.
It is still unclear whether the return of a shooting took place before the release of the hostages: therefore, after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer, the kidnappers would have been ready to conclude the kidnapping before the Sudanese army had killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the officer said.
It would have been "just tried to take hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had claimed from Germany a rescue of EUR 6 million; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would have been delayed because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women in hostage after the ransom was paid.
Men would have to stay in custody until the kidnappers had had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report .
Patriarch's abuses "carried to suicide"
Years of abuse by the patriarch brought a woman to kill herself, he declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornovaglia, was in prison for 6 years after he admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a note of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had killed herself in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise bothered her and beat her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornovaglia.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that caused her.
In 2006, Public Minister Ramsey Quaife told the court that Mrs. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and who had "feeled with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
You think you killed yourself by suffocating yourself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's father, who wrote a letter of confession that ended up saying, "I read and bless her."
"I didn't bother you sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "He is an extremely strange fetishist, and for his victim he must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This sad saga ends with the victim who takes life away.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to be ended before the court."
I know the effects that Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter in these years.
" Otherwise it was clearly likely that she was a promising and happy young man of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The official of the Cabinet Office who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Official Secrets Act, he learned the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal attempt.
The BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They would have thought that this was dealt with internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer should be accused by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The lost documents contained assessments of al-Qaaeda and Iraq's security forces' capabilities.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and brought to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
The British construction companies could face an account of more than £800,000 after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has given 14 billion sterlings to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley's savings.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the savings money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was "irritant" that companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion sterling loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans will be redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have behaved prudently are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will raise to 450 million sterlings in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company association, told the BBC that he thought it was unfair.
"It's annoying that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the home-retrieved market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," Mr Cole added.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year at the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk salt at 5 Penny per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale prices of her milk for an extra five-penny per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two Pennys in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Refusal of bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him a guarantee for having sued 50 million taka ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of Parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges against us.
The political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, had long been released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next few weeks but his party, Awami League, asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military give the full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can remain in liberty when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has refused the bail request for Sheikh Hasina by claiming that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical care," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall bring an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina's home is expected to return after October 17th, said a senior leader of the Awami League party on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government attached to the military took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan anti-police campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The United Nations has launched a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it's said he can't reach the kids in the Helmand and Kandahar parts of the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this would happen despite the pledges of the Taliban that would not have attacked or impeded thousands of staff carrying the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival television station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the court of appeal of the competition to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Earlier, the Commission had said that BSkyB’s participation hindered competition and allowed for unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB purchased the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's participation in ITV sows doubts about the independence of ITV, thus making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
The head of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV strike was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the US Prosecutor
The US Attorney General appointed a special Ministry of Public Affairs to examine the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation takes place when a report on the case is submitted by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Critical Justice on the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
The Public Special Ministry Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Series accused of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or investigated," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said lawyers had been fired for late performance.
But later it turned out that the licensed lawyers had not been more rated as late as many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in judicial action against Republican members of the High-Profile Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and bring cases to court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was then in the discharge storm, and finally he recognized his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice were fired.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales's role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the discharges, which he had abdicated to his role as leader and had been exceptionally dissipated during the process.
Other officials, including Bush Senior Assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The Epica of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for its epic swim Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the track of the 1977 hit by Meat Loaf.
Coldplays will run the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that go beyond things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, demanded a strong voice that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opens with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was produced as a single in UK in 1979 and reached its fifteenth place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained in class for almost nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart beat in 2003 after collapsing on the stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel and concerts.
He came out later that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark streets of town, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous ones, others just for use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and residents have long found it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, especially because they have never heard of it.
The small road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty street than an active traffic route.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlant.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner walk for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-standing close friends who say they were hit by the road simply because it was one of the last remains of the noble neighborhood of the past.
But the city's conservation and development department, which has road control, is not interested in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the District Community Commission, some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay have drawn up a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the head of the Community Board 3 district.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to regulate and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that he wanted to reopen the small street and install seats, including some to be used for a café where the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renovate this street and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Accommodation, said that it was in fact the city's desire to sell the road and made it clear that the purpose of the agency was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slightly historical print.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802 when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps better known as the photo set for the album cover of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was beautiful," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"He was full of immunization, scarves of clothes and pieces of boots, posters, sheets, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about "gentrification" of the East Village, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, suggesting that the piece of public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of the city almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (titled "The Book of Griefs: A Some Nostalgic Look at the City in the Way of Extinction"), published part of a talk about the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an unexplained, dark, day-to-day, and limited storage doors in rustic iron and windows with saracinese, with old weekly newspapers that walk along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocrat clothing store.
There were graffiti on the walls and a bottle of empty beer of 22 ounces of jaces near a group of abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but they suggest they need to be a little dressed up.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks that some people underestimate the attractiveness of the road in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: dive into English
In this point of Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in the studies of California and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
To really attract Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "African and Latin American students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transition bilingual education" for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in a language class other than English, does not take into account his interest in fulfilling the learning differences.
We take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
School students are for the Spanish and low income majority.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of students did a higher level test in the 2008 maths exam.
A equally surprising 93% of fourth-century students have done the expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from that preferred by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes the review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of "no excuse".
Furthermore, and it is here that Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street, of the obstructive approach of the school for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered class 12 months after you were unable to identify what it was".
"It works," he observed "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its continued support for bilingual education prevents Mr Obama from predicting the answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently ignored the issue when he said people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps of achievement, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise them or trivialize them.
Oil shuts down sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices are falling sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The future of the grey fell from 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel to New York's stock market in the morning.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the raw materials markets have been driven by Wall Street's financial turmoil, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 at the barrel in June, prices were broken up to almost $90 at the barrel at the beginning of this month, before rising again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety affected investors again Monday even after the congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement at the end of the week on the rescue plan, the biggest of history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from past.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the Fortis European financial conglomerate.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the weekend's frenzy negotiations had led to a rescue agreement " seemed to have failed to revitalize the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, we expect the demand for raw materials, including oil, to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape from the contamination.
From a perspective of raw materials our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the coming year, while household oil consumption due to slowdown in economic growth, reducing forecasts on the price of oil and gas by about 20 per cent for 2009.
The operation in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time with the Jets uniforms in the last eight and more seasons, the defendant Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he looked at it taking place on the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without points into a recovery.
"More like this," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had leveled the greys of the menacing clouds that prevailed over them with a fiasco game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranus Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon in which their growing symphony made a huge move forward.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns in the room, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the passes to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Cole were playing catch games, the defense hit the quarterback of Cardinals Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a wave launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
The security of Eric Smith has scheduled another passage and has intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner Fumble.
The last tournament, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets took over the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feelly took a 20-yard target for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets have ever marked in a room.
When asked to describe his madness, the coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second or the third?"
When he was told - the Jets gave 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second fourth much more than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselasia resting exceeds her world record
Hail Gebrselasia of Ethiopia has shown again why many consider it the best marathon ever, breaking its own record of the world to the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a race of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the race favorablely planned at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sends in fractures for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie has developed the 26th record of the world of such a bad career that it has produced a world championship or a record of the world at any distance from the metro mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasia jumped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would have worsened its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselasia won Sunday with an average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-founders like Gebrselasia and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago she had the popcorn cracks and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie said to the reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at the end everything went well."
It was a bit criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having orchestrated its races excessively, generally avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, counting on apripiste as if it were a mid-end race, and putting the world's records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely reduce the size of Gebrselasia's skills as a marathon.
With the step falling by four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselasia reached the halfway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, kept in competition Gebrselasia after the apriests disappeared.
Just over three miles from arrival, Gebrselasia made a final commitment to separate from Kwambai, who ended up at 2:05:36, improving her personal best time in almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprising winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad incident, but she was cured to win Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she has run.
She ran a race doing well with the calculations, leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to leave with a great distance, taking her back about 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya ended third at 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in an extensive theme park on Orlando’s suburbs, a few miles from the splendor, from the noise, from the huge, lies the quiet city where pride and the complications of African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black town incorporated in the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skin, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, Harlem Renaissance's most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city that described - and that makes tourists stop by including it in the tourist guide of Florida produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a place apart.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, doesn't know what is missing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain indifferent to the look of the outsider.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident of the whole life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power takeover and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example of the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the southern blacks - sometimes demeaned, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both fair and protective.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, who everybody here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five sections of the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a granasse in both life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then turned into more private areas.
"Get out of the way to the left," he wrote, "it's the modern public school, brown with the white finishings, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales drinks of all kinds and whatever fits into the passage rooms".
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This clearly wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"When she said it was like she was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls, who Hurston killed her by quoting men who sing big songs about their beauty.
Add: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston was in town, he usually arrived without notice in a triumphal Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that today boasts of decent clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were being harassed.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, walking on his chair on the patio on the upper back of the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were printed.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it.
Although once he was a literature star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in a grave without a sign in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big commemorative ceremonies, and no big conference.
"I don't believe they understand his contribution to the world or his leave to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-course road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed the Interstate 4 across the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle on racial mix led to hatred at the door of the community's home.
"During that period, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things to the people who were sitting on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed that time.
They threw a coconut from a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "a insult rather than an honor for my race".
The residents now say that the deregregation of schools, although positive in some respects, spreads the cohesion of Eatonville and restores the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the Executive Director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher--I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcome the prejudices, as he did, with joyful security of himself and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker started a long way for the unmarked Hurston grave and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit the bookstore sheds, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as her most famous daughter had again been blocking the lights of the roaralta.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January, many returned for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
"The five courses of the resurrected highway, brought what would be called the high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project helped to change the image the city has of itself.
Those outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new bookstore on a single plan (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a rediscovered and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to search for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interview, in some things - like walls on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a fat-ass teacher, with a weak for the bright red, still fears that their island community will become fragile.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of public pride also emerged.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville with Hurston see his entire race: beautiful, trouble and everything, no better, no worse and fair, creative, great worker, shocked and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is truly civil affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's grandson, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just got in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after putting in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a nice city."
Here in New York we all talk fluidly about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspaper banking and the huge television screens of Times Square, they would not be aware of the cycle.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nestled on their heads by bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York every day live the worst "gross day in office" since the 1929 crash.
The factories squeak metal carts for the the through the marches, carrying muffin vessels for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and stretched shirts to a stick on their back.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning baggage to be taken to the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the speech of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new saving book Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the scene so that it would coincide with the afternoon break to my JP Morgan Chase branch, a number of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's sport, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service sport, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions for the big Macy store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those before me, I would have learned from Starr, my trust banker, were in line for the same reason.
On the contrary, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from the places where the pendants, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called trifts (a bit like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries only operate within a state, and say to treat customers as family members.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was subject to controlled administration, and while the New Yorkers were headed home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and commissions that were in front of me, impounded by another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkese in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman to my Chinese confidence supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and her emaciated Director General Dick Full in all familiarity, as if we were wetting a bad colleague.
And Lynn, the uniformed Portinaia, almost fifty years of my condominium, has changed the subject compared to our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!".
I've changed, I'm not running any risk."
Pronounced Muslim grave as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right wing of the Party of Liberty and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organisation "City Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They're carrying signs like those road representatives of the mosque with a red line passing through the middle.
The police accused the right extremists of profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the right won a lot at the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun's cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was organized.
The culprits have traced with the spray Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but the detectives believe it might have been an attempt to mask the extremist motivations driven by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the defamation, which happened toward the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance for Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria has embarked on a spiritual research trip following its right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that took almost 30 percent of the votes, the party of Austrian freedom and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, made a campaign with vicious anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Party of Freedom who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against the veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to the foods that were perceived as related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and mines, bringing them to political symbols of continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought to the fore by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the glamour star of the guilty rock of sexual abuse on minors, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain from the court.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities who were controlling him that he wanted to go to Spain by passing through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after he had provided the magistrates with evidence of earlier Glitter's arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's arrest in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford's detention, the Kent police have filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present."
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the register of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police a seven-day notice of his expected departure.
Failure to notify the authority may result in a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent's police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter's movements in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's police said: "Kent's police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have suitable complete systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's residents is Kent's main concern and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of convicted persons for sexual offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he had to board a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have made it through passport checks and then taken a flight to Hong Kong at the end.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's detention in West London since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to register him for sexual offences.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having images of abuse of children.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt assured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the teacher away from the scene to extract the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no flying, no clothes from the front.
Only the essence of the great teachers of the Flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
By the way, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, at those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressivity of the hands, are natural because they must not go on stage.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alters the theatre of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on the stage with the least known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of the Flamenco, taking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These portraits "on the street" are "artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and catching the public.
To catch the personality of these great ones you don't have to pull them back into the scene,
because their personality and character are internal.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the big flamenco."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long journey in 1997 to pull back singers, guitarists or dancers using a tape recorder.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remember the classic photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, capable of winning the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way to feel and to be, were and have been the constant of this work, in display in these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous Flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits displayed on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Retracts of veteran athletes" ("SportARTProject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to draw people, to know them and to penetrate them for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult kind in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters you sometimes don't even know or give you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary Flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is prepared at the gallery El Fotómata, the number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel you're writing is a "gap"
It is situated in places that still do not know and deal with unknown issues: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is on the run with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived for twenty years in the Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
Always favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project that is currently underway "is a gambling" and that "everything indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had a good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it as well and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passing through the city of the Aqueduct a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city y los perros" was, as prognostically speaking, the figure of peak at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens's book "Our Mutual Friend", filled out the positions of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a public to whom the time had flown when the Peruvian, with a magnificent memory and with great doses of humor, recalled as born in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "like to read" and "live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous recovery; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an exhilarating experience," said Vargas Llossa, arguing that, on the contrary, "has effects" and that "gives the most anti-conformist people." That is why he invited writers to "do not give up on cowardice" and to "take responsibility" of his vocation.
Time hinders the Festival of Pozoblanco, depriving it of the race
The celebration of the races that should have highlighted the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the tournaments selected for the races had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Weather came against this Festival, preventing two days of celebration on three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bull race.
They included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who should have faced a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Friday.
On this occasion Daniel Luque was triumphing, cutting three ears and coming out in triumph, after having bullied with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante finished his two races by receiving greetings and an ear, given more from the public than due to the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing from the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without punishment.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mullet, he earned the boards of most of the public.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish crossing the block to Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
The officers hold the two occupants high in a van and instead of stopping, they run away.
Agents have hired the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, ran away.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After being prosecuted, the agents manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A.A. J., as reported in the communication from the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and the falsification of public documents.
The incident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Arminón.
They insisted on stopping a van for the inspection when the driver, overstepping the orders, hurried quickly and crossed the lockpoint.
The agents went to the chase until the vehicle, after a couple of miles, stopped on the road and its two occupants went to the escape in a forested area.
The Ertzaintza agents were therefore able to arrest one of the fugitives and kidnap the 2.178 kilograms of hashish that they carried and took note of once inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panes, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
Furthermore, since officials found that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not match the one reported in the truck documentation, the arrester was also charged with the crime of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A. J., was taken to the police station to conduct appropriate procedures and be available to the judge within the next few hours.
Arrest the actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effect of drugs
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
One witness saw him take risks while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the People magazine by a spokesman for the California street.
The witness stated that around 16.30 the Locklear "screwed the accelerator deep, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with abrupt moves forward and back. Making retrocar, he passed several times before his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first sight apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
This person was alerting emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"He seemed confused," and that's why the agents took him to a specialist drug and alcohol centre to test him.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has been cooperative and the assumption of alcohol abuse has been discarded since the beginning, even though "as seen by officers at first, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 7 p.m. to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was restored by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The UI coordinator general and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, today confirmed that it would be up to the regional federation of training to take a decision on the case of the former adviser to Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of customerism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said as to the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been an adviser to this day in the Civilian Council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations concerning the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this kind of investigation to be the most transparent."
He also stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public charges."
"The Blood of Mayo", Garci's epic bet
In inspired by Episodios Nacionales di Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci proposes in Sangre de Mayo the famous Spanish rebellion against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría leading a wide cast of interpreters.
Bloodre de mayo, for more than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become in the future a television ministration of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this revolution "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before he turned a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2. The director had agreed that the story of basses on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated entirely by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to re-create the appropriate scenarios and customs to reflect a "storted Spain which misjudged the choice of the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence led to a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to that of Alatrist or Los phantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangres de Mayo, so it was not possible to spin some scenes planned by the scenario he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Volver at the beginning, influenced what is his usual practice, the stage with the actors, with which he often tries to spin together those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "demeaning," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to the theater and cinema to know what is going on in the sector where he works."
Many of the interpreters, part of whom are included in the Sangre de Mayo cast, try their car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate for Oscar four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood - its Sangre de Mayo, Sié mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should be known instead."
Garci doesn't expect prizes from this movie.
"At first you think you work for posters, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you agree to just turn a movie into more," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon retrieves the Sivilian essence of the ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Sivilian dancer pays tribute to another dancer as well as to Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgia Valencia Valenzuela), born in Triana district, and three years old moved with the family to London.
It was a free dance dancer and an Oriental dance specialist.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
This woman's life, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I'd love to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offers me this character.
It supports the ballerina: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to collect the spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of the Flamenco.
So, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some thongs.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dancing style is also part of this aesthetic," she explains.
The stage includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his performances, as she did in "The Open Door"; and that of Master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what she had been a student.
"Matilde interprets Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because you have accepted to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The composition also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi of Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who interprets the role of the eternal companion of these artists who have been divided all round, and who have always had many spasms."
The work is also present in some ways the life of this woman, which is taking place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it, because I think it is one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers it and so much less considers its operation as something of value," Bayon says.
The show will begin today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un a recién married poet", the Triennio also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reiencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Advisor to the Culture of the Andalusia Joint to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and that of the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-enactment of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum house and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Chopo de lucid", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is planned to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Advisor to the Culture of the Andalusia Joint has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poete Reiencasado", by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the highest value Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and all America, in view of the confusing idea that Newman has gone.
Yet it cost him a lot to deliver an Oscar to him.
And since 2007, he's been retired.
And you also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
A father of cinema and homeland was killed in a particularly dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, in the desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men like that without virtue and are good people to admire, it doesn't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, it was the ideal platonic of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn dead of overdose to the creation of the brand of domestic and biological food.
All donations to a country where it is very expensive to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without curing themselves of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, observed that a man was not killed, an era was over.
Another English director, Sam Mendes, who was awarded Oscar, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the culmination of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, had chanced to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high level for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping the need for justice in high regard and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for 50 years with Joanne Woodward, who remained faithful even though he certainly did not miss the opportunity to be.
"Why am I going to eat out of Hamburger today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles he played, none of them were as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, zealous grandfather and passionate philanthropy," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will take place in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was far from the worst thing I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if they were then taken into account in the assessment and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The shocks began with the retreat of the back, which meant he was going first.
It didn't seem to be a wrong idea, but if they force you to go, it's for pulling everything off (including the chip to avoid codes during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go only to take the backbone (first foolishness, only go for this) and (after the relative tail), surprised! they had only 'S' size shirts (second foolishness, because I need an XL size).
In what world do we live?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small shirts made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inescapable compared to the same day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to get the chip, the waiting line was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the bag.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started that we had not even deposited the bag, although, once it was successful in the company, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the expectation of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and assault to the stand were added.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the correct classification due to the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will not enter my mind.
So I think we're going to keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Seeker Receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the campus of the company) by assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a facial recognition system, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the video, for example, the receptionist finds a third person, but realizes that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
Ask her if she's there to visit someone and tell her she'll be at her disposal soon.
Everything without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week a lot has been discussed about a change in strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were equipped with essential and less commercial waste, they would have to go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
A complete discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is becoming more and more important, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome in the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an indispensable element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same for your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the Web browser.
You only take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and daily we spend more time browsing online than in a remote window environment.
What are half of the operating system applications used for?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to form a valid alternative to Google.
They need a desperate need, in fact, and I bring here a small example.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees, at Redmond, at the beginning of this month.
On the drink machine a folder urges them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees are using Google to do online research.
Last week, the delay was confirmed in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be placed on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is criminalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Côte d'Ivoire, Leonardo di Caprio, in 'Diamante de blood' by Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'Il Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola, as well as being part of the typical uniform of the Muscular Gay parish.
And if we try to list the stars' appearances, we can recall the image of the force with the pointed buffs that lift the weights in the walking circle.
It is, in essence, the typical man-made shirt, with the inside of cotton, attached and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, even though the Belgian Fabuleus Marcel points out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stamp and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt wear as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels with others for the high quality cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stamp and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tank".
It also includes college velvet, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailor shirts, baby-dolls, mini short...
Intimacies thought to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as intimate underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't care"
The great similarity with the sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, Sisters Cruz have taken their new activity in the fashion field very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who give their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the company Mango has made of its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Hot and shy, it'll take you fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we invented my sister Penelope and me for the autumn-winter season in Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time exciting.
What are the elements of your new collection for Mango in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both like the movie of the 1950s and '60s, and from here we get various inspirations.
Then I love to lose myself in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even though in the end, everything is inconclusive and there are many elements in common.
I, even from my youth, liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to enjoy my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the game park.
Then, once I danced, I always paid a lot of attention to dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to lesson and wisdom, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they deliver your wardrobe, it's the moment you really meet the character.
So everything goes together, yes, with great respect for the stylists and professionalisms.
Not long ago, you've been in a crisis for 30 years?
Not at all.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted as a child, and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my own body asks me that and I want to be a young mom, and I don't want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I don't care too much.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for some films to be filmed in different rooms last year.
That's right, and I really want them to come.
Being a woman coming from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like it all to be immediately and clearly, but it can't always be that way.
I want it to be "the last hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you'll like it.
A few days ago, you started on a walk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was in a walker like a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Done for a better world" and the clothes we have performed – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to collect funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this soft side of Naomi.
They say so many things about her, that I know her for a long time I can confirm that they're not so true.
I also find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to show up for a noble cause, but if he asked me to make the pineapple, I would have done the same.
If it is to help women in the third world, you can't go back.
Relapse alcoholic drivers will need to install the "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive blood alcohol, install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of pregnancy or if it does not blow up in the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the General Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which it will be a pilot project of one year's duration.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to be a road rehabilitation course.
In addition to the General Research for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Road Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once per driving in a state of pregnancy then drive the car again.
The alcohol would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the breath and prevents driving if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than that permitted.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be charged to the penalty.
In this respect, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that vehicles fitted with these devices allow to reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain, it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, and, without a doubt, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally into some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote in favour of a PSOE initiative which proposes to install this system on the school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the second program, the Spanish aircraft in which the Asturias principles were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico City.
The sun was waving, but the rays still forced them to use their hand as a viewer to see the real couple come down from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver, for the road, if he knew that the Spanish principles were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, okay, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
- No, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport crushed to the red carpet and the military cord made up of 27 Marine soldiers offering a greeting of honor.
The prince seems smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, blows to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City he was threatening bad time.
They give the photographers a smile and a brief pause before going to the room where the official company awaits them.
At the door of the hotel in which they stay, one of the four largest in the city, awaits them a spiritual reporter of Mexican television.
Best award offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world most suitable to present a fashion award, which is not Paris and probably there is no more exquisite and vibrant stylist of Valentino.
Mango just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in Mango's glass at number 54 by Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out.
On the other hand, it is the second largest company store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square metres of extension.
The first one is in London.
Many events, combined with the desire to please the Stylist Valentino who chaired the competition jury, started with a luxury dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite TVs, the presidential table of gala prepared by Mango, it proved even more spectacular.
Born, with a heart broken and making necessary virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some ELAH supplements to remove the fiat and arm of the son Luis - a boy nearly two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the chair of the hosting dinner.
Andik, owner and gentleman of Mango, has done the honors of the house and of knights who, along with Barone Rotchil, had finished, without jacket, because both of them had surrendered to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – changed for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the hall for ballet sages and she, remembering other times, caught up with a bar and knocked out a "great fold".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the palace premises, but had shown us first the pictures of his son on the cell phone.
The following day we were pleased to see Olivier Martinez – another boy who moved on - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his linens, his towels and made sure in advance that there was no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and one way to forget the chaotic and frenzy daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all gathered in a book that will bring the relaxation in the bookstores on September 30th.
Awakening is almost a punishment when it wakes up every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine involved in the frenzy of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's bad back.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there is not one or two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the fatigue to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or "sppa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects a "menu" of options on the pages of her book, custom-made for taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone thinks that it is not possible to gain peace in areas such as work or in personal relations, this "manual" denies such conviction.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not already flow into your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, shut your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk in your sleep
Some kids talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who are very excited to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who speak are still asleep.
The first time that happens, there is a fear at most, but it really doesn't matter much.
This is a slight change in the sleep defined as sleepy sleep.
It is manifested with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, most of you have been told that you spoke in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadicly (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing more.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes episodes are related to other sleep disorders such as incubation, night fear, night enuresis (to make the sleeping pipe), or somnambulism, but not necessarily so.
As previously noted, it can be associated with very high fever levels, with stress situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it is a still not studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet voice tone, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite occurs (sigh, yell, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, you should observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there are any issues that are generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outcome to the situation.
We have said that this is a benign change, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g. if combined with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to bed.
Offer quiet games and avoid programs or television series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is easy to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the dreams appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the day after it will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because it's not aware of what's going on, and you've interrupted his sleep.
Though he's talking, he's sleeping and he's resting.
Remember that if you seem very upset and the episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check where this great anxiety comes from in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You will not get anything, because it is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize your thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what you say but not to see what you are dreaming to say, so you need to pay great attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which they might lead.
Never tell the child that you can ask questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even for jokes.
Something like this causes a lot of anxiety.
Soon, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Island user... finally
Illhaeuern finally found the way home to victory after a long time of infertility.
Without playing a great game, the Yellow-Necks have created the largest number of network opportunities transforming one into the game win.
The rhythm was not very supported during this meeting when the attackers expressed themselves tired.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann host team who blew the seven with a long shot, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of Denmark, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain high and still Diebold.
The Danemarie responded with a block at the center of the camp, leaving only the Riahi chain at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riahi and Temporary for Denmark, and immediately after the first Marais network for the Illhaeuern, well positioned, he took up a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Cannon of the Illhaeusen will not be able to enjoy his long happiness and will be expelled a dozen minutes after leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Denmark will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause major problems to the Elevens of the Illhaeuern, directed just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rock action, the ball ran out the cross.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a step in Britain.
Prior to the demonstration of fishermen who brutally prevented access to various British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the Finistère department to enthrall representatives.
The latter have promised to accept it "with a constructive spirit" and hope that it will "present itself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by British fishermen to take measures to address the impenetrable gas price, which reached its record with an average of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseo's spokesman, David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and ensure working conditions and the remuneration of the sailors".
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "lumaca operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of ingestion.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections with Belle-île have not been interrupted.
A road block was implemented on the island of Quiberon.
On Monday, the sailors had already proved their determination by burning tires and pallets from the dawn in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while they were holding demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishermen remained at the mill, or in Havre, where twenty battles prevented the movement of the ships from trading.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Atlantic Loire, interrupted in the evening the total note of Donges refinery.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday in order to decide on any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting planned for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the national fishing committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give up" and "they do not intend to move to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas, currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but consider that the yield limit of a ship is only reached with a gas of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the film and actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
The Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year, the aircraft construction company has 215 deliveries, despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth global company in the sector, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company is widely trusted in the Chinese market, especially for aircraft of the range between 30 and 120.
To this day, Embraer delivered 41 air to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group's insurance company, which was set up by the American monetary authorities, would provide more than 15% of its activities in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is prepared to consider the sale of much of its activities, in addition to the supply of life insurance branches to the international market and to the United States, specifying the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from the AIG.
The activities that AIG intends to assign include the International Lease Financial Corp. air lease subsidiary, its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concessions from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities impose 80% of its capital.
Paris: Chronistora Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against Paulson's plan for the rescue of financial institutions: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. a drop ever seen, approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) has finished at 10,365,45, below 777,68 points.
In terms of points, the worst of losses in its history (684,81 points) exceeds that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199.61 points closing at 1.983.73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1.106.55, standing at the definitive closing figures.
Depressed at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street is deep after the unexpected rejection of the bank's rescue plan, designed to bring stability back to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans on three rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piezza, of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market was counting on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was actually dying (...) then the witness would quickly be transferred to the Fed – Federal Reserve- (the U.S. central bank, ndr) and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, responsible for the financial and economic sector at the Global Insight.
And while still highlighting the state of emergency," every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, he stressed.
After the collapse of Friday's Washington Mutual, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated rapidly, urging emergency action in favour of UK banks, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, signaling that markets "are not only faced with an American crisis but also with a global crisis", FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The return of 10-year-old Treasures is returned to 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday evening, while that with 30-year-old is 4,161%, against 4,357% of the day before.
Obama in favour of the first television duo
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, there is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the republican and democratic campaign proclaimed their victory of the television duo, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although worthy, was not bright enough to allow him to slow down in the five-week polls by the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives an advantage of five points in Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them considered Obama the winner, while 25% pointed to McCain.
A great performance by his partner on the Joe Biden list, expected during the first and only debate with the rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday the advantage of Obama.
"I'm guessing it would be a mistake.
He has a good insight," however, Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The Seventeenth McCain has never ceased to promote his indisputable foreign policy experience, stressing the "ingenuity" of the opponent regarding the arguments raised during the first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." he has often said to many retrievals.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the skills needed to become president," he said.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without an extension, it has proved to be concise and precise.
It promoted its readiness to make the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world scene.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama," he reiterated, this weekend, a democratic spot, insulting the Republic for not taking the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety-nine minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a rain, for an election meeting.
He did not even pronounce the words "media class" or "workers". The financial crisis is in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipitation.
"The next week could be a decisive development," thought democratic influential Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intuitivity to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's results, the Illinois Senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of potential energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a 45 nuclear power plant by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously ignored the $700 billion financial-saving applications (EUR 470 billion) adopted the Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents protested Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday night immediately after the closing of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislation.
While the results were still waiting, many young people came to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignations".
Some people confess that they have not even voted: "To what pro? They will do as much as they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good figure for foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to undertake a democratic process.
The sanctions, including visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
I haven't been, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral committees and our observers have not been able to take part in the stealing of the votes," lamented Jouri Potemkine, spokesman of the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a face-to-face change," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidents and head of the pro-European movement, as the important one is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If opposition Members come to Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can include a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has the duty to join the political game as "the dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we are at risk of becoming a Russian protector.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that ‘the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the electoral process.
It underlines that participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has led to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections? Asks Social-Democratic Leader Alexandre Kozuline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will have been up to five Members of the opposition to Parliament, the ones most suitable to power."
The night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Committee are pleased to see their success.
Meeting - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday's tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as Hema-Québec became one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained public confidence, seriously removed from the blood scandal infected in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994 , led by Judge Horace Krever, which sought to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying a report, some provinces set up a committee to devise a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood collection and field research over the years, we have regained public confidence," he said, before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population had now trusted in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were many cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, who tells her that it is to the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
So it was based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports that when you have doubts and could get a serious illness, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which occurs with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, will be taken into account.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than one month in the United Kingdom was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been proved that no doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode so proved to us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the identification of HIV appeared on the market: tests of nucleic acid (TAN) that allowed direct recognition in donor blood of the presence of the virus and not of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, since the person contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is thus significantly reduced.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of countering AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood infected with HIV.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years to meet a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion.
I think that today you can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health, says the Head of the Hema-Québec Directorate.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will come out of the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the Réunion Island that, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient resources in addition to having safe resources," continues Dr. Décary.
"Necessity increases because the population is ageing.
Being the cure against the most aggressive cancer, patients often need a contribution of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences on the number of donors that on average account for only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants are eligible as donors."
However, all healthy people who are 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people offering themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where the latter is disseminated, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Poor cases are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold it and encourage it to become regular donors.
Today's life is so frenzy that it's difficult to give blood an hour," said deplored Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, of which bone transplants, heart valves eyeballs and skin that are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited with Hema-Québec, which manages the only public bank of ombelic cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbelic cord, which once was considered a biomedical waste, there is plenty of blood rich in stem cells that can help cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we expect to take more than a thousand each year.
It should begin with proposals for transplanters at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of taking cord blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that you cannot have access," because Hema-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all Québec hospitals.
Calcium - L'Impact in semifinale
The Impact Montreal has qualified for the semifinal of the A series eliminations, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second final quarter final, at the Saputo Stadium.
The central camper Antonio Ribeiro, marked the decisive goal of the 90's.
After a first time without a goal from both sides, David Texto and Rocco Placentino signed up the following networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
We remember that at the first round of the march-return on Friday, the Impact suffered a defeat of 2-1 at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in the semifinal.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunderler completed a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still take part in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed by day.
In brief - Decisive network of Kovalev
The Canadians and their axes are ready to start the season.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive game phase by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, made two steps, and collected a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
Determined for victory the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned the Russians.
I need another game to feel at ease."
"He tried to hunt in the first period, he noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation."
Charest Point North
The Prime Minister shall not exclude the opening of the elections before the end of the year.
In conclusion with the general advice of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest took place yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tried to elect himself during the partial elections today.
"Enlarge the borders of our last great northern border": this long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday to Levis, by means of instruments of strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, was the projection of a kind of "Mulina to images".
On three Maxi screens, they were confused by the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric digs, mining cultivations, pictures of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means like full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the opening of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "Nordic Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on manpower, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening of the North- northern territory at the 49th parallel was never the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has been limited to explaining why the North would be "a joy from the enormous potential", but he has not spoken of timings or investment quotas, nor has he explained what specific priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
More and more, it has been limited to commenting on what it considers to be a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
Standing on the charest-style list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "great territory the double of France", is here, is Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is embedded in us," he insisted, as he would like to urge a myth of national founder.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the February of gold in Abitib, the National Engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense picture behind his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the prime minister during the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
After all," considering climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North," he said, talking about the transition from the northwest, which will be opened all year round due to the dissolution of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers the occupation of the territory to be a duty."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former PQ Member of Ungava), have already opened the way for the consultation of thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) took on an important role, started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also be based on the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be concerted, ordered and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the early Liberal ministers who had preceded it.
"Like the previous liberals, we know how to distinguish ourselves to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted is to revitalise the Beauharnois Central in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of the Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of Baia James, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he used another reference, conservative this time, the program "Road to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the project on the hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stated that its implementation would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his militants, raising applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said that in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not have the opportunity to start a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It underlines that it is certainly very busy, particularly in a federal council mission in China and at the Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chapter with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" which were smooth as oil: the PLQ demands, above all, recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will be appointed by the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
As regards the opposition, the rejection of the Northern Plan was accepted in a sceptical way.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has dissolved the Quebec Northern Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its application.
If you had," we would have made progress today," Marois commented alongside the candidate of Jean-Talon (the poll today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has said to support the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
"What we hope for is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," said Sébastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, in return for the holidays today.
Letter - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (lrony of luck) of the Harper cabinet, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "glory" for Canada.
This is how a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not repatriated a citizen detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple teenager at the time the alleged facts occurred.
The only government that, despite the signing of the Geneva Convention, has renounced its word and lets a child-soldier march under inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the defendant's guilt.
We recall, for information purposes, that UNICEF, Amnesty international and the Order of Canadian lawyers, in particular, invoke the return of Omar Khadaf to be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is exactly the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it doesn't matter very much that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of overcrowding.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", saying that Harper does not stop talking and that it sounds so foolish on his lips.
We arrived at a time when there is no morals anymore: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today's minority (to see what will happen after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the virtue, respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
This is where the shame, Mr. Toews, in giving up on all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech of the Barrick Gold
In the September 17th edition, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest aurifera company has sportsed a six-million defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small square editorial house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a demand for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for the Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who would support a position contrary to his own.
Little matters the outcome of the process, writers and editors of the book Canada Black will have to spend a sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with heavily learned weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the pockets practically without the funds of the mining company.
In addition, in these fights against learned weapons, tactics are often that of ruining the agreement in order to impose a consensus-based regulation that would impose opposition on anyone and anyone who would have to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it would be in front of the public opinion that he should have presented his own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where the Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates usually take place with the exchange of views and not with the impact of manipulative.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open up its books, documents and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent researchers teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in the public opinion and misdirects the petitions and letters to support the authors of Canada's Black.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public debate" when his contempt for the same public is clearly evident?
In the world of the vice president, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the perfumed lawyers and not the entire Canadians; this is a rather narrow vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denominators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Black does so primarily because he rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of siege (by seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold just gave the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Apart from Garver's surreal speech, the sport from Barrack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of the truth, essential in every democratic society.
It firmly rejects the right to quote authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country such as Canada it is impossible to study and discuss issues that are awkward to the richest companies in the world, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards as the authors of Canada Black do.

For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures taken by Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek at all a transparent debate.
This is going to escape from the university world, just as there is the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments are taking measures to limit the abuses.
Operation - salvation for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the heads of Congress, representatives of the republican and democratic segregation, finally reached agreement yesterday on the largest rescue-finance plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new US$700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by the two Houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: verifications of its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the repayment of public money, new provisions to contain the number of homes paid for missing payments, as well as an inspection fee paid to the managers of the protected companies.
The American Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative republican at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis at Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, unappreciable discomforts and disturbances would have turned on the everyday life of the Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Later on, the two candidates for the US Presidency proved to be rather favourable to the agreement, without however avoiding expressing their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the agreement, in particular that which will enable the owners to maintain their own home and that which is inherent in the remuneration for the heads of undertakings covered by the State.
"When contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice over.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"As I read it, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to re-acquire, with taxpayers' money, the risk- and inventible assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that led to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (loans) , and then to extend to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and to spill into the freezing of liquidity and the disposal of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge to send the first draft of an agreement, last week.
It seems to have been out of that blind neighborhood since the democrats accepted that the active "toxic" of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone at Congress, a provision has been added that, if the government had to face losses over the five years due to this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which 100 billion more can be added if the President rejects it.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for his aid, Washington will receive shares in the protected companies that will pay its dividends in the event of profit and that will be able to repay when the waters are calmed.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the possibility to delay the mortgage procedures for real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and starting allowances paid to the directors of the companies involved.
From today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that the way to their plan will be set free.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the republican and democratic segregation.
"Of course Washington doesn't hear you," said Republik Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it's not safe to take advantage of the taxpayers.
Leader of a small group at Congress called the "Caucus des Sceptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent professors of economy, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again the proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas reported that it would have renounced the purchase of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) for the crisis of real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the 10 largest insurers.
"It's not about the lost money, Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos said yesterday.
On the other hand, there is influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It's certainly something that saving men and families appreciate now that the times are uncertain."
During this period, beyond Manica, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalizing another bank in the bank for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would charge all of the loans currently under way at Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalisation by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty from the blue eyes was his axis in the sleeve for a long time, for others his weak point.
Did you get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the amalgamatory smile?
Yes, and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful devotees to true sacred monsters.
What a constant!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, after lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental of Brando, which he looked like and of which he was long a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 by German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots will be one of the glorious visions of the American dream.
A humble ego, last quality mark.
As he recognized all of the safe-made man's country, the Pacific war fighter, was proud of the fight, which at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, he later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television and soon at the cinema.
The same man for civil rights militant was also the car driver who ranked according to Mans's 24 hours in 1979, as well as six symbols, although part of a couple model since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
If you go with him the shadow zones of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to show-business scandals, of which you will never be able to fully reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart-to-heart throttle for movies, while his great characters popularize the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is re-proposed through its interpretations.
They confused themselves with the fascinating cowboy-boy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy unable to desire the focused wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La cat on the roof that was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we recall this in the text of the sensitive Mr Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep as promised.
A lot of other Paul Newmans have gone through history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Lassù someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean and was arrested after his death, who officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice naughty in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best movie in 1973.
Black and vengeful billiard player in Los Spaccone, great film by Robert Rossen (1961), Martin Scorsese's money color, which was the only Oscar on 9 nominations in 1987.
That face over the years was his.
Even him.
The epochs take place through its path.
Young people especially know him for the Slap Shot-Calpo dry cult of George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on little orthodox ice.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, brothers Coen.
The circle had been closed with a last role as patron of the Irish mafia in my father's era in 2003.
Unlike the most legendary grades of cinema that soon left the trade, Newman will stay long in the halls, reporting Hollywood throughout his life, holidays and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined it, with a point of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging you to exceed your performance.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like a bird from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of emmarginate to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholized carotid or desperate, of which he expressed disillusionment and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, bright sensitivity.
The first time that Jennifer was in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with the wife Joanne Woodward in the role of protagonist, was drawing a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost Scott's son for an overdose, dedicated him in 1984 to the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad movie.
Among the countless tributes showered yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old weapon companion Robert Redford (they had read together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great features of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a Protestant of the Hollywood derivative, is released.
We'll have scarred his face to spit on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging him as a bad taste, even though he was born as a gag.
However, the proceeds of those sales were intended for its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of admiring his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that he said "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
It was a privilege."
And it was as privileged for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & partners?
In the meantime, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in the context of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Search, the money obtained from competition bands was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the carrying out of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million flowers, is partly finished in the banks of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have taken the money obtained from tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled the obligations assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do so, invoice blocks were purchased on the Józsefváros market, and circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among others during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for consumption, on the model of these, the invoices to be forwarded to the competition bands, among others, those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Much of this is the work of István Lados and András, who, according to our information, has prepared, above all, the reports necessary to obtain funding.
One of Lados's "study trip" choices was a beer shop.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But so many people, as the restaurant says, would not all come together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, hereinafter referred to as Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, is a form of error and content.
One bed of Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, but the invoice included 130 guests.
But the publishers of the fantasy invoices exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., this also deals with restoration, in which accounting - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - was not even the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövârt and Hoppá.
Gy.z. Farkas, the company's manager, told Hvg.hu that when he was summoned to search and showed him the invoices, he realized that they were false documents.
"On the seal the name and the Iva game of our company were in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons, he did not even return the fact that according to the invoice, hundreds of people were accommodated, when there were eleven rooms in total and there were not so many beds.
By the way, the bill was from the restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in operation for a long time.
The so-called bill collectors did not worry to inform themselves that the Budapest Travel Agency of their choice, organizing only travel abroad, so they foolishly pointed to the invoice with payment in cash travels in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's billing practice.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also on the invoice, while VAT is exempt from travel activities to countries outside the European Union.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövōért Foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it was necessary to apply VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on invoices, as well as the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the invoice produced was written by hand.
In addition, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of an undertaking, they have indicated as the activity carried out on the road transport of goods, as shown by the proceedings of the Prosecutor, activities which were not carried out by the company originally based on investment advice.
Also for formal defects - cause of non-conform invoice format, false stamp - it has been found that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same has happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, that is why, according to our information, he refused to issue that invoice.
They've made invoices consciously.
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapitvány Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Szocialisták for the Együtt Foundation at Harmadik Évezredért of nearly 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of the Colllab Kft. to issue fictional invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and partners also the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million flowers at the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület association and the Vörösfeny association Egyesület, which did not have a real economic activity.
Not even the movement of money because the invoices prepared were then destroyed, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing invoices belongs to those who are related to the defendants.
e.g. Ivan Kubatov, authorized to take charge of the Director General of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not detectable there, which deals with trade in fuel and vehicles.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 concerning the sale of computer equipment, for a value of about 18 million flowers.
According to the data of the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The Director-General of this company was a Romanian who, between 2002 and 2005, Ivan Kubatov would have forwarded the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlas, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the competitor was taken from him.
On an express request from Ivan Kubatov Romanian walls have founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they did not receive employment.
The companies have however become useful because, at the request of the co-worker Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the Zuschlag associations: Atlasz and Y-Generácción.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov have issued to the various institutions 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million flowers.
The investigation considers that Kubatov has invested 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices, as well as the VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional invoices, made for the Biztos Pont competition band.
Y-Generation and Sjövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a band for the socialist utility agency Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They have also won 500,000 head flowers but the sums have not been used for the purposes indicated in the band.
To prevent this from happening, they presented to the TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of Arpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done, will probably refer to the progress in the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing might be if the number one defendant, János Zuschlag, would decide to lift the veil over everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even if he has promised to talk about everything in an extensive way, he has not yet done so.
We need to see whether it is in his interest, and it could also be that the Socialists have taken agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for 50 million flowers, much of the damage - would be willing to do the scapegoat.
For the time being, Züschlag could also have been offended to see that his requests for relief of his prison conditions, namely the granting of house arrests, have not yet been heard.
While authors of non-reparable commercial offences and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of excessive bidding: why spend more money?
At the auctions, buyers are willing to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
Researchers neurologists and economists at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published on Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a race such as eBay auction, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
The research has tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "party" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the cortex stretched under the brain enter into force intensively when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "autogratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise in the price is explained by scanning the actual reaction of the stretched body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial investigation.
In this investigation, three groups have tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported the actual value of the product concerned and made them their point.
To another group, they promised that in the event of a win, they would receive another $15 prize.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost money in the event of a loss to the auction.
The difference between the two groups was the fact that for one of them the win was highlighted, while for the other the loss.
Testing the hypothesis of neurologists the members of the group who played "against loss" were willing to make higher points than the control group or "win".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena encountered in auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we came to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schutter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when do you talk to your doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but chronic liver diseases are mentioned in Hungary among the first causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients increases to 100 thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical are hepatitis and heresy, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For those travelling it is useful to immunize against virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After forming yellow spots on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and dark urine, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year all over the world for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason, according to estimates, is that only one person in ten receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it may cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumours.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because the pathogens subtly destroy the liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and conduct regular medical analyses.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, the drug addicts and the tattoos.
In today's world, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Because even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease is worth addressing the family physician when any symptoms of unknown origin are noted.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so it stops the infectious power and can prevent the formation of tumors.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, first organized in 2004 worldwide by disease associations.
The aim is to draw attention to the chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith works as an analgesic species that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, British Telegraph reported.
In the context of a rather strange investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and at the same time atheists, while all those who observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling the pain.
The test is the first of a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also participate.
The test took place exactly this way: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the Emmelino by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a sort of religious state among the believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because it was not too different from the other and they thought it was a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time period they received 20 electroshock in four consecutive series, while observing either the painting on a religious theme or the other.
The Catholics have reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone would take care of" them and "they were calm and were overcome by peace".
Looking at the image on a religious basis, they accounted for 12% less pain than they had before Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image from the strong effect even for atheists, but you need to find the appropriate image.
"We need to look for an image to which they nurture very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of his research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains if the painting of a lady of Leonardo or another painter of such a caliber is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on the control of the pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the day of the tenth anniversary Google can claim to be both in people's pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their vacations, what an outpatient they attend and what interest them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors is not enough.
What concerns skeptics who compare with the Orwellian incubator, they do not actually see the web 2.0 substance.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as many personal data as possible from its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders that was: "we put all the information in a system of the world!".
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still beginning to manage all the information.
On the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: would he like to know if Google could answer questions like "what am I doing tomorrow?" or "what would the job be appropriate for me?", but the software doesn't answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough of the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the exact words they search for are recorded during their Internet searches, from which IP addresses are searched and from which page the interested ones stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can remember their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched for and clicked on, and they will eventually generate much better results; on this same logic it is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I care about? - the concerned users ask themselves about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of the Internet users are caused by the fear shown for the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire for freedom or even for the rebellion of power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of the internet users.
The most outstanding example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google has provided the Brazilian government with information that has made it possible to identify pedophiles from the page of the community Orkut maintained by Google.
On the other hand, Internet users concerned with personal rights have been relieved in May when the company - according to the EFF's electronic legal protection association - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: it cannot then be forced to Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully removed almost 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search expressions obtained in relation to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act approved years ago, but it has not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the full list of web pages and keywords worth two months.)
Therefore, Google's judgment is rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data spread Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and private life by starting to use the services and rising up with the rebellion that looks forward to the multinationals who look at the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", contrary to their rival, Microsoft liquidated as the world's conqueror because of Windows, because they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for their services, the source code kept always updated and the software package is much more accessible, youthful and cool of the official practice of the software crash.
But it can also happen because the geeks see exactly the problem relationship between personal rights and the Internet, which implies one of the key words most often repeated in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, leaving intentionally traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: show ourselves.
A young media can create profiles in several community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists your musical tastes, all of which can be inserted into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which their most recent photo galleries appear automatically stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read a number of examples from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common circle of friends, can easily find out who spent the night with her perfect boy or a company can license an employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is safe, the concept of private life now has been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make it possible to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Who wants to hide something or just avoid Google's monopoly can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time not leaving any trace).
There are few people who do not register on community pages to not be found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can replace with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best existing profile.
The public opinion doesn't even wait so secretly for Google to pull out the articles.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten advertising agencies' inputs, the services introduced at record time cause not only serious problems to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, critical observers in addition to all this find alarming points: the company summit, for example, has completely rejected the employees' protest after having doubled the right of corporate asylum, has considered it too expensive to repeat the daily restoration to the satisfaction of employees, but this all diminishes in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google has chained the head of the Chinese government and, according to their agreement, the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to publish a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, but one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the Google book and magazine scanning project will take on such proportions that the company will soon be faced with the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create a health profile with our references, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic base can offer good material to the next generation of fantasy writers, the Scroogel story of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google's data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped Ózd's double murder make the tracks go away
The police asked two minors about the double murder of Ózd, who were suspected of having helped to clear the tracks of the crime - the spokesman for the Police Question of the Borsod region said Tuesday.
Young people have admitted to their crime, they are currently accused of favor.
The two minors, two girls according to the information provided by the ILO, defend themselves free on foot.
The favour is punishable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man of the post, was detained on Sunday in preventive custody.
He's suspected of premeditated murder committed for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 20-year-old had a large debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle the debt, so on Wednesday last night he lured his creditor into an Ózd building where he and his 9-year-old daughter were killed.
According to ITI, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that intends to sell in the course of a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the offer of Poles represents the highest ever advanced figure for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press until now they have presented an offer to the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Finance Patria with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Sporijtelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has taken place thanks to the American President - he accuses La Repubblica - who has not been able to compact his party after a fast-paced law, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second 11 September.
A part of Madrid's press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El World, the lack of American political leadership has cast the world economy on the edge of the cheap.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and will then be experienced by the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress vote, there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the major transformation of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to leave the threat - note the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Some States today can still offer a lifeline to the boating financial institutions and taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as a domino effect, then neither the financial resources nor new solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary that the Member States of the European Union overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the financial markets.
Only on Monday did the weak financial institutions get more than EUR 100 billion - he recalls the Vienna Der Standard, which appears to be increasingly realistic the concerns that European taxpayers, like those of the Americans, will have to put their hands on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
So far, the EU has not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "salvators" must not immediately deplete the 100 billion euros, however it would be better to determine where taxpayers' money should be used to prevent further damage.
The Smart Machine Imitates the Flight of Calabron
What could be the best way to develop anti-inflammatory technologies if you do not imitate the sensors of the obstacles that are in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the amazing project presented to the CEATEC in Japan, the calabrons gave the initial strategic tip to the engineers Nissan on how to build the next generation of antillition systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotized mine with the properties of bees, with the goal of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying the bees form their own oval personal space that looks really much like our protective shield - it explained to Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development.
Important is the role of the ape view, capable of a 300 degree visual in each direction.
The engineers have focused on the idea of telemetric laser to copy the function of the monkey view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles up to two metres away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the monkey, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the incident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, is carried out in an instinctive manner.
"If it weren't for that, the auto robot wouldn't react quickly to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in an eyeball.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go up or down or in diagonal, it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of wheel steering.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and with high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than those to lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store data.
This robot must produce some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the previous maneuver data, so it only uses a memory of a few decades of Kb.
There's no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, they predict to Nissan, can be installed on serial vehicles within 10 years.
Further application options can be represented by the unification with GPS satellite navigation system which, by avoiding obstacles present on the road, leads to destination.
They also found the name of the expensive child
The written version of the Economic Savings Act of 700 billion dollars for the purchase of disproportionate loans has been drafted, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step half of the sum is spent.
In the new protracted agreements up to midnight Saturday, according to the time of the Eastern Coast, Congress leaders decided the $700 billion rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have done some serious steps forward - Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American House of Representatives, said that it was only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Minister of the Treasury Henry Paulson, speaking of the result of the compromise, said: the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street but about investing in the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 p.m. in Washington (on Monday 2 p.m. in Central Europe), but it did not make much money.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft economic stabilization law of 2008 concerning the programme, then on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to the Pelosi on Saturday night, and then welcomed the White House with joy the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made this evening and we highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesperson of the White House.
The programme, however, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which provided that the $700 billion would have been all spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate loans.
Now as a first step you will be able to spend up to half the sum of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the Congress's vote Monday, with these the Treasury Ministry will purchase securities with disproportionate loans on its back, the remaining $100 billion will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the programme to which the President of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The cost of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Ministry of the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can buy at the same time loans, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "accrued" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced the ministry's competent.
The rule of law makes it possible for companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Treasury guarantees the means of concern for which companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said that the law provides the means necessary to get $700 billion for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which is about buying the wrong funds, or insurance them, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the law just signed - it added.
Bank directors in crisis and waiting for state aid think that the government will limit their well-being, defined by the ultra-ocean slang simply as gold parachutes.
Payment restrictions will only take place in some cases, and the limitations will depend on how the Ministry of the Treasury will provide assistance.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys in the course of an auction, it will impose a surplus on the gold parachute, if they do not send the manager of the deceased bank in retirement.
At the time of the direct purchase of the disproportionate appropriations, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not overrun.
In addition, the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of the general administrators - the Democratic Barney Frank Chairman of the Committee responsible for the Financial Services of the House of Representatives has commented on the provision.
In addition to this, the State has the right to appropriate a share of the participating banks in the programme, reducing the risk of contributors, as they can ultimately also benefit us if the economy, together with the bank saved, will be restored.
The proposal for a law includes that in the next five years the President must submit to Congress a proposal that has to be able to repay the expected losses from the financial sector to the taxpayers.
Of course, both sides were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend the taxpayers' dollars - they have said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same ones who are responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - informs the Central Institute of Hungarian Statistics.

As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, the industrial costs of production were higher than 0.7% compared to the previous month and 3.2% compared to one year ago.
The prices of domestic industrial sales in the previous month are only increased by 0.1%.
The prices of domestic sales in the labour sector have also risen to a minimum of 0.1%, compared to July.
The increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and footwear processing sector (2.8%), especially in bags and belts with 4.6% and in the production of shoes with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price of plastic and chemical raw materials has led to a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemicals and products sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum in wood processing (0.1%)
Prices of paper production, editorial and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, there has been an increase in prices between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose by 0.3% in August in industrial domestic sales, firstly as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared to 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the manufacturing industries, the higher increases in the oil product processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metal products, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco representing a determinant weight.
A decrease in prices has occurred in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the manufacturing of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).

The Hungarian flower in the course of one month was weak compared to the euro of 1.7%, compared to the dollar of 7.1%, compared with August 2007, it increased by 7.5% compared to the euro and 15.9% compared to the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a vision?
King Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12th the US-Hungarian visa-exempt agreement may enter into force - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the post.
According to her opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the electronic system of entry and control is built in time".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be entry permits, but before departure tourists will have to register.
The responsible for Hungarian diplomacy will continue the negotiations in Washington from now on.
He will meet with the Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will deliver the medal of the Order Cross of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers from democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also joined in favor of the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, guaranteed their support for the $700 billion government plan for bank rescue on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Representatives of the Congress and the Administration after the long-term marathon negotiations announced Sunday night that they had reached a principle agreement on the bank rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market release package have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the introduction of economic issues Obama has regained some advantage, while the advantage of McCain, obtained after the republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin as Vice-President, has spread.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress would soon approve the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those steps of consumer protection that have also been supported by him.
"Now we have to act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
It has not been let out of defining McCain's economic ideas.
McCain explained in an interview with the ABC that "all those who are going to send down this situation with difficulty (...) but doing nothing is not a road".
The Senator of the Republic stated that the proposal included the establishment of a monitoring committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good results of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no merit in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill already Monday.
Press release of the German-language world
The pole on the right is intact, only inside the pole voters have become more aware of cars - thus Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The mirror (e.g. mirror.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours his parents and analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politician, CSU's erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took over.
The Christian-socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday a process that was realized exactly ten years ago was completed: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was rushed to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the period mentioned by Stoiber.
This is because modernization is carried out in a consistent way in the region, which devours parents.
The sociologists had predicted it 40 years ago, but they have been wrong for a long time. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not be left without consequences on the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernization is a step in the direction of increasing opportunities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole on the right is intact, only inside the pole voters have become more aware, critical, and hosted.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the CSU has distanced itself from the classic bourgeois groups: free professionals, artisans, diplomats and graduates.
Support for the CSU has dropped below 40%.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative daily came "Who with?" In the article "The presidents of the parties are stuck in the issues of coalition" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
The SPÖ intends to deal with the ÖVP.
The EPP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been held, and now everything around the coalition is rolling; in the debate broadcast by the public TV the party leaders have just seen the cards.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed his wish to deal with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, as vice chancellor.
As he said, the Schüssel-Multererer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Manyer has responded cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not have happened if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
If your party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition it is still an open matter in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ has repeated that he is open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume our responsibility to rule" - Haider said.
Járóka: We must break the visual circle of poverty and segregation
Today in Paris the European Equal Opportunities Summit was launched, organised this year by France with the rotating presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party, Fidesz, in the message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the Congress, called attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and, in turn, the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla, responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, have opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the context of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP parliamentary group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the occupations, that the Roma are exasperated by the labour market in the first place because of their low education.
"Most young Roma do not have an average degree of study and as a result of elementary quality teaching only a illogical number of them can reach a higher degree of study".
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in the enjoyment of human rights.
Investing in Roma children's education can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member it is necessary to make these links more widely known between the Roma and the non- Roma.
The more a Roma start school, the more they are able to become a productive member of the labour market; the more income taxes and consumption are contributing to the nation's budget.
"The right to European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - Lívia Járóka stressed.
According to the honourable Member, the purpose and action of the European Union is to speed up the process of deregulating schools and therefore it is essential to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives correctly.
"The visual circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, it is necessary to give Roma children the opportunities granted by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens full of the future of Europe" - Járóka asked.
As part of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year, since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at national and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, you will decide the fate of the infected Huber-Beckstein couple.
Despite the serious electoral defeats that have not yet fallen, the discussion of personal matters at the top of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed for the time being.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in place, the question is until the mercy lasts.
Of the luck of the tandem who has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two very critical politicians have indicated in any case that they are not attacked with all the strengths of the chair.
They have thus tried to soften the angry writings of the parliamentary group and the basis that one day after the "Babarian tsunamis", they have assumed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber, then at the top of his career, the Christian-social union gets 60.7%, but now after the coup d'état against Stoiber, it has risen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria, which gives 18% of German GDP.
Nevertheless, the conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy always count, in future they will be forced in any way to collapse.
As the first signal of the reorganization within the party, the vice president and federal minister of Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the restricted exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Voters exhibiting right values for a possible government coalition in Monaco.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of the Liberi electors, that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude towards Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity to strike by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman without regard for the great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their strengths on stabilizing Beckstein in some way.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also have an active role, which has so far been in the shadow. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be a chancellor after the Bundestag elections set for September 2009 unless the CSU has played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment for the failure, the loss of the land of the CSU will not adversely affect the large Berlin coalition.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the social democratic crisis is still hard.
The SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is explained by the votes cast.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Even though the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) really hoped that Lukashenko, with the renewed presidential mandate for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections, would "give" some seats in Parliament to opposition representatives.
The ODS has thus abandoned a boycott previously evaluated.
Following the opposition's expectations, Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, requested a loan to reduce Russian natural gas imports more and more expensive and agreed to give Russians the gas pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz that are going through the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the Belarusian political situation considered anti-democratic.
It referred to a disengagement that the OSCE, assessing the electoral campaign, placed emphasis on positive movements and not on weaknesses, such as the ban on the submission of one third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's fast Monday report also criticised the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also ready for a small comparison with Moscow and continues to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - it has told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for opposition to the 2006 elections, it is desirable that it remains despite the fact that "power has been afraid to have even one opponent in a weightless Parliament".
The opposition does not provide for protesting actions for the results but rather tries to get voters to the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, and for distribution the local authorities have difficulty, but I also see that more and more people are supporting change, including among the elderly - Milinkevich said referring to the fact that not even the most officially helped quet, that of the pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime to be the main result of creating social security.
Because of the country's indebtedness and the increase in economic deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security "that remembers the grave silence" - says Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition policy, the Russian observers have judged the elections democratically.
Sergej Lebedev, President of the Independent States Community, told the Russian press agency RIA Newsti: "People believe not in words but in fact", so the lack of opposition is only the proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were rotating doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from now on, he's taking this new step against the furbets, against those who stamp and then he's going to have a coffee at the bar in working hours.
The new anti-fannulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services" the minister says.
"Now there is a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," notes Brunetta.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, assures the Secretary-General: "There has been a process shared by the workers and there has been the collaboration of all."
In other words, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and cornette.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the attendance for public employees' illness has decreased by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more people at work in one year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "the wage dynamics - explained by the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double over the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have gathered to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by acceding to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is flagging today, about the least absenteeism at work due to illness - he writes the consumer association - the people of the 'operating fans' are constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of employees of the right and productive public administration who have joined in declaring war on the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, there will be a challenge to the exclusion of additional economic treatments for dependent diseases due to service; the extension of the time-limits for the reparability of the sick worker, including the visits to the inspection, and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Work accidents, Naples: "Cross prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, the data in Inail confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths compared to homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents at Work, established on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic chronics of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention of work is," says the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Mutilated and Invalid Labour Association, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "lifelong appreciation for the constant association commitment to the prevention of workplaces, the protection of unfortunate workers, the assistance of victims' families and the awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, there has been an angry 'suffering', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, for their size, cause the cry of the media and the involvement of the public opinion, but the daily reality offers us dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics."
Napoleon does not hide that "there is no doubt also a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
It is particularly important to take the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness by young people who are exposed to the world of work.
It is necessary to keep a close eye on the phenomenon, not to delay the alarm on its social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
For his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "as the phenomenon of the white dead constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to bring an urgent end to them".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not remove the number of white deaths that are impressive however," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not, in fact, want this 'downside trend' to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention wakes up that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level, too little is done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - it has stressed Mercandelli - to increase controls and inspections, but also to make a stronger contribution to the training of workers, starting from the school world."
"An additional effort - it has added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, it requires a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that is a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation provided for victims of work" and the "assisting derivative to which the system has been pushing in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker back the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who get lucky should not depend on spontaneousism or occasional enlargement provided by the legislator."
Mp3 readers in charge, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for an extended period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
As regards the European Commission, in a communication published in Brussels, the Scientific Committee on Emergency and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today, draws attention to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health.
"From this scientific opinion - read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour per day holding the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who often use mobile music and high-level mobile phones can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - the responsible Ue continues - there is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is that we need to raise awareness of consumers and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and that they take the step of the new technology."
Brussels had asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - executive Ue concludes - confirm that there is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine, together with the Member States and stakeholders, what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about the hearing damage that may result from an excessive exposure to these sources of noise are growing.
It is possible to limit many of these damage by resorting to solutions such as reduction of levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to high volume (over 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limits for maximum permissible noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in these conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would be 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be taken.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which this morning settled in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the fighters are closed in March, the joint and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official ballot" of Campidoglio and his mayor Gianni Alemmanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all political, social and cultural ideas - it tends to emphasise German - it will have to provide proposals for a development idea in Rome, of which political decision-makers, who remain the Union and the municipal council, will then be able to take advantage of.
There is no overposition of roles but just the desire to have a place where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Germany replies: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics breaks down on the management of the newspaper and on the emergencies that sometimes occur.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a corrosion: it is absolutely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to rationalize and involve the best minds expressed by the Capital".
For Germany, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference drawing, not closed or immovable, to enable our city to make an authentic leap of level, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit to its future".
A future which, the mayor of Rome states, "will not only be limited to the present municipal borders but will look well beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to become independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions ruled the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
She wrote to a Miami lady on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big nose: he thinks he will win the highest charge of a nation he has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
They are actually attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not respond to the question of voters: will it be a good president? Then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a good break.
Even in this case, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A daily newspaper in Mississippi, in the South of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the polling room we know who will vote for the American patriot.
It emerges from a side of the U.S. mentality covered up to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll think about where to put the cruise, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama had to win, we'd leave America.
What has never been said before, which appears almost certainly to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the winning weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89% replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to football.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives, and Americans have not been forced to make suitcases.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak point.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to perform.
Use, the economic shift makes you feel about journalists too: in the newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the Internet, "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control as regards the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for US journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that has to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the general public means to do.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today the U.S. journalist.
You are on ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the journalism at national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses open a bar to the Internet, for many views such as the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn about has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it "makes something good" for their journalism.
The biggest crack in American journalism today is among those who run the newsrooms - the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure their reporters divide their values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this has to do with work security.
Executives who think they're losing their job around the age of 3 are 47% at the national level.
For the reporters' staff he's going to 30%.
That of "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", to take or leave it.
Directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can also make $10,000 a month, as well as pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: every day after the first year, even after the third to arrive at 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF ROMANIA, DANILO COPPOLA IS GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudou, decided to reject the case of the real estate owner Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-Bnl scale counterpath investigation.
In the course of the process, the last week, he obtained the dismissal from the housekeepers transformed into an obligation to reside in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the landlord could travel from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
However, according to the court, these movements (to which he gave the opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access to the evidence that accused him.
The Elects in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion bailout plan issued by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
We confirm yesterday's New York Times informing us that the current crisis is crushing the Republican Party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, especially strong in the Central and South States.
The soul, for the sake of that, which was probably made alive by the vote I said at the outset.
However, this is just an example of the changes, the major changes, which the current economic earthquake may predetermine or already fail: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps even here.
Both in use and in Europe the crisis seems to be an accelerator for phenomena in incubation for a long time that in the new climate are solidifying and finally coming to light.
The first of these is the update, the extraordinary relaunch, of the dual category of state sovereignty in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have, in fact, links with the outside world, but which, above all, see the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, largely involved.
What immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In other words, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the light proof is given by the European Union that divides as usual between the different interests and between the various state strategies cannot decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects intervention, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and, above all, funding: since when you get to the narrow are only the States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in six.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two non-permeable resources, in certain circumstances, of which no market or international organisation can possibly have a similar amount.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-national element is still in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a very closely linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had already entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we agreed with a statement that our future would instead have to make accounts to an increasing extent with those very little immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another on the earth but are nevertheless absolutely linked to a territory, a territory.
So whoever is to be sovereign, he certainly has many more cards than he is, to those who have trouble living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that presupposes a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for self-reliable leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, is so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And together something even deeper and in some disturbing sense: a discredit, an indifference, an image of inadequacies, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
It seems to be becoming more and more road, in vast areas of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far growing, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, having made their time and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in other words, feeds underground a branched but able movement of delimitation of the leading classes and traditional political assets, which manifests itself in the sudden "voices" of elections or in the sudden developments of the collective moods of these last and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaiera to the collapse of the Labour Consensus in Britain, the rebellion of the American congresses against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It is felt that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say to someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and thus to represent, what is not taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies today and that the economic crisis invigorates, increases, is potentially exacerbating.
In the face of all this, talking about a "mass rebellion" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The overcrowd to walk on the walls
Conquer the laws of gravity thanks to a super collar and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of various American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close to us.
With just 2.5 square centimeters of adhesive, the scholars managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Ekron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of those who use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of structured tubes as a spaghetti pile”, explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecko legs, covered by microscopic skin that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these rectangles and at the same time "is easily out of the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For the time being, I'm not superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented a microfibre-shaped adhesive as hair that self-cleans from dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juice
Attention to the pumpkin juice, to the orange and apple juice.
These drinks, especially in summer, are consumed because they are dissatisfied and rich in vitamins, if they are taken at the same time with some life-saving medicines, alter their absorption by amplifying or reducing their effectiveness, depending on the cases, with also serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of fruit juices are both packed and fresh associated with the taking of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, that since the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of pumping, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some safe drugs, cancelling the benefits and endangering patients' health.
The pumping juice had already been accused of being considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic the effects of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, angiolytics, antistaminic and neurological medicines.
POSSIBLE MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - The same Italian Medicines Agency had reported this fact in a leaflet two years ago by alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this combination and to be careful about what you drink if you are taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active principles inhibited by poppy and other juices.
This is where Michele Carruba, director of the Department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, called for: "These findings are usually reported immediately to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that eventually change the pharmaceutical information notes.
So always read the package leaflets that you are taking and if there is anything that is not clear, do not impress us but ask for clarifications to the doctor or pharmacist” the expert pointed out to Ansa.
The Nobel Prize of the Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neo-Kyennesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron was missing, Krugman had planned in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that was not very controversial and that had been breached by the economist for years, but that has now proved to be accurate.
“I am surprised and also a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron’s or Worldcom’s collapse disappeared from public attention”, Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist", but also a publicist with a "very aggressive, particularly critical style against the excessive libertarianism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by voluntary developers, with SUN Microsystem monitoring behind it, the new Open Office is shown to the large audience with various new features: the welcome screen and the magazine interface and less spartan, plus other more substantive ones such as the native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention is also placed to interoperability with the Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some specific features of some modules are interesting, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for e-mailing them, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphic processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to that English mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent at home or at work on request.
And if the theme of the free can be a train for spreading in the homes, it is precisely in business that the Open Office suite tries the big bet, already able to count on various projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there is also a lack of reality that offers an ideal training, counselling and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding Word; Calc video, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the Emulsion presentations of PowerPoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to get to 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the expected number.
Even Kohl is positive is the fourth doping case
New case of positivity to the last Tour de France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third ranking and winner of the best climber shirt.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26th year of Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third-generation Epoch, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those conducted in the last few weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counteranalysis confirms the positiveness in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will meet two years of canonical qualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive in the third generation era is the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordery, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26th Austrian was placed on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also awarding the shirt for a better climber.
IMMIGRATE: NEW YORK TIMES ARE YOU GONNA GO, IS ITALIA RAZISTA?
Italy "from the country of immigrants has only recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" accepted with rebuttal.
Is this turning Belpaese into a racist nation? How much is it in a long article the New York Times that devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "north paradise": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation of the Lega that restricts immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The trend is highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of car rentals up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the last Sunia survey, the tenant union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characters to exclude the whole range of young people from the right to study for the highest total cost that families of origin should support - explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that it is also a process of generalized growth for residents."
In most cases, rental offers then contain a number of violations: free, unregistered, canon-free, sub-rented.
For the Sunia there is a need for extraordinary measures that, through the revision of the tax levy, can alleviate prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, there are about 450 euros; for a single room there is a minimum of 650 (Bande Black area) at an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) at a maximum of 900 (in the Victoria area).
In Florence a bed cost on average 350/400 euro, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students focus in the areas near the University, there are 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It saves only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples there are 300/450 euros for a bed, one room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
At Bari there are 250/350 euros for a single bed, at least 350 for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities where rents to non-Community students, such as Perugia, are more frequent, there is finally an additional anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradise cinema, the cities cancel the historic halls
Historical cinema rooms close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographes what is happening in the large Italian urban centres but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalizing cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multisalts and the consequent death of the monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear unrelenting and unconquerable to us, but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
Often disappearing are historical places and memory loads," is like less a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions," notes the director of New Paradise Cinema, the film that twenty years ago makes to Tornator the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prix of Cannes jury, and that recounted the poetry of a provincial hall and nostalgia for a way to live the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the practitioners, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional-style cinemas have been closed, and to pay the largest bulkhead are the halls in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures was Emilia-Romagna with 82 persaly cinema, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exercise has developed irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures are built, but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all its participants are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of appropriations for the fund in favour of the operators: the state's early debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not comply with existing laws.
In order to support the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million would be used each year."
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned with closures, has decided to proceed to repairs with the signature of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical centre and on the outskirts.
Among the rules are tax relief measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for the stop and in some parking lots.
“It’s an initiative that I like” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true, however, that in contrast to the perplexity of the multi-ex rooms, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today the public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradise cinema", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I go to the Rialto or Quirinale by way of Nationale now closed, where I have lived with so many shared emotions, so that I don't see the dusted boxes I turn around from the other side.”
Link me between politics and illegal arrest mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to harmonise the choices of the municipality in the interests of the Pyromalli.
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the Antimony Directorate of Calabria address the mayor and vice-indicator of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested today for outside competition in Mafia association.
In Mannets also Joacino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer grandson, the boss's homonymist, already convicted for association to criminalize Mafia press, sentenced to EUR 10 million.
"In spite of any legal and moral norms, as well as in good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay counsel to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been so granted to the cosca - the judges write - to enter officially within the municipalities by facilitating the possibilities, already large, of control and direction of the public administration."
The president of the regional council of Calabres Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organised evil are many" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the dragon, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Pyromalli shell.
By the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been raised by the task of administering the Commune.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Udc's mayor at the time of the dissolution, was elected head of a central-right coalition, after the May 2006 round.
He yelled at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architectured everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the order of arrest signed today, explained that the Pyromalli Kosca had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pms, "the availability to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a larger group known to be close to the Pyromalli, uniforming the choices of public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When energy is born from the waves now come down in the field the big
It is an extinct deposit, which occupies more than 70% of the surface of the planet and is now being discovered by the large world energy companies.
Where, currents, tides are the new renewable sources that have put their eyes on, and now they try to put their hands, colloquial like the Chevron.
The possibility of getting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years now and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now environmentalist bodies and the new increase in oil are driving the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be met by offshore wind power systems.
This quantity would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides.
I know about the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and between these companies that have always voted on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - he has declared the spokesperson of a company associated with the U.S. oil spill at the Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and President Bush has recently launched a plan for new tribulations.
In addition to the Chevron there is the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the road of energy coming from the sea and the amounts invested so far, as not noted in the details, indicate an interest in rise according to observers.
Technology to develop.
Experts are still talking about a technology in the trees, even because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies must be used with greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a good system connected to each other.
The wave push, which moves the boobs up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders within the hummingbirds.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four plants of this kind under design, waiting only for federal approval and part of energy could serve as a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping centre and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides rotates the pitches of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, is currently worth the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves and is therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely about the energy of the seas that have been like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that look at costs, have already invested $7 and half dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
