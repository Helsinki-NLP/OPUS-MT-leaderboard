The great return of the Czech humour is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called to the NHL
Czech hockey player Pavel French, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to NHL.
Twenty-one-year-old pulsar will be at the middle of the day, and soon he could get to the branch.
The former brand name of Lithuania, Plzno or Russian Cheljabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He's been in the middle of a fight with Vegas and since then hasn't been present at the NHL clubs.
The incident occurred at a time when the experienced carpenter moved from one point to the other.
"Pavel French will be outside about three to four weeks with injuries in the lower part of the body," the whole of Denver announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL branch was finally extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time, he was called from a farm where he took four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, 94.5% of the operations were attributed.
The plzen hockey player wants to finally sit down and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had problems with his hips and in the short pandemic year, he didn't open up a single hit.
In the NHL, "Francík" captured 36 strikes, with a success rate of 92.3%.
Charles on Christmas wish to saturate Camille's rosary, William and Kate's pose in Jordan
The British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas wish.
He also published his wish Prince Charles, who used the photograph, on which his cousin Camille helped to plant the Russian.
On its website, the British BBC news station reported on this.
They send wishes to their friends, to their collaborators and to the institutions they cooperate with.
The photograph came out of nowhere in the desert.
The duke of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dress in khaki color and has princess Charlotte as well.
Prince William, the leader of Cambridge, is wearing the same thing as Prince George and Louis shorts and a shirt with a tie.
Whoever took the picture, William and Kate didn't take it, it's not even clear when exactly it came out.
Last year, the royal family for the photograph intended as a Christmas wish insisted on the package of straws in front of a pile of trees in its rural settlement in Norfolk County.
The image that serves as a Christmas wish was also published by the successor to the throne of Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught him in June at Ascot's achievements.
Charles, who has a cylindrical head and a face of a rose, is helping Camille put on her rose colourfully decorated with bright clothes.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbro a million per title, the Hardy denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the accused former vice president of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr had a promised million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season from Prague.
He informed the efotbal.cz server that he had reached part of the police records.
The president of the representation of the Jaroslav Tvrdík chief club said that the redwashers did not allow any corrupt conduct.
The server published a census of police interrogations, in which Slavie is mainly represented by her former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended last summer at the championship club.
A former influential red-haired officer was in frequent contact with Berbre, as well as with the former sports director of the then secondary town of Vyshegrad Roman Rogoz, who is also in the case among the accused.
Criminals allegedly worked with the information that Slavia Berbro promised her a financial reward when she got a title.
2019 team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police department has made it known that for the victory in the league, Roman (Berbr) from the officials of SK Slavia Praha has promised a million-dollar salary, quoted the server from the list.
The day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met with Nezmar not only, but also with the president of Slavie Türdík.
According to the server, there's no further evidence that the police are still dealing with this information.
The defendant refused any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017 we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered the opposite alternative to its development.
We have never allowed illegal negotiations, tried to influence decision-makers in breach of fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial implementation in this regard," said the Report List Claimant.
In the follow-up, among other things, Nezmar does not selectively offend some former Slavia dark-haired players, and he also insults his former head of the Hardy.
In mid-October, the alleged influence of the competitions by decision-makers broke down police intervention in several places, including the Prague FAČR.
The highest position in the affair is Berbr, which no longer appears in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director Vyšeradu Rogoz was released.
The helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
They will be new, but in principle worse type (the shooters must wear the cartridge and carry the cartridges manually without covering).
Car - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various tankers - on a proper level, besides, Prague V3S has already managed to get rid of the specialized units.
Aeroplanes: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - too small with short flow, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we don't have at all (but we manufacture and export abroad)
PVO: medium-sized, elderly; short reach - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have stories like that.
I've got a chase right next to the city.
There were nutrients coming out of the river and doing damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to be a brothel, so I sat still and the guy didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but of course the fox was gone in a moment.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot myself.
The poor fisherman almost screwed up, had a man on all sides, so I called him that he was on the list.
Before I got off the seat, it was a fuss.
And a man's face is a peach.
On the other hand, it's not a war that would have to be a coincidence of a lot of coincidence to happen, you'd probably be seeing in a thermovision that's almost everybody's got today.
So in the visible place, the expensive things are going to put your feet in the bag and you should be okay.
Voyette versus Hamaček.
Inside, breathers were significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The State responsible for the purchase and distribution of roaches, masks and respirators for the profession closest to kronavir has issued billions of crowns on their premises in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amount per breather varied by up to a hundred crowns.
Why were prices so dramatic?
Which authorities were doing business?
And why did others buy a ladder?
Lenka Kabrhel talks to the editor of the server iRozhlas Dominik Kubištova.
I weigh soldiers and armies (as if I'm not hit by memories of the ČSLA that passed through the older generations), but the Czech can't benefit from the obligatory war.
We don't even have large stocks of technology that can get training, we don't actually have modern technology, we don't have existing professionals, and modern technology is getting more and more complicated, so stockpiles are going to lose quickly in time.
To this modern conventional conflict, where one can plant it, they will play very fast, not time will be exercised again.
Finally, depositors/territorial defences have great importance for countries, such as Ukraine, where they lead the mass guerrilla, and it is also an express need for the fear of the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will take place only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the drink will already be irrelevant, and we do not have adequate geography.
We don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play like they should.
Then set up a situation that looks like a guy who doesn't hit the empty gate for 2 minutes back, runs into an attack by himself between 2 or even 3 Swiss and says, "Tvl and what do you think will happen now?"
Of course they choose him as the average taxpayer.
The situation with this sign of "conducting the Defender" is so terrible that I'm so surprised to see that our attacker was able to play a match player.
Woven fabrics of cotton, not carded or combed
Covid pandemic slows down, but experts do not expect any major return for the next few weeks.
The effort in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time and has reached the pandemic equation, as is well known, a new unknown: micron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the present-day ruling Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of action, the extent to which it helps to cure the disease or the post-infectional immunity obtained by prior treatment.
This week, however, there was also an unexpected phenomenon on the side of the plus: treatment option.
A new medicine, antiviroticum molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalisation of a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be complemented by paxlovid from Pfizer, which reported success of up to 85 percent of the results.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of extending the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronary pandemic, also raised the question of how the next administration is ready for the coming of the medicine.
As it has been said, the first to receive molnupiravir from Merck will be for foreign patients.
The company ended up on the belt as the first and because the medicine began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
In this research it is often noted that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
That's why the Eastern Europeans, and especially the Czechs, are used to saying, "How our tail has grown".
You'll do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people don't have any circumferences.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and choose sides like AfD.
They're afraid of canceling culture, saying this to the public means loss of work and media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the research, west good, east bad.
But find out exactly what people think.
It's only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both of which have a survey of more than 20%.
We even know that the objects are in Czech three and completely identical.
Identical for unit rotation, so soldiers don't have to learn where it is again, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
Saranda is that the sssr didn't want to have a nuclear head in its own territory, either because of the safety or the speed of the installation of heads due to a more Western position.
In those underground covers (there are two in each soap), only the heads were kept not all the rockets as they are called.
If it was necessary to install this weapon, a special unit came up and mounted it on some portable device.
Besides the museum soap, they're left in a desolating state.
At the second grade of elementary school, we had a Cighan partner, and we were with him for four years.
He was all right, he was making good jokes, often when he showed up too much, but it was our mascot.
He played with him every time, often he went along and wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he was going regularly, he was playing sports with us, he wasn't stealing candles, he wasn't stealing phones, he was walking clean clothes.
He even went to school in the wild, he was doing different monkeys, but he was fine, maybe never a dick.
In the eighth or ninth grade, relatives, gypsies entered the same year, other classes.
In short, they beat the teacher, often solved some police, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something to adverts (old things that I don't need, etc.) and I've been selling to the gypsies often, they always had money, they didn't try to pull me at the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, and the guy called in a month ago that he had already rewritten it.
I'm saying to myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone's white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as he behaves in a decent society (works, works, women don't fight, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he pulls his hand, he builds apartments and houses, he's just in trouble around himself, he's making trouble, he's kind of the color he's got, but I'm gonna care.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatic
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, unfortunately, despite the resurrection care, suffered her injury at the scene," said Law spokesperson for South-West health saviour Zuzana Fajtlová.
The accident probably blamed the driver who drove the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot brand probably went from the village of Zíchovec to the municipality of Bavorov and from undiscovered reasons he went in the opposite direction.
After the collision with Škodo Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended on the roof outside the car, describing the accident of the Yugoslav police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarz.
A young driver of Peugota suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
It was a lot of injuries and was locked in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute pre-infirmary care and was transported in a stable condition to the Chezkobudjejov hospital, as rescuer Fijtlová noted.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a slight chest injury and was transferred to the hospital.
For packages from outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide data
Lukas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's cutting his pick-up cards mostly.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars higher, where it still pays to import, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," the collector approaches.
Since October, his orders for small consignments have been slightly distorted, he has to re-attach VAT and return the data to the customs procedure.
He will receive an e-mail informing him that the customs are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it shall be sufficient to complete the data on the consignment and, if VAT has not included the trader already on sale, it shall be measured by the customs office from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide the customs procedure on his own, the total amount shall also be assigned to the carrier’s remuneration.
According to Lucas Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll call one or two intruders, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
It's mostly a five-minute question for me, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments can be delivered smoother.
Due to the new customs rules, the number of shipments received from abroad fell to the international post office in Prague from 60,000 to 15,000.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to the requests for data needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently there are 30,000 shipments in international mail that we have to process.
If people filled out all the data they need, and they would fill it in time, we'd be around half here, says Czech Post spokesman Matyaš Vitík.
Inflation solution
See the title, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think he should do to slow this growth down or make up for it?
We need to see in Poland a reduction of VAT on food and PHM, is this your way?
What do you think will happen that's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices grow faster than wages, I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I have been added 2% this year in bold, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the company that I operate in employment.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably the testimony of the rapists is sent on the grid for only six months?
This head just doesn't matter how the court can send a six-month-long animal like this to the grid just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships overall.
And it's not that the victim of rape never has to remember from that.
Isn't this a potential future report of victim rape?
A man from Hrobo "proaled" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrobo had been unwilling to help the officers to secure his countrywide seeking friend from Kostomlat, who was ordered to be arrested.
He called them on his own.
He went around it.
First, he called the cyclist and invented the story that he was stolen.
After the call to the press line, the guards arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "stolen" told them that he had made up his mind to get the guards to the scene.
In fact, he wanted only to advise the officers on how to give notice to the police in the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found that the woman was on the search list, in the state search, and an order was issued to arrest her.
This is why the PSC is addressing the case.
An honest question for people here, do you think our country is Slovak?
I am personally of the opinion that we have long been declared not ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree, of course, with the fact that Churchill failed to secure the release of Prague USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slovak language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe something without any evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not consider such a case to be a case of true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world if I don't, something like ten thousand different religions.
What god or god does a man have to choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one God who will torment you badly if you believe in another god.
But even in the wilderness there is no god but the LORD.
So in such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to hold faith in any god than to risk being wrong to choose one of those thousands of gods and that one true god whom I just didn't meet, send me to hell or somewhere like that?
Other: Voluntary training with the following classification in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per one) and under the supervision of professionals with practical experience.
If a person does well, he can get a professional offer.
All ACHR files would be fine.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say this: there is always a preference for cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies hunt in schools and there is some sort of divestment where the labour force migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only when we're growing up, but this process is going on all the time, every one of us is learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar penetrations should also operate between the civil and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany, or perhaps the Mongolian rider will never break up here.
It'll be funny to me how you think of NATO as something stuck in a rock, we've got allies, and they'll defend us if it comes to shit.
Well, you'll enjoy the pan.
There's just one election in the United States that's gonna blow up their budget and the whole NATO is going to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Polish have once again shown that they are enough to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long served as a guarantee of independence is an armed army and a population that can control military technology of its own time.
And today he can pilot remotely controlled means of every teenager, so it wouldn't be.
We don't need a border check, it's a far-reaching day, but a hired teen behind a remote-controlled device will be able to do it.
How not to drown in box Tsunami
You're packing presents under the Christmas tree and all of a sudden, you're stuck in a box and full?
This "waste" is used again by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
That's why a map of the shops that your used boxes welcome.
And it's not just Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like a one-time waste.
Anyone who can bring them to the store after agreement (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150) cartons, plastics or paper fillers.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overloaded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packages currently on the market that are lacking and also saved money, as the carton has saved 50 % in the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically thinking customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such company is TERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
However, the boxes and the filling material to us in Popovovek at Brno are carried by individuals who gather at home, and we are also called by the companies with which we have agreed regular transfers of the cartons.
We'll use everything to pack the shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together create a more thoughtful world.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to another generation, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only reception places for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take a sorted waste from home, where to deliver past medicines, tyres, earned electricity, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All wastes can end up in the right place, and in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
The overall map of the project already contains over 100,000 such places.
“It gradually includes collective courts, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity offices, SWAPs and other places that help to find uses for things that otherwise would become unnecessary waste”, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from Clean Czech Republic.
I think it's rather bad that today's technology is so simple and stupid that kids who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
The problem recently emerged (mainly in English articles) that high school students do not understand the principle of computers.
Because Google Photos or Apple apps on photos or actually mobile phones generally simply hide the underlying filesystem with files and everything is on one screen in the app.
It's okay to use the technique from childhood, but mostly to learn something.
Let's rewrite the stories, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU – starting in January – and it was huge.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he discovered the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they could not be reached in half a year.
French politicians like it that way, and voters like it.
Macron supporters of the right-to-left divide agree on a small but just in Europe.
And in France there will be a new election to the state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities itself.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe", and France is prepared to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately contributed to the criticism that Macron is about pro-European propaganda and is rewriting history.
In fact, he's trying to re-write history rather than defend it.
The very right-wing candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is now driving France with the fact that the regime from Vicha, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one storyteller seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are learning history as a story against them and never as a story at all.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs find out who won the battle.
But if they don't have a bright office, they won't know what was the broader context of the event.
The movie of the year is Quo you're running, Aida?
The Czech Mouse didn't win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also received awards for director and best actress Jasna Duričić.
This year's Karlovar festival was held at the first sightings of the playbead.
The best actor in Berlin became Anthony Hopkins for Father's film.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy/fit, and I'm not horrified.
It was like "to have a flu/to be sucked" for a couple of days I had a break and I didn't have the taste of smoking...
It was worse than normal flu.
I don't have a pass at the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying it's everybody's got it.)
Christmas Booktips
The Christmas binary, which will expire on 20 December, will contain a traditional literary annex.

Those who are left, and those who have left, know too little about themselves to spend their lives together.
Trains start to drive according to the new driving order, somewhere change carriers
From Sunday they start to drive trains on the train according to the new schedule.
The biggest change is the exchange of transporters on some tracks, for example between Ústí nad Lab and Kolin, where the place of Czech Drag starts driving RegioJet.
For most lines, only the time of departure will be adjusted, if any, mildly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the train.
The car sales started in the autumn.
The Czech routes plan to travel daily on average 6783 passenger transport connections, which will be on average 478 long trains a day.
Trains will be running around 118 million miles during a new flight.
Roads alongside national connections under the new driving order will also be to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new driving order, is installing dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will ride on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will take the carrier to North Moravia or to the western Czech Republic.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the fare of the driver from the next year, on average 3.2 per cent.
Roads take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the driving order of the region is the entry on line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymbürk – Kolín.
The carrier here, after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, will replace the Czech Roads.
Every day, RegioJet will be on the track to balance a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Further changes relate to the remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop from Sunday at Havlíčkov Brod stations, Žjár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express kept his 16 connections, two back connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakov.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlarík, the carrier was also trying to maintain the most similar driving times of his remote trains through planned exhausting work.
Without major changes, the operation of the trains of Arriva and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be exchanged in some regional routes.
The changes await traveling, for example, on the Českolipsk, where on the track from Mladé Boleslavi through the Czech Lip to Rumburk will be the place of Czech Drags to drive the trains Trilex German company Die Länderbahn.
Travelers will also be able to use the same drivers on the railway for the second year.
As with Czech Drags, their price increases by 3.2 per cent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the look of the other side?
We hear everywhere they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed, and how they had to drink, and how they died.
In my life, I haven't heard from the slave side or from the time nobody defends this, just judging.
No one will even tell you at school that blacks were often sold into slavery to blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school teaches you that colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they'll just tell you everywhere how brutal we Europeans have been killing each other, and they've killed each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, right in the schools, both in the north and in the south.
I didn't think anyone would deliberately shut up the facts, but I've heard it's happening before, and I don't think it's a problem, I don't deny it (perhaps in Japan the creatures from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was, history is not black and we tend to look at it today, without understanding.
History doesn't care about feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge things from that time on.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we are already in those southern states, yes, the confederacy flag and the famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, they had some good success and I found it absurd to reject them.
Plus, North wasn't much better than how many people are idealizing it today.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them in the South were slaves and many things opposed them.
I wouldn't compare this with Russia, they deliberately ignore some facts, lie and manipulate, and we don't have a look at them. (YT was also a video from the TV that released someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What happened to me at U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of Communism, something that their country never experienced.
In general, I found that at some universities it was shocking, those students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them in how many times.
And if I imagine these people will be much older once, it's a little bad that this might be the voice of the majority, because they're among the young and even in the ruling elite.
I think maybe feminism has long achieved what he had and is no longer about the same thing, has become radicalized.
At present, as feminists, they refer to those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological facts, as well as other groups such as LGBT and lead to radicalisation on the contrary, often leading to opposition even in quite reasonable matters.
And the more radical someone is, the more they hear him.
Anyway, I also didn't agree with someone judging me for colonialism or slavery.
I've met with a bad geography, but it was both sides :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Moreover, the concept of nationality is generally considered unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If anything with people is so interesting, world views and experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovenian.
The Slovene lighthouse is a very nice guy, he's got more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some cocotine about coronavir that everyone's ashamed of.
Then, of course, the Church of the Czechoslovak Husits is here.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born out of Catholic modernity and are actually Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to the services of the Husites, because it's theologically much similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on the street Botanic.
Otherwise the church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they make the Mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the Scouts took it from Austria
Bréclav – Plamínek blessed in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Shooting for him because of the coronary plague, but this time they didn't even go to Vienna, they took it from their Austrian colleagues in the morning at the border crossing of Reintal – Bréclav.
She was picked up at the border last year.
Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, and I look forward to it.
It's an honor for me to have been chosen, told the present journalists the Skull of Amálie Budíková.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly at the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Bréclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually for him, but the scouts drive the train to Vienna.
There's nothing going to change on the break-up of the flame after the Czech Republic.
With the Belgian light, they set out to take the traditional train first to Brno, where it was handed over to the diocese bishop of the Vatican Circle.
On Saturday, December 18, the next light break will take care of bullet couriers who will travel by selected speeds and personal trains.
They will take the light from them in the local bulkheads or volunteers who will then continue to spread the flames throughout the Czech Republic and where the trains do not drive.
Even this year, the shield must comply with the measures in force against the spread of coronavir.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the local events organizers to wear Russians, of course, try to follow the procedures, they were at least, they were not singing, they were just to behave as safe as possible, the speaker of the Belgian light Zuzana Hrbková described.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread together with the flame of the thought of peace, friendship and peace.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, shells and shells have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of insatiability and human interdependence.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basics of the economy that confirm that subsidies are economic cancer, but I don't think that funding as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education makes good use of the money, even though I do not understand why the money is put into agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned above, a surplus product is produced and consumed by the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work myself in a factory where millions of xy projects are funded/cofinanced by the xy project, and such a company is only artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is the acceleration of development when this company keeps up and picks up contracts/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its destruction
Total agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes the person who was born during the Internet time also gets caught up in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think the Internet ads don't move with me, but then I realize they influenced me too - it's just so blurry that you don't always get away with it.
For this reason, I also support the radical votes in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a complete ban on software (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, classic words - I'd ban the Internet.
I have a feeling of this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that most believe, and it makes sense, but I am not a sheep, but I will believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'm going to claim to be a critical thought"
2. "I will not believe everything they say to the media"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV's lost the trend of Christmas movies, their premiere this year has two hundred
Los Angeles – China, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, and this year more than two hundred showcases to their viewers in the premiere.
It was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has given way to and greatly enhances the visibility of the audience, which is why these images are produced as much as possible.
This year we filmed four times more Christmas movies than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database thus included only those images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in its name, so there will really be a lot more Christmas movies.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are stories related to this period in particular, worldwide there are popular pictures also at home, Love Heavenly or Classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful since 1946.
A real Christmas Boom, but it started until 2009, when the special movie series came, the American cable TV station Hallmark reminded the BBC server.
Her adventurous project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station has started its Christmas viewers loading on October 22nd and is presenting a total of 42 Christmas images.
Lifetime’s Competitive Station has 35 new Christmas movies this year, and they also contribute to the overall amount of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
“In this magical period of history, it’s important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that they snow,” said this genre Brandon Gray, author of the book on Christmas Films called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the spectators it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all the Christmas madness and madness of the world in which we have been living for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for his films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there will be about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which will, of course, be resolved and the two kiss.
That's how it's always been, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people are following each other, supplementing Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text on the cover-19, will not interfere with the final F1 race.
At the High Price Abu Kill in formula 1 will only take nineteen riders.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and she won't hit the last race of the season.
So stop Haas and send just one formula on the track.
In the last race of the season, he had to attack a better location of the 20th female who had qualified.
But Rus Nikita Mazepin from Haas Station will finally not hit Abu Kill at the Great Price.
He was positively tested for covid-19.
At the start of the race, only nineteen cars will appear, leaving the last track of Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who fights with Lewis Hamilton in the direct battle of the title.
Mazepin is, as Haas states, relatively well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita's physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and the guidelines of the competent public health authorities will be followed, and security will be the ultimate priority for all parties involved," said its representatives for formula1.com.
The Haas replacement driver won't be sent to the race, and he can't.
A prospective replacement would therefore have to graduate from the qualifications or rides in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 doesn't meet the first racer.
At the beginning of the just final season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year they were positively tested Sergio Pérez n. Lewis Hamilton.
They can lock you up for this, too.
And everyone will be stolen by the boss.
From the point of view of the law, the child is on the list of infectious diseases.
I mean, in the same group as HIV, the sea, the yellow or the typhoid.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive light is awesome!
It's kind of like a portable jewelery and the creator put half a year's work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, the lights never carried too much at home," admits Lebanon, who spent over 3,000 hours in the middle of the year.
Hedvábí bought in Italy, 24 carats of gold in France, and 2000 jewelry crystals were added by Swarovski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds to the light of moisture," the creator commends his work, which however does not recommend washing.
And there's another hook.
"I'm totally wrong, I have to sell the paper as soon as possible," Lebanon admits.
If it succeeds, it creates a world record.

The government approved sending up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, researchers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned area.
Poland has formally requested assistance from NATO, in connection with the ongoing events of the Belarusian regime, which in its territory call citizens of neighbouring countries with a false promise of easy crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already active in Polish territory.
The Omicron mutation spreads south of Moravia?
Hygiene's checking another case of Adam's baby.
“We are currently reporting further suspicions of this variant for another child from Adam, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the U.S. Adams is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases have been reported in the country during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Flu and Non-Hungary Resources of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the Director.
She added that it was two nurses from one of the college hospitals of Brno and two children of one of them, another two 11-year-old pupils of the U.S. Adams.
Between Brno and Adam's cases, there's no connection.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the Director, four unscathed symptoms.
No one suspected of Omicron abroad
None of these people lived abroad, nor did any of their families come into contact with anyone who lived abroad.
The relationship with the water champion is not in any of these, Ciupek said.
Paul Svrčinová’s chief hygienist said earlier that an international tour in the water field was being checked, which was in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were also players from the Republic of South Africa and one Belgian player was sick after his return.
California limits the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas for the ban on execution.
On Saturday, Governor California Gavin Newsom announced a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous American state by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against heart failure.
People would then be charged with damages to anyone who manufactures or sells firearms and firearms produced in California.
Newsoma responded to the fifth opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, which has allowed the Texas ban on abortion to take effect, although it goes against the almost 50-year-old pre-emptive verdict, which established the right to a flat-rate abortion throughout the U.S. approximately 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has now not decided on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, which made it impossible for the Texas Republicans to attack it on the usual judicial path.
"I am upset yesterday with the decision of the United States Supreme Court, which has allowed the maintenance of a tax ban on most waste services and has largely supported the Texas manoeuvre in order to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If States can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He entrusted his subordinates with working together with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice with measures that would enable the public representative to exert a ban on assault rifles and so-called spirit weapons.
This is defined as a sub-assembly of manufactured weapons which do not have serial numbers and which can be used for the handling of regulations.
Newsom wants to have the right to claim damages of at least $10,000 (over $220,000) and the costs of anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts of the "spirit weapon" or sets for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our way is to create a threat to private complaints, then we should do exactly that," said the California governor.
The AP agency points out that after decades California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June the federal judge here blocked the ban as a constitutional one.
Unless it is now effectively renewed by a ban on the use of the Texa template, the words of the liberal members of the Supreme Court of Sonii Sotomayor, who, in an inconsistent opinion, warned of the extension of this legal mechanism to other American states, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court did not recognise the Texa ban on executions in full immunity from judicial review and allowed the sentencing clinics to continue in appeals against the selected agents of the southern United States.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public test phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination scheme will look like, and it also comes to improving the vaccines itself, based on results.
Perhaps a large study of the effects of 4 doses has already been carried out in Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to five fold increases in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other expectant, he'll have his own improvisation scheme for the time being, it's just too soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should soon be placed on the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer’s specification, promises up to 10x greater efficacy.

How can I legally follow the League of Online Masters?

However, it does not include the UEFA Masters' League.
I think O2 is offering the League of Masters, but I don't want to change the providers of TV and the Internet.
Poland has threatened to stop payments in the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act against the law if it took advantage of the new powers and would stop Poland's payment of the money due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the withdrawal of EUR 36 billion from the EU fund for the recovery of the economy affected by the epidemics of cowardice-19.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to proceed and use a mechanism allowing for the withdrawal of EU subsidies by countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU veto expulsion in all matters requiring unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small party Solidarní Polska, without whose voices the current government would lose a close majority in the Seimas.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will ask Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable because the EU illegally opens up funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, to which the Polish Minister has added.
His party in accessing the EU is more radical than the ruling party in law and justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has made to Ziobrov's actions threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
Brussels states that "the conditions are impossible because their aim is not a state of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "a political dictatorship carried out by extortion and is trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of the EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucrats who are not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never join such concessions in Brussels, which would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland's status as a colony," he said.
But to be honest... in Lidla we have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, one yogurt I met again and again, I just needed cheese, parmazana, after ten minutes at the milk regals I gave up and I asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector, all of them were chosen, less common and special cheeses, but it was between a green and unlactose zone...
If there's a way out, I'm not going to go into any market anymore, no action, no action, gold bowls in the square, maybe they don't have that choice, but most of them have everything I need and it's got some order, so I'm ten minutes away.
I'll take my vacation to Lidla.
And I don't care.
For two years I've been watching it deal with data like manure, most of the opponents of the wait is just a little bit more off than most of the waiters.
The rational discussion, however, takes place at the expert level, but only extreme views are reached in the public space.
Always from the wall to the wall.
Binary thinking: waiting saves us, waiting them for nothing.
To ban everything, to allow everything.
Colorful cookies instead of robust analysis.

I was punished by a cook in my childhood.
It was never due to signs, most of it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry ( she read instead of going to bed, washed with her brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always threatened that if I did it once again, I would get hurt (at times even after the next "stamping" the cook only brought and laid so I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few stab wounds on my ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and in a measure) is beneficial because the child is reacting much more to them than to words.
I think it's important that part of the warning, because it gives the child his way of choosing whether or not to listen and get it, or whether it's going to get better and punishment won't be.
After all, I had only enough warning to start listening.
System protection
When a leading Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalistic question in 1999, what the Czech Constitution means to him, whether a sacred letter, which he swears and which he learns from at school, or an agreement which can be amended if necessary, was firmly attached to the first term.
We once agreed in the constitution on democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to save with the changes.
And imagine: Some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like rabbits with pork and beef, he voted this time on the question of Vojtich Cepl.
However, recent lawmakers have increasingly seen the need for changes in the Czech Constitution.
The years have been tested by situations that her creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, for example, by the conduct of the directly elected president.
But in one thing, Cepl was right.
All we know about such documents is that political intervention in their texts must be thought through.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be a key to manage most of the crises that companies face in the past.
The Constitution is, among other things, a rule of government consisting of the individual rules that govern politicians' maintenance of the games.
We fear that too much will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we link policies to bans.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in the U.N. Brno they fight for the life of a few months-old baby
Although coronation is known to be milder in children, there are also difficult cases where hospitals have been exposed mainly in recent years.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, it is 2 to 5 per cent compared to adults," said the New Primary Clinic of Child Anesthesia and Resurrection Faculty of Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Masaryk Petr Dominik.
The course is much simpler, easier, often without symptoms.
But there are children patients who have severe coronary disease, which we see especially in the last period," Dominic added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild support.
It's being played at the clinics of child infectious diseases.
Truly very seriously sick children with coronavir are at ARU until recently.
Children with postpartum syndrome have been in the doctor’s department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute care pneumonia, which means lung inflammation, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said and added that this disease affects adults as well as adolescents, as well as a few months of babies.
There are also children in severe conditions due to coronavir in hospitals.
"At present, we have a child of several months of age and adolescents," said the mayor.
However, he is pleased that at the FN Brno Children's Hospital, no child deaths have yet been recorded on the coronation virus.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominica, there is not only a part of the co-operation of a psychologist in the children's hospital – not just in the coronavir department.
At the same time, it also notes that both adults and children are expected to reduce the duration of the disease and at the same time reduce the incidence of post-cived syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the administration of the booster dose to children," the doctor added.
In a quiet area, you can only walk along the designated roads.
But those quiet areas aren't that big.
They are seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the peaceful zone you can walk anywhere (but don't cross the fence in the field).
Skiing/driving on wheels in the woods outside the marked roads is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not kept close to the national park).
How's the conductor?
Music goes in my head. Joseph Kurfirt laughs.
He was separated by a Liberian opera and originally played at the forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing practically every repertoire and as a conductor not only in the Liberian Theatre F. Šaldy, but perhaps also in Plzi, in the Theatre of Joseph Kayetán Tyla.
He cooperates with the castle philharmonic, film philharmonic, or the sub-chronic symphonic orchestra.
China builds the impression of a controlled plague and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis
Synologist Jirouš: China builds the impression of controlled infections and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis.
China has gone into medical and political offensives.
A few months ago Peking reflected criticism that he could not stop the plague that had turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increases in the infected.
States including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protection aids and Chinese doctors are helping a lot in the fight against coronavir, for example in the highest affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing's will?
Is it friendly support or is the Communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He's got a friend, and he says, "Don't you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's great.
The wife likes it because she saves the grass, she washes the car, the kids play with it.
It's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Dude, we're gonna cry, it's gonna be great.
After a while they meet, and the guy who bought them complains: are you guys who sold it for elephants??????
The lawn moaned, huge shit everywhere, the car sat down, the kids were afraid of him, and the wife wanted to get divorced.
What he's selling is, you're not talking about an elephant, so you're not selling an elephant.
World events are ruled by power.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, they are the powers that determine the course of the international event.
Europe can only become such a power if it works for its integration.
It still works at the level of economic and political (on selected issues), but still lacks military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century there'll be different moods and it'll take place.
I've also thought about it, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on honesty, so maybe I'm a linguist.
I'm just based on the fact that most of the ellipse includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins", when it is clear that it is both from Spain, which in the case of "Spanish fruit and mandarins" in the mandarins is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base it on the fact that the sentence sounds "all American forces" in other words, including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
So in other words, I expect it is already included in this broad concept and there is no further need to specify it among the American forces.
But again, perhaps I'm just a dictionaryist :D
Whether it's like that or not, it's a pointless requirement.
A five-degree earthquake was recorded in Tokyo.
Japan's Tokyo metro and the surrounding area hit the 5,0-degree earthquake on Sunday.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured a monkey cosman Milly
Scary pictures show the moment when the frightened monkey screamed in the toilet before her insensitive owner scared her and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkey also fed the parks, kebabs and burgers, regardless of their actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate's court in Gwenta has now for life banned the breeding of animals, reports The Sun.
Experts on the recovery of monkeys who are looking after Milly said they've never seen such a scared cosmonaut.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating with the Monkey World employees in Dorset and now plays again with another saved monkey named Moon.
The fourth mother admitted to two charges for causing unnecessary suffering to the protected animal.
In the case of a judicial court in Gwenta, she was sentenced to a 12-week sentence of deprivation of liberty with a conditional deferral for one year.
The Netherlands has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, has received a life ban on animal breeding and has to pay 12,000 crowns of judicial costs.
Leading the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the stolen animals, Steph Sawyer said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
Milly took a while before she got used to people again.
She screamed and hid from anyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her cry.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she sits down and is satisfied with the male, her gaze of new people can still cause panic.
Psychic scars from the extraction will drive her forever, says Sawyer.
Milly's shooting came out after the police in Guenta discovered some scary footage of a woman's phone after a break in her apartment for drug charges.
You can hear Milly vulgarly giving on the tapes.
The next video shows how the Dutch monkey offers cocaine and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, together with her partner Russell Cox (43), she admitted to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (in excess of 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months, and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts can you learn from that verse three times by jumping over the whole 20th century?
Like you're taking the same stuff in the first grade as in the sixth grade?
And they kill the whole idea of bifling, when no one, the honor of exceptions, cares whether you know or understand.
Write a test on 1 and then no one cares.
Go on and on the street at random people ask if to manage to determine the nature of the roots of the square equation and coefficients.
Everyone's been through this, and the absolute majority won't even get into it, and they're gonna tell you they're all in a coma.
So what the fuck is this about?
I'm a big fan of general overview and the reality is that people don't want and don't need.
And then it's unnecessary and you'll never get into them anyway.
It's taught in part for a lot of people who'll need the thing.
But like, the note that you don't really need all this to stand on the machine, I mean, seriously... because you just don't.
Plus, we're getting a little slow until we don't know it's a punch mark.
(To which our communist past and vilification against students and elites are likely to share) Of course, the price of becoming barbarians in these machines is simply high.
If journalists were to be able to count, the boy here probably never reached these dimensions.
First view wedding: War of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately," Andrea answered on the Instagram in Stories on all the questions of curious fans who disappointed her at Kadrim so that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrew, it's been written since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea was moving for her, at least until she got back to the Czech Republic.
But she totally refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did he not end with love, but he grew up to hate each other.
It was a planned attack from you! He disbanded Kadri's turn in response to Andre's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged honesty of Kadri's ex-wife no longer liked his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stop the brother publicly.
Normally, I don't say anything like that, and we've never said too much in our family.
I certainly don't want to cause any pity.
But if I see someone who's trying to hurt the public and dirty the name of someone I love so much, I just can't!
I'm sorry that I have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even though he was young.
I'm more sorry if I have to read such false information that are probably quite out of context.
I'd love to know Kadri as much as I, our close family, are in a confession in response to the words of Andrey.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and we know how it really was.
The drunk thief jumped down the facade to the fifth floor.
You don't believe why.
Cchao started his robbery at the parking lot in the residential district, where he tried to get into several cars.
According to the information available, he finally cut off from one vehicle in the recalculation of 330 non-total crowns.
Then he didn't think of anything better than sneaking into the 5th floor and entering the apartment.
He stole two bananas there.
One security camera is then captured, leaving the street from the crime scene and eating bananas.
When the owner woke up in the morning, he found out the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
The Cchaa then stopped.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on a criminal's day.
And because he needed money, he decided to run away in a drunken mood.
The whole thing is under investigation.
The drunk went down the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and efficacy related to pandemic emergency.
If it is cancelled, the law will not be effective.
The law, however, limits the scope of the business
Isn't that enough for you?
The right to gather will be limited, but never cancelled.
In Saturday's elections, four municipalities reached over 60 percent of the electorate
New representations of people elected in the municipalities of Komňa na Uherskradišk, Lužice na Mostecka, Nova Ves na Liberecka and Rovna na Pelhřimovska on Saturday.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law or the number of representatives elected here has fallen.
There were 99 candidates for the total of 28 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69, the youngest is 33.
Working out the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes relatively difficult but successful year.
There have been a total of four new or repeated elections to the general representations and, above all, very closely monitored elections to the House of Ambassadors, Vice-President Eva Krumpová said.
She recalled that because of the epidemic of covid-19, the elections were more demanding for equipment and personnel security.
In Komni, Uherkogradišk, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday election, which received 27.76 per cent of the votes and two mandates in the weekly representation.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 per cent of the votes, which also means winning two candidates.
Two seats were also given to the citizens of Komňa, and their vote was 18.52 percent.
Once again, the former mayor of Jan Krzyžková, who is a member of the Privates, was appointed as their representative.
For one candidate in representation, the Komnáne – independent candidates were reached.
There were 75.48 per cent of eligible voters in the polls.
In the municipality of Ravná na Pelhřimovska, the association Pro Ravná won.
There were 50.50 percent votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent Candidates 2 have joined the General Secretariat.
The vote was 93.62 per cent.
The repeated elections in Lužica in Mosteck have again won the Association of Lužice and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
There were 56.73 per cent of the votes and, as in 2018, there were four mandates in the weekly delegation.
The second ended the Oce candidate for the people who voted 43.27 per cent of the voters, and three representatives will be represented.
There were 76.7 percent of the volleyballs.
Elections in New All in Liberia won independent candidates Hope for New Ves before the U.N. Movement.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 per cent of the voters voted and thus obtained four seats in the weekly general representative.
The UN received 40.12 per cent vote and against the proper elections in 2018 increased, gained more and has three.
The vote was 42.9 percent of the voters.
On Monday, the elections will be held by the State Electoral Commission.
Then they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this people write to you.
You're just playing stupid to have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I don't claim that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was finally the goal to look good).
And I don't care who believes in it.
On the other hand, I wonder how many churches have had a lot of money in the Middle Ages, how much money they have accumulated, how much science has been undermining, etc.
Not all the wars she's caused, for example, the thirty years.
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and church don't have anything to do together
A man fell his head down from 12 meters.
The attack on concrete survived.
On Sunday night, a man in Ostrava survived an incredible fall, with the rescuers of the Regional Health Rescue Service.
Workers at the Regional Operations Centre took over an hour after Saturday afternoon a pressure call with initial information about the fall of a man from the height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and health personnel immediately arrived.
After arriving at the site, the doctors found that a 17 - year - old man had to fall out of a window about 20 feet [12 m] high and hit his head on a concrete!
In the Vítkovices, coal was caught.
But not the way you should, and the firefighters are going to the event.
At the time of the arrival of rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and a direct threat to his life.
The infected doctor intubated his breathing pathway, provided artificial lung ventilation, and, following further measures under pre-hospital emergency care, his ambulance was transported to another care of the Ostrava Traumatological Centre, informed the speaker of the ZZS MS region, Lukas Humpl.
I'm more concerned than with coronavir from inadequate public and government reactions.
The spread of coronavir in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, first of all the fight against infection, but it is mainly for doctors and health personnel.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David Czar.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the band
MMA experienced a wonderful gala evening full of interesting results.
The UFC 269 was doing things.
Outsider Julianna Penová was able to defeat the legendary winner of Amanda Nunes, who for seven years did not find the winner.
Charles Oliveira didn't pry into the light carriage, gave Dustin Poirier a great kick and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly threw Cody Garbrandt's technical CO in the first round.
He also beat his opponent Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought a woman's battle of banta weight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julian Penn.
The American entered into each other's battle as an imaginary "thorn", so Nunes did not lose seven years and brush his teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively, and the opponent even spared the push kick she sent to the country.
However, the money did not lead to any further error and failed to try to attack by hand again.
The second wheel was overwhelming and very tense for MMA fans.
Both rivals were honored with many excellent blows and hard hooks.
Plus, Nunes got her on the ground where she started scratching her.
She had to give up her efforts and pull off the attack.
The American made a huge shock when she became a new champion.
The gala evening summit was a battle between Charles Oliveiro and Dustin Poirier on the title in a light weight.
At first it was better for Poirier, but the card was gradually turning.
In the second, he tried to be more active, Oliveira, who tried to bite the duck by the hand.
He failed too much, but then he created a great deal of pressure, got a match on his back and put a series of wounds on him.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked shock, which Poirier at a time, but then he had to cut off the scratch.
The Brazilian defended the title. Poirier lost two years later.
In another match, the sovereign triumph of Sean O'Malley, who was in the first round, won Rauliana Paiva's right-wing back.
Then he received a series of precisely measured hits and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to talk to Cody Garbrandt.
In spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now seven years later she lost.
That bitch, or that bitch?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most of the main names in Czech are only one grammatical family, so it is not a problem for them to determine whether they are male, female or middle.
Then there is also a relatively large group of key names for which the family is not established.
Such fundamental names conflict between two kinds.
They then acquire two ends and, in some cases, remain in an indiscriminate form.
For example, the word “sweet” or “sweet” is a genus of male and female, in which the first one is inclined according to the pattern “machine”, in the second one according to the pattern “song”.
For other groups of key names, different shapes are already in the first case of a single number, namely: ‘line/line’, ‘kedluben/kedlubna’ or ‘trambor/trambor’ (meaning food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "cow" in Czech Republic and "cow" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similar to the other Czech-Moravian two words: "cow" and "cowl", "cowl" and "cowl" etc.
Some words that came into the Czech language from other languages were initially inflexible, but gradually they took over the Czech finals.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is a genus of male and female, or the word "buffet", which remained in the middle of the species unfavourable, in the male but has the finals according to the pattern of "city".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like directly on the Greek border?
At the Greek-Turkey border, there is tension over the increasing number of migrants who are trying to move further to Europe.
Thousands of people started publishing after Ankara stopped defending them to the south of Schengen.
European politicians promise Greek support, humanitarian aid is also coming from the Czech government.
What actually motivates refugees to take a false path?
And what does the situation look like right there?
Three months we haven't seen the blue sky and we've been breathing, describing a Sydney journalist.
The destructive fires that Australia has been in contact with for the fourth month have killed nearly three tenths of people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities there and the people themselves deal with the funeral?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison do more to prevent the drastic effects of criticism?
And what will the country have to prepare for the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a reporter from Sydney Iko Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why it's always written all over the place.
For people it's unpleasant to solve how sexual violence seems in our society and how widespread it is, it's trying to negotiate.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how those people often treat their neighborhoods or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But it's still keeping a lot of people for themselves.
Yes, they'll find someone who falsely accuses someone.
It's a nuisance and spit in the face with all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "large part of the charge is meant" and that it's "trend" you're only helping sexual rapists.
Czechs swim in scattered houses, families don't have the money to finish
The prices of construction materials have increased by more than 30 per cent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have fallen into a lucid state of affairs.
However, there is no means to complete broken down family homes and banks refuse to raise their mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the cost of construction works is also increased.
That's why people don't have enough money to complete the already-dissolved family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise their mortgage loans, creating an extremely unpleasant situation.
In a better case, people move to scattered and uninhabited homes.
In a worse case, scattered houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and to pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Kreček.
We'll build two or three family houses in a year, and at 50 percent it happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult to keep certain things contractually, even if the material has been stolen.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Sliven.
A lot of people are just gonna have financial problems.
If they calculated that the building is going to be five million, now it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," Sliven added.
The materials were made of copper, iron and also installation and heating equipment.
Construction companies, however, are also fighting the lack of labour.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of training graduates and the influx of foreign workers inhibits the pandemic.
It is more favourable at this time only for the issue of a building permit.
"Building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10% more than a year ago," Kretek said.
We're good and we'll get even better.
Real vision but missing, says ČRO commentator – mujRozhlas
The entry into the new year apart from classical celebrations has been traditionally conducted also by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and President Andreje Babiš and the Christmas Message of President Miloš Zeman and the President of the Senate and the House of Ambassadors, spoke to the nation.
What do we learn from the fundamentals?
As I get a super degree right now, I've got my own theme that I've chosen, I've got a bakery, I've always been working on it for a year, and then I'll write a piece of paper in a week or two.
The states are completely at peace with us, if there's no human being and something in his head remains, then the commission won't suck him out of theory.
I may have been studying at the state school for a week, and when I was in the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical drive that immediately hit me and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project to them (we did it many times, really beneficial, much learning) and then they just learn the project and they're getting old.
I think it's great when at the end of the subject is a test to which knowledge gained in the project is promised, not just defense.
All right, but don't count e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be just like them.
Those people at the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily build a similar statue of Putin next to a bear.
You had to give it to Xi Jinping on his ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws the artists a stick under his feet.
As soon as you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your achievements are reduced to a total minimum.
In addition, furt changes what is more important for function if the lake, comment or storage.
I've been really shitty lately, so maybe I'm gonna have to cut myself off to a hit where a lot of artists from my industry are doing their best, and they're not going to be able to afford it.
In the end, I might even like to see some user hotter that doesn't drain artists with all the creativity and energy.
Declaration by the working party on Donbase
The link – yes, the break-in – no, they express their view on the picture of the resistance to the break-in of the USSR.
Thirty years from the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind took place.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šusčević, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open vis-à-vis Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly signed an agreement that “the SSR relationship as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist”.
In one piece of feathers, they "removed" a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens were displaced abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by between 10 million and 11 million.
Despite the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars together!
Earlier, the same people who destroyed what was built in the past seventy years at one session in the Béloväjs pralese betrayed a socialist camp (made up of the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Civil War).
They have made deindustrialisation, they have made agriculture bitter, they have removed fourteen republics from the greatest power in the world, which were previously economically linked to the only mechanism.
If we want to see ourselves even deeper, then we see population poverty, economic breakdown, science, armies, crime growth, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all as a result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the first socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in politics as "vacuum force".
Everything that has been quickly wounded and abandoned has quickly been filled and acquired by NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And today the whole world is shaken mainly by events since the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large turnover does not have to directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it out of it on Thursday night.
In the alternative reality, where I don't buy this meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain is going to save it at 99 Kč / kg - do you write me a mechanism that will change the meat's price to make a contribution to my living system?
And either I'm waiting for Thursday and that meat will be reduced to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday at 120 CZK and left it in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These shits about that if something is cheap, then it must be guaranteed bad, infected or unquality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth;-)
I recently went to Brno at the head of the building and the lady in the basement gave me a brochure, like I always take things to help the brigades, they can't throw it out...
Well, the brochure was full of rural sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be some kind of agit.
After reading, I found someone who was publishing it, and finally science came out of it.
Well, like it was a good stepmother, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
It's a paper damage that wouldn't have to be the case.
I've experienced something like this with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional excruciating make you make this person make him recover because you like him without ever realizing how much in the p*part of the situation is.
Several times she threatened me with injuries because I went out with a friend she didn't like to fuck.
Or even when I wanted to get out of her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
Cca year was a great relationship, but then he ran another half year and started kicking her on the bat.
Then I ended the relationship with the fact that I told her I was getting out and lying to her, but we can talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch another amuk.
Such a person expresses your feelings, emotions, and total joy.
You'd better keep the distance.
When insurance is stolen by buying dark tests and hunting for positive ones who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we achieve is the complications for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator have fallen into five days of domestic prison.
In the west, they've already stopped with that scar and admitted that there's no value in solving the disease less than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the war is new, and there's something else to steal, and it's got to drive the ego through the invention of boozing.
I can see that we're back with the old good shit.
After a few years of discouragement and depression of this little business, MLM recruiting again returns to the ejection.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, champion of the U.S.), the initial promise of training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to care, mostly get people."
I was honestly interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but training was more about how to scare and bite people.
When the first money came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make it, he had to make several certain products monthly.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only viable thing, so you felt like a bottom salesman.
But what I can say is that experience was valuable, you learned that you shouldn't jump on every tip and check the information carefully.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw it all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even people are profitable, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumer goods or "just" accounts.
I haven't seen a lot of things like that in the corporate I'm doing.
The HR is calm, the managers look at their management and don't get too much into our noses.
So the regular evaluation is kind of going on, in the form that this is going on with us (set some goals for another year, let's look at what came out and what didn't) - it's more self-assessment than someone would evaluate you by some numbers, and so on.
The company's action is also not mandatory.
But even within our company, we're a little out of business - there are departments that are more "corporative".
Sometimes you feel like we're almost-startup that's squatting in the offices of the big corporation.
But it works so they don't poison us so much as long as there's results.
The Czech missing in Britain is after death.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police were constantly searching for missing 32-year-old Czechs, who lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in the demise of Jakub Kulhanek on social networks that a woman from Uherkohradsk had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police found a missing Czech citizen in London this afternoon.
The cause of death is being investigated.
In view of the family, we will not be able to provide more information in this case.
A sincere condolence, he posted on Twitter Kulhánek.
A young woman was last seen on the bus on November 28th on her way to work, and she was supposed to pick up the money from the ATM before her arrival.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues at work five days later.
After it, the London police began to search, Interpol put it among the missing people all over the world.
The missing persons also appeared in the Czech database.
The police in this regard have already detained one man a few days ago.
What he was supposed to do in the case and what he suspected of, but didn't publish.
At the end of the year, new representations were granted in four municipalities.
On Saturday 11 December in the municipalities of Komňa na Uherskradišk, Lužice na Mostecka, Nova Ves na Liberecka and Rovna na Pelhřimovska, the new representatives were elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law or the number of representatives elected here has fallen.
Of the 28 candidates there were 99 valid candidates in the new elections.
The vote reached 62.41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovna, where 93.62% of eligible volunteers were elected.
A total of 8 women and 20 men received the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidates were registered for new elections to the seats in these four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men in the 28 posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years.
Working out the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes relatively difficult but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to the general representations and, above all, very closely monitored elections to the House of Ambassadors.
Most of us, however, had to work under more demanding epidemiological conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personal security, assessed Eva Krump, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote shall be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and shall be published after approval in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To cope with the fact that we have a very dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning, it took me a while, but it went without a bigger backbone.
To deal with how foolish a large part of the population is getting into it on all its layers, I have a problem with it so far.
I look forward to it (to-morrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on the fact that other people aren't shit.
He'd be relieved of the President's function and his ability to re-acquire it.
It's a chance that it's really gonna happen, but how the others here mention very little.
Besides, I'm not sure if the corporeals of the file could be considered a joke at all.
The Grand Council is such an act that the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been more serious.
How pandemic affected intimate life: Increased number of people up to 35 years who are without sex all year
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
This is mainly about religious people, the DailyMail web site.
The study showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of those who are under 35 who deny sexual life rose from 8 percent to 21 percent.
A woman between the ages of 18 and 35 who said she had no sex in the last year is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the reduction in the number of sexually active individuals, as shown by the study of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavir pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks, or video games could also be a factor that makes for young people a lower and lower priority.
"From 2010 onwards, the share of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported that they had no sex in the previous year," said researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them indicated that they had no sex in the last year.
For free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage at age 35 is only a small percentage.
Then the fear of premarriage and religious foundation also contributes to the loss of sexual activity.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married younger than 35 years is still decreasing.
Young people share an opinion on premarital sex, about 30% of them have a bad thing, while about 70% think they're okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group are minority, but their behaviour shifts this trend," Stone says about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital relations, there is a religious foundation.
Since 2008, free people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month have increased the rate of abstinence from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the "less believers", the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors contribute to the reduction of sexual activity, such as less social interaction and mainly social alcohol drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that sex is less likely for people without work or with lower income.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which is likely to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, so they "repeat" this need.
This trend was mainly caught behind the lockdown during the choronavir pandemic.
The whole order of vaccination against cowardice is whether the company should force a part of the population to behave that they do not want but that can save their lives.
It is a relatively difficult question that I am personally interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is, if we don't do this to them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly for the death of an eighty-year-old who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, heard some disinformation, and as a result didn't see it and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can die of a staunch opposition to expectations, which on the side of the SPD and the KSCH is tearing down something about a fucked-up and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it is quite clear that most unaccompanied pensioners are probably part of the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech without snow.
How small is the winter signed in the fight against drought?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Skiing area operators will not pass without technical snow; the weather may complicate the preparation of the Jizera 50.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have a story, but it's not about a pancake.
Once on high school, the teacher took us all over the town on the shipyard so that we could get a project on the boats by the river.
The road was once so wide a street that we could not see in the middle of it - the rise of the Hare Krišna sect.
Of course they fell asleep on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but with a friend, they got into a speech.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including teachers, are laughing all the way to the shipyard.
We're so dirty.
It doesn't happen that much, but the system is already playing, says Orozović
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military instructions.
"We are opening up a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at the joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly declare that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders, is, according to the chancellor, a solution to the use of diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Nordic Group", which unites France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the Chancellor of the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially triggered a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record a hundred attempts at (illegal) border crossings.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor to finally understand that we have decided to prevent the EU's eastern border with Lukashenko's regime and its patronage in Kremla.
According to the DPA, the school assured Warsaw of German support in its dispute with Belarus, condemning the non-human treatment of Lukashenko's regime with runners.
A drunken Polish nun accused an accident, tried to hide it.
The car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was already driving another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police informed her that she could lose her driver's license if she didn't take advantage of the ride and was caught by the accident, she came out with the truth, reported the TVN24 station.
She admitted that she had been hit by another nun who asked her for help.
Then the cops came for Sister Celestina.
Her breathing tests broke, and after they found out she had two minutes in her blood, she was immediately given a driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would be brought before the court for her actions.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Yuraj Shammovich, but he didn't watch his movie.
The Czech family comedians saw themselves in American dog fairy tales.
But they forgot about the main thing: the legality of the film industry.
After the cat's movie F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people to live, now there's another picture in the movies here we watch.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmović ml. is free to apply to his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
On the scene, the speaker is Hugo and some famous figures around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the forest pension that he's staying, so they start calling him a doggie, Julie's father with a partner, and mainly her daughter Veronica.
She's not a little girl anymore, but a teenage girl who's in first love.
The director with partner Beatriz Šajmović (which is also a producer of the film) met with the talk procedures already in the previous dog picture, but there they played at least children and dogs.
This time she wrote a creative double even weaker script, which causes a mixture of awe and feelings of shame.
Let's figure it out.
Julie, as a scientist, is in a yearning for the child’s dark mistakes and if the right “constellation” comes, she is digging with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are – on the chapel of the car or church tower (of course during the tour with the local guide), the well-served Colonel Mojmir, despite his flight of training, shoots his own daughter in the forest (Julia), who falls into a coma, so that the family is taken by the hospital to play a miraculous process of healing dogs in the heart of the forest alone.
Nothing against the clean treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the monster is amazed at the content of the hummingbird full of incredible situations and figures needed for this message.
Two staff thieves, dog contests, a forest charlatan, police officers coming to the wedding to look for "drugs" and discuss herbs about the nutrient strength of bone marrow – and which burnt the family in the pension, of course, opium.
When a hero comes across a heavy comet and sits naked and loaded with a cigarette at the family table and requires his father’s whiskey and flakes in order to cure a vegetarian, he cannot be ashamed.
The show's creators will explain that "it happens sometimes after a comet".
Shammović's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of text work, the ability to build a portable situation, a sense of character and point and direction.
The performances are unbalanced, the cut is unresolved and the overall impression is flawed.
Whatever Lukaš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová is trying to get up, they don't have much to play.
The only bet on the film remains the poetic pictures of the forest nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomk and a couple of twins.
It is not enough to plan a number of characters, a chat room, and dogs of rumors, because of the more human vulgar expressions that characters allow.
The argument is not even summer membership at the Jet Farmers' Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and human friendship with the dog, the knowledge of the profession must also be if a person wants to tell a credible story.
That didn't happen in this case.
There's a little bit of eroticity and a minimum sense of gender.
Not even as an advertisement for canistherapy would this amateur-defined piece go through.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant instructions just from fools like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, there's a difference between seeing how shit you understand about it, but it's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always on the client, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to the furt, you might change your mind.
It's a job like everyone else, in which case the brigade for a bonus.
The Middle East has been suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season in the year when it rains.
"This complete absence of strikes during November, as we noted at some stations, is unusual," says the Israeli meteorological service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long - term rainfall in November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been a long time.
It's also the right Christmas scene, was delighted by the resident of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
The rains in Israel come only in the winter months, are offensive and irregular.
In the winter rains there are dependent forests.
Without them they beg and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, it's also about drinking water supplies, and a trap for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled this year in spring with the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Water managers have warned against drought a long time ago.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a collision," Israeli Water Agency spokesperson Uri Schor predicted in 2018.
Israel has the ability to help with technologies, such as the drainage or recycling of waste water.
Worse are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the main city of Jordan, Amman, there are tank cars.
Water and private colds are drying up.
"This year I received orders of up to seventy-eight percent compared to the previous two years," the driver of the tanker Imád Sulejman said in September.
There were clashes between farmers and security forces in Iran's Isfahan.
The reason for the protests was dry.
Coryto local rivers felt completely waterless.
The region has the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military action against Iran
The Israeli Defence Minister stated that the Vienna negotiations did not bring "no progress" and informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear devices.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military attack on Iran, Jonathan Lis informs.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to convince Americans to put their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During the Florida Gantz press conference, he said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them".
About three years ago, this happened to me.
I'm going to have a little bit of a barbecue to find out what she wants for me.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I don't really like these scams, so I've been having some doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked and left.
You can tell me I've been biting, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
The skiers went up the weekend, waiting for them enough snow and good weather
The Czech Mountain Centre experienced the first major ski effort this weekend.
After extensive snowing at the end of the working week, there is no snowing of the bridge and some skiers have thus begun to operate.
The Office has not fulfilled its duty to prove itself by means of a certificate of the person responsible for the tractor.
While tractors do not complain about customers’ interests, some ski rentals report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberian region were present for the weekend at the running trails and at the meetings.
The skiers wanted the weather that today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied that the start-up weekend has really come from the Friday evening skiing that we had on the top of the first ski," said Ještěd Jakub Hanush, the director of the Sports Area.
Hundreds of people took their first weekend skiing in the new season as well as in the Jeseník.
For example, Ski arena Karlov or the centre of Branná na Schumpersk was opened.
The weekend visit was very appropriate, and on Saturday, 400 people were estimated.
The conditions are appropriate.
Today the sun shone, it was about minus three degrees, so perfectly, it did not care about the famous representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators may sell skipas only to people who are choking or who are within a period of time after treatment of covid-19 diseases.
When people are prepared for the exceptions and prove with the necessary documents, the ČTK René Hronès from the Schpindler Mlýn ski centre said.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski rentals and ski shops.
It's a pleasure ski loan.
It's not like last year, but there's still a lot of customers, Alexandra Bokiš from the Dad's shop Skipova.
Greater effort is expected during ski courses.
The director of Snowbear David Shinták also feels that the care is not about borrowing ski equipment as much as before.
This time before the pandemic, we were almost disbursed.
On the contrary, in the period before the pandemic, we were about 50 percent, said ČTK Shinták.
According to him, people with pandemics became angry and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by a loan in the Novako area on God’s gift.
The ski rentals started there a week ago, and the interested parties have to order them now.
"We start to borrow lessons this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a great deal of interest, just like last year," said the operator of the Pavlín Novaková area.
The interest is comparable to the period prior to the epidemic, according to it, is also about a ski school.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health, where it is often not possible to reach a dentist or a doctor.
There's a lot of smart people going abroad who don't have any property.
The owner of the company abroad is not really going to leave.
You agreed with the rest, but you totally agreed.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don't have a sense of the future in the Czech Republic, they just won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began in such a way that one beautiful day Orbán won, ruled the year, and suddenly annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It's naive to think that the Czech can't feel in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the choice at all.
If he's gonna live here stupid, he can win some traditional V4 nut.
The young and educated will leave, remain his supporters and the people whose property will not be put into the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmaer in the blood for the beer beet?
While in the Czech Republic he was in the full stream in the fall, in Thailand the staff of the film Island in front of Jiři Langmajere (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
At the same time, the actor published bloodied photos of his face on social networks.
Is it a real injury, or is it a matter of counting for the film?
The London police are still looking for unintelligible Czechs.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Peter does not like her behaviour at all and we are beginning to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where Srnc worked.
“ Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her, and she wants to know briefly where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czech Republic said on Sunday, 28 November, around 19:45 she left work and moved home to Camberwell.
The last one was reportedly seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her collaborators.
According to British media, the heart acted as a "assistant of nurses" at the Children's Hospital of Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Hospital Association of Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We have enormous concerns about our dear colleague Petru, who is unconscious," said a group of health devices in a twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help her find to contact the police," the communication continued.
The public also calls for cooperation by Mrs Harriet Harman, who pointed out the case to the Srnca on Saturday at the press conference.
"She's been unconscious for a few days, she's only 32 years, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably to the death of the establishment," laborist politician said, holding in her hand a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her, because she was outside her home country, away from the family and worked here for our health," Harman said.
The police had previously held a man in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what he was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
That's not how I underestimate Ukraine.
It's not a huge amount, it's about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are increasing the threat of the Invasion and is beginning to have our entrance full of teeth.
I was quoting from up there.
I don't know why you decided that Russia wants the war.
The war is a hell of a fun and Russia has HDP Italy.
Compared to the situation in 38 is beyond so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this to the first Punish War and the "annex" sicilie :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it does not intend to comply with the agreements from Minsk, Russia annexes those ridiculous republics.
That's all and that's how the "concentration" on the borders would fit.
Ono, I'm a maid.
In Prague, since Sunday, new driving arrangements will be in place, mainly concerning suburban connections.
Travelers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, particularly concerning suburban connections.
New lines have emerged, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavska is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the main city from Sunday stop the fasts from Czech Budějovic at the Garden City station.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains will leave on the route from Beroon to the Czech Boat to Prague's main station.
In the recently operated Prague-Zradní City station, the R17 from the Czech Budějovic and Benešov will be stopped again.
The PID is now expanding to other areas.
Among other things, buses go to the Light nad Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, the Old Splavos and Turnova.
Buses to Mladoboleslavska will be included, including lines with crossing to the Liberian and Královéhradeck region.
When integration is completed, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operation will be adjusted.
From Prague, Zlíčina will start a new 405 bus line, which will go to Jatce.
There was also a new direct connection between Prague – Kralovice and Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be strengthened in the morning peak and on the weekend of the connection from Prague to Krakovník, when a new express line number 404 will be released.
New ones are included in the PID system lines 400 and 410 driving to the Liberian country.
They're leaving the Střížkov metro station, not the Holesovice Station.
The 400 parent line runs through Mělník, Dubo and Czech Lip to New Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Dox, Mimona and Jablonno in Podještěd.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or limited on ten of the central local routes, including Mochov, Dobříše or Rožmital under Trimšín.
All trains with departure from Prague are cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernisation of the railways, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolina.
The changes are also waiting for the traveler in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section to line 420 from Dobříš with a train from Prague, where it is possible to use PIDs to Milevska.
The routes 540 to 543 in Nymburg have been changed and the routes of some buses at the border of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic have been adjusted.
Healthy lunch in the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only way to get food is to go next to Billy or a bit further to Lidla.
Because I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet-free as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'll buy as fast as possible a pizza on the ground and a yogurt and apple cake.
Question: What would you recommend me buy in the supermarket without the need for a heat adjustment?
Not everyone's waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately they are.
And it's not trees you need to see.
Under the snow, only a point of a tree can be hidden.
If destroyed, the tree may be more susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're forbidden to drive outside the gym, but it's one of them.
Admitting Dara about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn’t really happy about this.
The Czech show business fisherman since Friday is nothing but revealing the relationship of Dary Rolins and Paul Neved.
They've been pulling it together for years, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
The gift now sent to the fans a comprehensive message explaining why the love was half secreted before them.
"I allow myself to claim that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia who would have avoided that Dara caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Nedwid," says Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But maybe he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they have no joy from it.
And it's here.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew that one day it would happen, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who have no interest in it and skip it out of the can, or we whose lives are in doubt about it.
It's like one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you're dating your husband or girlfriend enough, or you've been insisting that everyone really know the list of your ex-partners and were informed of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, it's okay, Dara.
The twins came together in Italy, where Rollins drove for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
For a long time, the bear has been acting as vice president of the Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth until now, because they were waiting for the end of the Negro's divorce.
Ivan's wife and I have been separated for three years, but the papers aren't theirs for just three weeks.
Anyway, those who are happy with us and wish us, thank you.
We're just people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have a heart in the right place.
And that's why I love my new husband, and just as he loves me, so I love him.
Hey, the other commentators probably already said everything important, I'm just confirming that colleges are great at first, my colleagues mostly met during the first semester or two and they made fun of each other, and then they found us to work together, which is my best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments don't usually go too far ahead, so you probably won't find that much right now, but looking at the offer certainly won't hurt.
Otherwise you will certainly avoid not only Ceylu, but also the surroundings (the streets such as Vranovská, French etc., that is quite a bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the district of Veveří is very student, the King's field, and in this direction it's fine, and it's close to most of the VUT faculties (I don't know exactly where you're going).
So I've never missed rent, but I'm a native Brnák, so I can possibly consult Brn as if you're missing any more information :)
But that's an example of a completely "normal" thought.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not fund enough some schools.
Whether they learn what they want and pay for it from their own or whether they go according to the state and pay for it.
However, we cannot allow a private actor to control a piece of education just because a few crowns come to a valuable state contribution and this will enable him to learn in schools what he wants.
Such a claim would be a slight loss of weight when written by a person who, two days earlier, said the following about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So the vote against it if someone goes to waste is the same as the vote against it to make a statue stand in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in cataloging/digitalization that (and for a long time professionals) it's either kind of coming from the eye, or they're going to write something in a way xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and to the note that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it.
Personally, I'd sort of be able to deal with it in some way, depending on the program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some sign database and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd suggest that the author or the printer just created his own sign that sits on what's physically on that coin.
PS: Is it not by chance the Odyssey Empire (Kingdom) rather than the Odyssey?
PSS: Someone's already broken it up for you.
Look at the comment with FILE
Politicians don't even know what's gonna be our presidency's theme.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with you.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is ridiculous.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, and no basic knowledge of English is available, that is the case of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and translators work, English is more suitable for non-formal relations, links between standards.
Moreover, with the English language, it is quite interesting, following the performance of GB from the EU.
I don't understand Ceyll's hate.
I've been working there for the third year and it's all right.
How many times do I drive from work I at 10 p.m. and never a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only say someone who's almost gone into it.
Yeah, most of the Roman population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is they block the hallway and park where they don't have :D is definitely not that I would be afraid to go out there tonight.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the center, I'd go quietly to it.
Lots of apartments are now rebuilt or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Daddy and beloved Gelem as a ball in the flesh!
Who's spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most of the people on the adventurous wedding lit their first candle, not Felix Slovak.
I don't have an adventurous fan, so there's nothing to light up.
I saw my grandfather, and I'm sure Lucie also has someone, said the bright saxophonist, who so confirmed Patras' words that he often visits her.
He visits, but he doesn't live in his house in Vinohradech, where Dada stayed alone after his departure.
The dictionary still doesn't know where it's going to be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anick, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: ZASE SPOLU!
But we were still talking about something, so it didn't come to Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I'm buying gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy Dad and Lucia something, maybe perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to cross a music video into Richman's club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I'll always find someone I like to have fun with, says the Slovakman who was happy to meet his wife on Saturday Adrian or the singer Kamil Nyvlt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor must be a total idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it's supposed to be a bad argument, so you'll explain it to me?
I don't know any other file that could be planted in hospitals in the crisis.
The police are few and they can't afford it, so firemen and nowhere else are the high percentages of people who are well trained at that level.
And the fact that our army is capable of preventing Ostrava from going to the head of previous governments, not the army, is asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not only be a food factory, the journalist says.
Czech Republic has been going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
Scientists say that water has died in mountain and subterranean areas, and the smaller part of the precipitation is also recorded in places where the need for the flag has not yet been met.
The cause of drought, which prevails in much of Central Europe, is climate change.
But the effects also strengthen the way in which we manage the land.
What do I prepare myself for in this regard?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's gonna be like this, I can barely stay in the ice tables, I know what it's like to play hockey, and the tactics (which I tried in the Franchise Hockey Manager) are also a total holocaust.
And whether you're a hockey team "Russian Bear" or "Lama China" you lose two goals, even though you don't have to win the game at any price except when compared.
But just as I listen to Czech commentators who write out what the decision-makers are not aware of whether the male or female hockey is really weird, so it's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have won more often than they've won, it'd probably be classic "they've won" to "MY we've won".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic reported 9080 daily injuries.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the PRC, another 74.
In the last 14 days, confirmed cases have been reported in the Czech Republic in 1967 to 100,000, 871 to 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours 29 929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number since 13 October.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain faces the "unavoidable" great wave of infection caused by Omicron, said on Sunday on TV by Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor to the British Health Office.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Omicron infected people are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to rise.
So far no one has died on the micron, but hospitalization occurs about fourteen days after the infection and about three weeks after the infection.
The chief of British Labour Keir Starmer observed on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by arranging a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when it was set up and the Christmas party was banned.
One of Johnson's government ministers argued that the quiz was done "virtually", through the computer.
However, he participated in the Downing Street group of employees gathered around the computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the prime function is increasing.
During last December, when a tight lockdown was introduced in London and the Christmas party was banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous weddings despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media say that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial television editor for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won most of his career in general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing it from the prime minister's office.
It's remarkable how fast the events developed.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting the spring of elections that can end the twelve-year-old government of Viktor Orbán.
It will be a choice of European importance.
How can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They're probably not even free, because they weren't even the last two choices under Orbán.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the border of electoral districts to benefit from it, and makes more or less tricks.
So far, the last one sounds like everyone can choose where they want.
This will allow Fides to balance voters from selected districts into those where the result is unrealistic and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
It was a matter of whether or not Fides won, but how much and whether or not there would be a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will get united opposition.
It's a big habit for Victor Orbán and his side.
Won't they try to keep playing even harder?
Yes, we have some evidence that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, the record of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fides László Kövér has been avoided in independent media, where secret service heads state that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those papers.
It's all starting with the language.
I was beaten quite often, last in 14, my mother's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, her father has a long time, but then she smells extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I'm very choleric, and I've grown up like a little scary, to the point that I've been lying on the ground in a crack and I've been all blue, it took me about 2x under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they danced to me, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I'm definitely also now tending to deal with violence like a little I've been pretty washed up, now I'm kicking into something, and as a young man, I need parents to cry through the hand of the need (to get too much through the hold), so I never get anything extreme, but I always have it.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but it's definitely got a part of it.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my children, and I'm going to solve it anyway.
I think it's just wrong to be a child and that my parents didn't have to do it, especially when it wasn't "educational," but from frustration, on the other hand, if every parent just shits, it's probably not possible not to waste at least a little bit of their children, so I don't teach them.
I don't mind. I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are to be clear and clear.
So I'd call Kundami those who make the laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of an income accident?
You can really count on people wanting and buying the product and you'll have what mortgage to pay for?
He's a clumsy world.
Where does Slovakia move the process with the killers of Kuciak's journalist?
In Slovakia, the main count begins in the trial with four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martiny Kušnír.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She moved the civil society, but also discovered the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočer and his connection to the pinnacle of Slovenian politics and justice.
How will the fundamental breach be the process for Slovakia?
That's what the press can do.
How is it possible that this petition had more regular media attention than the antiquities of the deacons of all medical colleges that went from day to day, two later?
Well, they let it go, and the company missed it.
On the Czech TV, she died with the covid half a year ago.
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the choice of warehouses nowhere
Proposal by Minister Karl Havlíčka needs to be recast in principle
The government of Prime Minister Andreje Babiše is at the end and the law to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in the selection and approval of a high level of radioactive waste storage facility still does not exist.
The Government's Legislative Council interrupted the negotiation of a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the Government after the flights.
However, its contents are in serious contradiction not only with the municipalities involved in the Platform against a deep warehouse, but also with the city and municipality of Svaz.
Self-governments of the law expect to significantly strengthen their ability to decide on depositors, which are promised to the caretakers since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which requires the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition treaty, to rework its proposal in cooperation with the foreigners.
The draft law of the Minister Karl Havlíčka, who has the Platform available, concerns the municipality in particular: The proposed rate of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the decision-making process for the site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
It can be effective only if the locality or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in the locality.
This may be ensured by the depositary's obligation to request prior to the commencement of the specific procedure of the agreements of the municipalities concerned.
The proposal for a substantive purpose is almost completely ignored by public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipality practically mere statistics in authorisation procedures.
In the proposal, there is a lack of systematic compensation for the entire process of searching and selecting the location for storage, authorisation and operation.
The representatives of the municipalities really do not have the opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place to store.
However, only in certain authorisation procedures may they give their comments or withdraw, the authority or minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be issued shall decide.
Any action shall not have a deferral effect on the conduct of research or construction works.
The co-decision of the self-determinations requested by the Platform is usually used in many democratically advanced countries and definitely in those where they have already advanced to the approval of the warehouses, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, in addition to the failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the lawyer's office HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which has been concluded by SURAO and which is subject to contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánk.
According to the contract register, the total amount for this work is to be equal to 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknikka, the mayor of the town of Ceyle from the town of Hådek and spokesperson Platforms against the deep depositor said: After the ministers of industry, who compared the position of self-government towards the state authorities when looking for the deep depositor of high radioactive waste, we are waiting for a more significant turn.
We offer you a hand to do that.
We also thank Svazu for the support of the cities and municipalities, which consider the problem of the insufficient rights of the municipalities in such a basic building as the one directly concerned in the selected localities.
The Platform against a Deep Warrant brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 companies) to bring about a change in the state's access to nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep warehousing.
The platform further encourages that the decision to select the location for possible storage should be conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
John Goodman's heart (69) caused him to lose his fear: Shotil 90 kg.
Although he had not had to change anything in his life - style for many years, he was finally intimidated by doctors.
They told him that if he doesn't forget, he'll die.
And that's what it took.
Goodman gradually weighed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new position in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated The Freak Brothers series.
There's a whole different man from the fat from Roseanne's sitcom!
John was pleased to hear that his friends and family asked him to lose because his large body caused the collapse of the furniture.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in 2018 in a conversation for AARP.
This time, I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to the age when I can't afford to sit there anymore, he said to ABC Goodman, whose change is amazing.
It also matters what boss and what kind of boss you want to use.
If it was some text on a platform that was expecting readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't have translated it at all.
If it was a formal text and a high school text, I'd probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Maybe the game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses that yes, and so "boss" is something like a master/lord given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games are hiding bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who do not even need to beat to finish the game or level, but often are even stronger than standard bosses.
Then you need Half-Life games where the bosses are, but the player doesn't run directly with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they're called anyway?
Well, then they're mini bosses.
It's a casual way to translate a boss just like not going, Czech or other languages doesn't sort of solve it (it's interesting that only Catalan who translates the boss as a final opponent).
It is a short story or game of general importance, the computer controlled, the opponent stronger than all previous and monitoring completion of a level or task.
After missing Peter from London, he's haunting the whole world.
The Czech police joined in.
After missing Peter Srnc's search for the British police since 3 December.
The Czech police were involved in the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherkohradiška has been looking for since 7 December.
At the same time, Interpol is helping the British police.
Czech Peter Srnch saw her colleagues last November 28th.
The British police have been after her since December 3.
Interpol gave up a so-called yellow circle for her.
So after Peter, he's been searching the whole world.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokesperson Katerina Randlová said.
"We share information on the case," she added.
The reported search for Peter has already been made on the police website.
According to him, it is 168 centimeters tall, it is thin and has ugly eyes and long equal hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherkogradska.
Peter worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are afraid of her, such disappearance is very unusual for her
Mrs. Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Peter.
She's joined us in hanging out the planes with Peter's face.
"We have great concerns about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance of the British police officers, one suspect was detained.
But it's not clear who it is and what it was with Peter.
Pre-night Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decrease in the number of attacks, the attacks were significantly increased last month with the coming year’s end.
We had a big campaign with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted towards the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for the time being.
The infected Annex in the e-mail shall raise the user’s attention to the name referring to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous annex in the name of the invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the repair of the account by 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eseta.
Spyware contains functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code is actively searching for stored login data that it subsequently sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the break of August and September and with the coming holidays and the end of the year the activity of attackers is growing again.
In November he remained active as well as spyware Formbook.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November captured more campaigns with global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook has weakened slightly in November, but it still stands for almost five million of all detections.
The attacks were carried out continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
Formbook contained the most common annex with .exe which bears the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the account continues to appear.
The annex in Czech may then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decrease and deceleration of activity are seen by security analysts at Fareit, which stood at 1.6 per cent of attacks and in the Czech Republic for the past few months had no major attack campaign.

The Prague Guide was bigger than the media reported.
I don't fear to estimate about 10,000 people, according to the coast and my experiences of the demonstrator.
The people in the pipeline filled the shores and the bridge and the opposite.
That means people really are a lot.
In turn, some 4,000 demonstrators are spontaneously added to the unknown number of passersby.

That lasting dissatisfaction with several large groups or groups of people led to their finding a common language.
It's just that the anti-traffickers, the anti-traffickers, and the other guys, they wouldn't be able to fill in or pay.
The action of Chcípl dog has a rise in popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for the border democracy.
Sometimes I feel like they're renting the same stage and technique.
It is hard to say what a move from this dissatisfaction might be, not only depends on the cash flow, but also on whether a three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not be four and more doses.
It's definitely not gonna be left-handed or middle-handed, so bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, because it is clear that we will have to let ourselves get over half a year.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists that humanity is proud of.
At the end of the day, Bulgaria has a new prime minister reporting a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has entrusted Kiril Petkov with the creation of a new government from the anti-corruption movement We continue in the change that won the November elections.

In Britain, concerns about 32-year-old Czech fate have grown over the weekend, after which the London police have been investigating for several days.
Petra Srnc was last seen two weeks ago when she went from work at home to the south of the British metropolis.
According to information on the children's hospital's work, she calls the police and her former employer or the deputy representative of London, where she lived.
