Be very careful with that.
I just wish I could speak French a little better.

I think you've done enough.
Tom took off his jacket.
Mary threw Tom's eye at him.
There's something important I need to discuss with you.

I'll clean it up.
She gave me a nice doll.
I haven't seen you since we were students.
You know, it's funny.

Go get ready to lie down.
It's not a weapon.
This coat is covered with leather.
I didn't know what I was giving up.
Speaking French is a big party.
Have you actually tried?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
Spring's late this year.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much smaller.
You haven't given me as much as you need.
I can find time to help you.

You don't understand.
I'm used to my parents ignoring me.
I'm extremely busy.
I don't speak French well.
There was a picture in his letter.

Don't say anything to anyone.
I saw you playing tennis.
Looks like they got caught up with it again.
I'll take that in mind.
Just close your eyes.
She's keeping the secret for herself.
Is that your chemist?
He's gone aimlessly.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I think that should be expected.
This book is in easy French.
I have to go now.
His wish was finally fulfilled.
Do you want to become a trusted user?
I'm confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They serve great food here.
Tom, where are you?
I'll study French this afternoon.
I had difficulty resolving this problem.
How long will it take?
They look so much like themselves, I don't know what it is.
We've had very bad luck.
Please, be patient.
Tom speaks French better than Mary.
Can you recommend some other hotels?
My rain stopped me from coming.
Ken calls me every day.
Our departure was delayed.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I don't deserve any sympathy.
Can't you do that?
They're too small.
He gave me what I needed.
How I missed you!
When I grow up, I'll marry Tom.
It's gonna be some kind of start.
How much sugar do you put in?
Looks like she's got a lot of friends.
It wasn't serious.
Tom whispered to Mary something in her ear.
You can't speak English, can you?
The trees started to cover themselves with the list.
Look at my fingers.
She speaks good English, but not as much as her brother.
I was really confused.
You don't eat of the cake that I made, and your sister eats.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't speak French today.
I think it's yours.
Stand up, please.
Who told you my name was Tom?
That's Tom's.
I'll come too.
Can I open the window?
Let's ask him.
She's on a diet.
Speak out loud so everyone can hear you.
It's not our fault.
Will you go back to the beach this afternoon?
She's three years older than me.
I don't want to tell Tom I was in Boston.
I admire the culture and courtesy of the Germans.

I have to read this book.
He's married to a stewardess.
Everybody's waiting for you.
What he loves is a desire.

Let's talk English.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
When's the last time he went to the beach?
Don't give up.
Because she was crying, we didn't go to a picnic.
I wish Tom could be here today with us.
I'm in the house.
Should I open the window?
Are you sure you don't want to do that?
I have to get to the hospital.
Let me see that.
We were thrilled by the news.
Are you cold?
I've never had anything from Tom.
I need you.
I like to listen to classical music.
I agree with his opinion.
Tom can speak French a little.
I'm sure Tom won't want to work late.
I was motivated.
I'll get a job.
Do I have the right to join you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They understand their neighbors well.
Didn't Tom say anything about it?
French isn't that hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to you.
No one else offered to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What are the goals?
If we just stop trying to be happy, we'll have a good time.
I forgot his name.
We don't hurry.
She's more shy than social.
I got to the station after the train left.
I've never seen a whale live.
You want to wear my jacket?
I'm not gonna ask him.
Be brief, please.
That's all Tom has to do.
I think you should be crazy not to go.
These people are a lot of people.
I've waited so long.
You obviously don't want to do this for me.
Fresh fruits are useful to you.

I've been waiting too long for this moment.
Do your children know French?
I bought some Romanian books for the students.
Are you sure you want to leave?
It's perfect.
I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we need to find out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
Are you still happy?
I think you've been here too long.
Didn't I interrupt something important?
The patient recovered a little bit.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom asked Mary about her family.
Just through my body!
What's the minimum wage in Morocco?
It's weird, isn't it?

I've got documentation to format.
I'll come with you.
Please sign here.

We'll be together soon.
She's messing with you.
Why don't you follow me?
Tom and Mary had a medieval wedding.
We're always looking forward to Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love kids, don't you?
I thought you didn't like Tom.
I think we need to find out who Tom's planning to give it.
It's amazing!
That's all you can really do.
It's time to have a good-bye.
France borders Italy.
Simple numbers are like life, they're completely logical, but the rules for them can't be discovered, even if you're spending all your time thinking about them.

I worked all the time this week.
It happened today.
I haven't seen Tom in a month.
Can you recommend some other hotels?

Have you seen my camera?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Show us.
There's nothing on his mind.
Do good to those who hate you.

I have problems with my back.
They're going to party for Sam.
Jane is the president's secretary.

I'm not a traitor.
Tom was in charge of Mary's death.
The moon is made of cheese.
Their way of life is different from ours.
I don't want to keep you.
This meat is chicken.
I'm older than him for three years.
I think it's okay.
What else is in your pocket?
There was no place else to go.
The man kicked her away.
One hug of yours will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We've been waiting with low expectations.
I hear Boston was pleased at this time of the year.
What's your nickname?

Honestly, honey, I don't care!
He himself refused to speak to her.
This painting is beautiful.
He didn't say anything that angered her.
That's too little.
I haven't seen you here before.
Their coming here was a mistake.
He was wounded in the crash.
Now the question is how.
I like to speak French.
There were widespread rumors of the defeat.
It's very short.
Stop going back to your glorious days or you'll stay there.
I'm not tired at all.
What's the point of coming in time if everybody else's late?
The blow of the wind blew the rain directly in my face.
I want everlasting life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll be happy.
That's not a problem.
Did you leave a kiss?
Looks like there's nobody at home.
I'm gonna have to cancel this request.
So you're just not gonna do anything, are you?

Those two shirts are made of the same material.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Did you write your homework?
I have to decide what my priorities are.
What's your father's name?
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
He's mad at you.
Tell Tom he can't go.
Christmas's coming.
I intend to win.
Many of the children were almost naked.
Tom, I think we should help Mary.
They hired a Hamal company to bring things to their new address.

Tom wasn't used to it.
This guide may benefit you on your journey.
Is your watch true?
Give me another chance.
Ken wants a bike.
I like to do gardening.
They've been drinking coffee for over two hours.
It's an honor to be here.

Watch where you're going.

You both look very young.
I was forced to lie.
This is Tom's favorite camera.
Tom stole my wallet.
Tom didn't have much time.
She read all my books herself.
Tom doesn't make mistakes often.
I can see how confusing this is for you.
She despised him.
You're the boss!

I have to admit, I was worried.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Can I open a can?
Learning a foreign language is an interesting activity.
Tom's a believer.
This book is yours.
Sounds interesting.
I've prepared a list.
I'm not betting anymore.
That's my brother's.
This dress is worth the money.
Tom stuck his shirt.
I don't remember sending the letter.
Why does he look angry?
Tom speaks French.
How hungry are you?
We made them keep quiet.
We're a little late.

It's okay.
Tom's not gonna be in the bank at the time.
I don't think you really want to.
Looks like you've made a significant success since the last time I saw you.
The station is in the center of town.
Don't even try to come.
Both are unpredictable and impatient.
So did I.
I don't like how you behave.
What are we doing here?
The object is outside the direction of this investigation.
You sat in my place.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You have to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It'll be all right.
I almost have no French books.
Although I'm old, you're still young.
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
I'm planning on going there.

He had 30 witnesses.
He cursed her fate.
I found the key under the eraser.
As far as I can tell, they'll agree with us.
You don't have to figure out a reason if you don't want to come with us.
I saw her clean the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.
I heard you talking to Tom.
That's one less problem.
Tom asked Mary to take the toothpaste and toilet paper from the super.
You have to work hard.
This hat doesn't work for me.
What's the minimum wage in the U.S.A.?
He's on a diet because he's a little overweight.
Are we sure we want to appoint Tom?
You're taking something to drink, you're breaking through with elbows to the Swedish table, and you're eating like a pig!
These technical terms are of Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Hold the rocket tight.
Going home, I saw it again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were serious with Tom.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate myself.
I don't teach lessons.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.
Tom's naked.
I think what Tom did was very stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a bearer of language.
I'd like to find an account.
I heard you talking.
We immediately became friends.
Tom spent the weekend at his house on the shore.
Your black one's leaving.
You know everything about me.
Let me think for a second and I'll contact you.
They're interesting people.
Please call me from time to time.
Tom checked your pants' pockets.
Stick to the facts.
I wanted to talk about your evaluations.
No one was hurt.
It's not a literal translation, it's really wrong.
I forgot your number.
How much wheat does this field produce?
I haven't seen you in three years.
Are you sure you want to know?
You can't stop him from drinking.
You're doing very well.
It's your way, it's your fault.
Will you give me a fire?
He drinks his coffee clean every time.
I don't have any information on Tom.
She found a job as a mechanic.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should've worked harder.
Her sweater is purple.
Now that I've registered, what should I do?
Clearly, Americans cannot even solve their own problems, so how do they even imagine they are able to deal with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a goad.
From now on, I'm going to learn French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
Yesterday was terribly cold.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature in college.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
We'd gone crazy.
I think you'll be happy.
Teenagers have left.
I wish I was rich.
I'm just about to start.
If you need anything, just call.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot.
She bought a toy for the kid.
I didn't get an answer from you.
She cut her hair in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to take his keys with his fingers on his feet.
His method of teaching is good and bad.
I heard Tom's version of what happened.
Everything I want is you.
I'm looking for a small suitcase.
He became a witness to the murder.
I'm flying to Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that it had nothing to do with the matter.
I love the party.
That's the camera I bought yesterday.
The fields are no longer fashionable.
I think we'll need more time.
They'll meet at the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please do it again.
That's what I think.
Many museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he ate something toxic.
Don't make me do it.
You've been sitting in my place.
Don't give me God!
Your green's going.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a beach restaurant.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you are, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
Everything Tom said would have been a lie to me.
What's tomorrow's the time?
Are there children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way we can hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like to take pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wine?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom was sitting on a dunk.
The girls were dancing in the living room.
She's convinced her son is still alive.
Do you have any French books?
Finally, I stopped in front of the old house and looked back at the city.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My father's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There's a lot of ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm joking.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus came empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mother's got a nice letter.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the board.
Tom stuck his shirt and then put his tie on.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's good at everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
I'll have you back in any time.

Can you eat raw strawberries?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train passed 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compact disc.
The director considered the possibility of firing Tom, but decided not to.
I've got to take it off.
Tom was sitting by the window.
I don't think you really want to do it.
Most of their students were from the West Bank.
Is it possible that this is love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?

Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that nobody said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
They all jumped.
Many traders were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we wear clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's start.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than average growth.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful shirt.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any prayers.
Naita Tom, I don't know him that well.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She's calling me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national characteristics.

This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
Would you like me to reduce it a little?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me.
You can do it. Come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really wouldn't have made it without you.
I'm not mad at you. I'm just so disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you and my younger sister leave at the same time?
The match was delayed for some time.
His brother teaches a lot.
Ken has arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit a museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming in to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That book of cowboys could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's against it.
What's the minimum salary in New Zealand?
I'm shopping with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes rarely.
His empty attempts to seduce her showed him that the address was wrong; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're related souls.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have an appointment with him at lunch.
The invitation said there would be cracks and non-alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the souls?
Mike's running very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.

I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
Do you speak French too?
I just started studying French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
One boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are these explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Tom has little hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a good trip?

I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to take Tom to the bridge.
If I were you, I'd ask for this job.
The patient was discharged from the hospital.
My internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.

I was fascinated by her opera song.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
There's a lot of other tourists here.
The door slammed and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The twin brothers look completely alike.
Don't mess with Tom.
I didn't understand the smile.
Bass hunts that you know him.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you say that again, please?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I have a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I'm learning French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy some rice?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted an invitation to visit Mary's feast.
You're not just gonna be there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm mad at myself.
It's done by Tom on his own.
You won't believe what people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't carry much luggage when you travel.
I got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They're both working.
Tom's not welcome here.
Blame her for lying to him.
It doesn't make any sense to be mistaken, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very excited about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given an advantage over the others.
I moved you.
Take it with you.
Wait a minute.
I'm swimming once a week.
I've been waiting an hour and a half.
He made a public laugh at me.
The crucible burned.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Cut it.
How about we have dinner together?
I think he lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it weren't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
That's the picture I took at Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
We all assumed that Tom could speak French.
Tom came back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about the museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I'm not accusing you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do what you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I'm thinking about learning how to swim on vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are Jaints playing tonight?
I have the feeling that he won't let me get off so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
The school starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped over the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered with snow.
One hug of yours will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right by the beach there's a really good restaurant that I think you'd like.
What made you think so?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I totally wiped you out of my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum wage in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.

By the way, have you been talking to him lately?
Sentenced to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
At least once he thinks with his head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about it for a while.
You got nothing else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you get up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We should have obeyed their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so lie down early.
That was really stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I don't have anything to offer.
I'm talking to my French employees.
That's my sister's picture.
Tom's having trouble dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her advice.
The room was so relaxed that I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He definitely loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she's not feeling well.
Is the spot gone too?
I promise I'll bring him back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a slipper.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I need to go talk to Tom.
What do you say we study together in the library?
I have a job to do.
The proposal for work is still in force.
Your shirt is missing a button.
I have to go out for a while.
Your green's leaving.
Push your fingers.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
Uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working on the open.
Tom pushed the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
They're doing a kitchen service in this store.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is nice.
Please, get me another cup of coffee.
Alice may be coming.
How are you doing?
I've had a good time.
I'll stay until the next day.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Any of your team speak French?
Looks like it's starting to snow.
I've never seen anything like this before.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been to the top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom's jumping.
What's the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused heated debate.
Eat on a live meal every morning, and nothing worse will happen to you all the rest of the day.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
Last night I couldn't wait.
Russia loses 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you have to stop your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We're learning French at school.
He said it himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I can't tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please be patient.
Your joke's getting too far.
I've had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered sea water.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom wanted to be unbounded.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
Uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
I ate pizza every day last week.
I promise I'll bring him back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
Looks like you're wrong.
His daughter became a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, it says something.
Do you want some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened my check account.
He was here at the time.
I put on my shoes right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you deal with French every day?
Don't make that much noise, please.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
Where do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They're gonna play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't give up.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take the bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital with a helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found that Mary had disappeared.
It's your shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's married to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In the waitout, the existentials end with "o". A multiple number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Won't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student in my class.
I'm buying tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come to our guests.
Will you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
The triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What's the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you going to go home?
I wash my clothes.
I heard French is a hard language.
I haven't fed myself.
You'll soon stop thinking about her.
Let me see.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big company.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Get up and lie down.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you learned French?
Carol's back at her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
He's off the train.
Mary goes out with two at the same time.
I still don't remember Tom.
Give it to me.
Did you finish everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was awake at 5:00.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect to the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't tell me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
It's much easier for Tom to speak English than it does in French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more efforts.
I've done my job.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got boned hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
He's a little left.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operating in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask Tom to call.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return your favor.
Tom interrupted the hammer to see if there was a chemical that could be used.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran out after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more precise.
Tom's French is really pretty good.
Isn't the weather great?
I don't like that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to learn hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explains in detail.
Don't let Tom pass.
He was playing football with an empty can.
I think you'd really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
Then his ignorance is understood.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French isn't good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll set him up a farewell party.
Which club do you belong to?
Azushi may have been sick.
Tom doesn't get on the bus.
Some books seem to read over and over again.
Now we're working together.
Go back to your place.
He's done with Cambridge with a distinction.
I have to bring her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Did Tom teach French at school?
What shoes do they wear?
We've certainly done our best.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warmed up.
He's starting to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do it.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
That's the picture I took at Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My dad runs every morning.
I saw Tom walk on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't stand up too fast.
She gave up all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Come on.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim is very attractively dressed.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
It's okay to create a website, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She's got a beautiful letter.
The fingers of the hand are five: thumb, indicator, middle finger, unnamed and poor.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've solved the problem with the light.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
Up and down how much does a cab come out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have till tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiastic began his worthy respect for the beginning.
I saw you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, his local cowboys laughed.
He looks like he's in the hole.
I think you should come and see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more precise.
I'm on vacation this week.
You're wearing your shoes.
I promise not to do that anymore.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't know French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I don't doubt his sincerity.
Please open the package.
I'm pulling.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you please tell me your name?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Is he watching the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time for them to leave.
She grins every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Would you like to speak in French?
Well, that's tough.
Don't make me look nice.
I don't have any money.
Honey's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom wasn't used to living in town.
Keep Tom under your eye.
Jane's out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long fields are demo now.
He's doing very well with the kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
He finally stopped raining snow and the weather got warm.
She was making no very simple hints what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I study in French every day.
I've heard every word.
Where did you break your socks?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons that are properly used are useful.
What are we gonna eat?
Keep it a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't expect too much.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you give me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a chemical genius.
It can't be like you're walking around here and you're starting to abuse people.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got stuck and couldn't get there in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom is working hard to improve his French.
It's been wasted a lot of time.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you a fool.
Today I'm spoken in French.
Will you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it inside.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of applause when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was done.
His shirt was stuffed with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You're not gonna be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Ann a doll.
What are you doing, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I read this book.
It was a good year for you.
He was clean.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a gift.
One's safe, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told quite soon that he had cancer.
Tom got home by bus.
For me, a meeting in the afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's this?
It was too easy.
I travel often.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your goodness.
Let's split the prize fifty to fifty.
Squeeze my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think it's better for you to lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday here.
I need to know.
Do you like traveling?
Your plan has failed.
Tom had a big party in his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long are you gonna have to wait?
Tom is the man who told me when the meeting was going to be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
Soldiers started coming home.
I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy seems so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
She's grown up.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to see a movie.
Whoever's well prepared, don't worry.
It was fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on whose list the cobbled bugs live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I've got news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let that happen again.
You put me in pain.
I've tried everything I know.
Why are people afraid of her?
He's been fighting the hepatitis for six months, but it looks like he's recently begun to recover.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
How much is the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you tell me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they bow to their diseases.
I wouldn't think Tofuto was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
Now what time is it?
Then what does that mean?
I haven't had my turn yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
Do you think so?
He learned to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm running out of venison.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about it, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends, and eventually everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom's talking to the French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow before.
Ken can swim, can't he?
Tom and Mary went to the moonpark.
I thought it was best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you watch carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone called.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom finally left.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't come to the party.
This is the sweetest bitch I've ever seen.
I'm not mean.
At this restaurant, the food is nice.
I don't care about this.
Are they confused?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
The unemployed are creating it.
I have to get my son at 2:30.
Sugar is sweet.
Where are you going?
That's a big verse.
The prices have dropped lately.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to take me down?
If you're late for the control transmission, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to transfer Tom from the other side of the bridge.
Where should we go?
You can't be mad at me for that.
I grabbed the cat for the door.
Looks like he'll win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There were a lot of frogs in that lake.
I understand that very well.
Depends on the context.
Has anything changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read in French, can you?
Fred's often late for an hour.
Don't cry.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love the coupons.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him come down the stairs.
A friend will be visiting tomorrow.
I hope this will happen.
Maybe Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us to the center.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can learn here.
Let me help you.
You'll get it!
I'm afraid I touched you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's been deprived of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary.
Put these shoes on, please.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to leave.
He's got Russian hair.
I don't know when he's coming.
Mary told John the secret.
I'm going to study French next semester.
Tom won't speak today.
I'll see you tonight.
I'm done with my money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing ever happens as you thought it would.
Why don't you wear a tie?
Children must obey their parents.
Is there any error in this exercise?
Can you come over on Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I look at him as my best friend.
No one picked up the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're teaching the exponent.
My new bike is worth 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep him till later.
They're best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so superficial.
I've got some great news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel went down because of the earthquake from the previous day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary was speaking Japanese slowly.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Close the goddamn door!
We were playing with him about it.
John came a week ago.
He turned down the offer.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
The razor is a man who shaves his beards and cuts men's hair.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are patient and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around.
Tom loved singing, but nobody wanted to hear him sing.
Tom wasn't lying on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not mean.
I'm the most common office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen the kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I'm not coming in time.
He often goes on foot to school.
The torso stinks.
When will you get married?
That's pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're hot.
How many episodes of "Wan Pace" have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is the difference big?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're both sweet and sweet.
My sister lives near Yokohama.
I think you should do the deal.
My intention wasn't that.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, I'm asking you a lot-- spray some insecticide behind the refrigerator.
She denied me that I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is improving.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your bag.
Soon after that, he started to fall.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permission.
Tom sent a message to Mary written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation's over, he says good-bye, and he wants me to have a good evening.
Let's check it out.
So far, you've done a good job.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't stand it.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was that?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him herself.
I got a job for Tom.
Where did you throw them?
As usual, the physics teacher is late for the hour.
Let us see what is right and what is wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I shoot you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I saw you somewhere.
You've been sitting in my seat.
I've already tried that way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this toilet.
You're in the winning series.
I want to drink something.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She leaves no time for anything but to take care of the baby.
Nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be worried.
I don't think Tom's number is on the line.
Can you do it on your own?
Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
She's having a good time after dinner.
These containers are closed in hermetically.
He's the best player on our team.
I've seen you before.
There's nothing.
I want more information.
Are you carrying a gun?
He says he avoided the danger by pretending to be dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Watch out for her.
Don't shoot.
Isn't that surprising?
He's friends with everyone he meets.
You need to learn harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand that.
He broke into a house.
I came later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was trembling out of fear.
I was your mother's first friend.
The karate broke our unity.
How much money can I take with me?
Tom's with the French.
I'm falling for stories like that.
I've gotten used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just shopping.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Who are these socks?" "My sister."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a tall, strong blonde.
I gave Mary a book.
His doctor told him not to eat between the main meals.
Is there any survivors?
The pole is sticking at her feet.
We've chosen Jack as president.
That's my friend Tom.
They broke up with each other.
Tom is a French teacher.
We're going down to the next station.
Tom asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's with light skin.
Thank you. That's all.
The engine doesn't want to light.
I'm early.
Let's go to the secret.
Jesse accepted the invitation right away.
Jack Nicholson grew up in New Jersey.
Is there a free will?
I'll be there.
I think that's Tom's motorcycle.
I have to go see Tom.
It's been a long time since the last such beautiful surprise for me.
Let's play Canadian.
I think we have enough time.
That's a nice girl.
Let's have lunch.
I've waited so long.
Aren't they sweet?
I can't change these plans.
I'll be home soon.
He was traveling for work.
I had a little temperature this morning.
The medicine works.
I can't go anymore.
Tom has a very big nose.
Is this the right direction for the museum?
The school starts at eight and a half.
It happened twice.
Deep breathing is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We're confused about you.
He can't read.
You're doing all right.
The disputes won't solve anything.
Maybe he's wrong.
I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and remember the newly learned words.
I think they know us.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you sleeping?
Our team was with red flags.
How about a beach walk?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say cheese.
Tom won't be paid.
The rain stopped me from coming out.
When I was your age, we had to walk up the slope to school, both ways.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
No more, thank you.
I've already tried.
I think you're working too hard.
He drank a lot yesterday.
That won't help you.
Just do what Tom says.
Prisoners were released.
Be careful with that.
I can't see anything.
The meeting was postponed.
You don't have to take it.
It was a great day.
How old was he?
That's off!
Tom doesn't see you.
I wrote to my French teacher in French.
Aren't you coming?
I'll stay till lunch.
I forgot his name.
I think you'll be happy.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Then where's the problem?
It wasn't that hard.
It's business.
Please lock the safe.
She broke up with me.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to learn French.
Tom gave Mary his visit.
I think it's better if you stay with Tom.
Tom didn't do it.
That's the job I chose myself.
I think we're out of gas.
Let me tell you something about myself.
We pushed the car.
What is the minimum wage in Germany?
We have something for you.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I don't eat pork.
Your arrival here was a mistake.
The newspaper publishes the profile of its new editor.
The procedure has failed since the beginning.
Why don't we get him a bottle of wine?
Five days after she finished, my daughter flew from Osaka Airport to Germany.
The boy laughs at the girl.
Please don't touch.

I need to get in touch with Tom.
I haven't bathed in three days.
Just close your eyes.
Let's make friends.

I'm gonna be young like you.
I was surprised how well Tom French speaks.
Tom lives a little further down the same street that Mary lives on.
The new teacher is in the classroom.

She's very tight and she's worried when she's at a party.
I think Tom's a good name.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
I heard what happened.
I like your shirt.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom may object.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think it's better to give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to provide good education for their children.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's thirsty.
You're leaving for London next week, aren't you?
I have plans for tonight.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You don't seem too surprised.
Obviously it worked.
I have to teach Tom this.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumped through the window.
Let me tell you, it's my fault.
Let me call you.
I gave them clothes and some food.
You're wearing your socks on the other side.
I'll be up early tomorrow.
You like French, don't you?
He almost ran her through the car.
Tom's not like them.
I left my credit card at home.
It's too hot.
You're bleeding.
I just want to be with you.
I want to learn French.
She's eating an apple.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the party.
Are you good enough?
Why don't you take a umbrella for each case?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm not right.
Are you done with breakfast now?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it again.
He arrived earlier than usual.
I talked to him about it on the phone.
I think you're very talented.
The flights were almost empty.
We need more research.
It's your responsibility.
Come to our guests.

I should have walked there because my car broke down.

How can I find you?
Nick owes me ten bucks.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Don't punish Tom for that.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom scored three points.
Do you like walking on the beach?
When will you leave?
Is there anyone with you?
Tom can't believe what's going on.
Is he having fun last night?
In fact, he's wrong.
They're already here.
Sit a man in the kitchen.
I'll give it back.
When does he close the art museum?

You're from Sweden.

Someone must have stolen your watch.
Tom grew up speaking French and English.
What are you doing now?
The museum deserves to be visited.
Tom's gonna be gone for a week.
I'm looking for a gift for my father.
The problem doesn't deserve to be discussed.
It was pretty cold.
"For here or at home?" "For here, thank you."
Bob came home very late.
The elevators don't work.
You want courage to do something like that.
Don't be afraid. You'll be fine.
I took her to town.
Anyway, you'll never understand.
Believe it or not, peach and almonds are from one family.
You want to hear something funny?
There's not enough chairs in the conference room.
I have no idea.
Tom wasn't perfect.
When I was a college student, I never slept the night before.

What's in your bag?
By the end of March, we'll be married.
He raised his hands.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Good luck.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He's married to a nice girl.
I took care of it.
Don't you show interest?
That's quite a different thing.
His brothers, his sisters, or he'll go to the station to meet his father.

Do you speak Turkish?
I put it in your room.
There's no one home.
He still wants to come.
We need to postpone the honor.

Why didn't you tell me beforehand?
I'll be back next week.
Stay with me, Tom.
The old man gave the child a cover.
I'll see you soon.

America needs you.
You have to decide.
I've seen a lot of tourists on the beach.

Are you registered?

I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor is slippery, be careful.

Come see us.
Looks like you've had a tough day.

But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe it at all.

The film wasn't as fun as the book.
The job didn't pull me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole called the Universe - part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of its consciousness. This illusion is a peculiar prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task must be to get rid of this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it embraces all living beings and nature in all and beauty.
He'll definitely come.
I know him.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.

I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to figure out when Tom's gonna go.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He's shooting at me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks of a change in the world, but nobody thinks of a change in themselves.

Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
I heard the shots.
I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.
Who did you translate this for?
If there's a desire, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel much better.
Are you done with the breakfast?
I've got some old computers.

You better not go.
I know what I want.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak French.
I'd like a shirt that fits this jacket.

The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.

I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother told me he's not afraid of the dark.
Tom really hates him.
The problem was I had nothing to tell him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do it.
Why don't you take off your coat?
Let's talk serious about your future.
I have a few calls to make, too.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind to close that window?
The old couple went on a journey around the world.

Be loving.
Yesterday was a terrible accident.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste your time.

Look carefully at the wall map.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.

Stop kneeling.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you've made a mistake.
He didn't stop him from staying up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.

I need to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.

I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak more slowly, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel so bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not only a necessity, but also a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's 11 now.
I'm running every day.
I think that's Tom.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Are you learning French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use a deodorant.
When you stand up to me, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never question his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not gonna take part in this.
You don't look too surprised.
This is a warning that we must take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you help us quickly?
Let's get our bags.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is practicing speaking French at every opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You've got nice hands.
People are against war as a whole.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's book?
That's never gonna end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's blocking you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
Who's hurting your tooth?
We learn French.
What makes you think so?
You were sitting in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
We teach French at school every day.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom looks lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was thirteen.
Her hobby is to collect postage stamps.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to speak more than we were to hear, we would be given two lips and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I'm holding your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you do it?
My father often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Aren't you afraid of something?
You didn't know anything about him since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I put my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you been talking to your sister before?
They're all hungry.
She came down the stairs.
I was alone, I learned.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think it's better for you to sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you have not paid for your neglect, please send the due amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet here.
I'm here for a break.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is being considered.
Tom was saved by a random passerby.
The village's in the center of town.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm terribly hungry.
It's very kind of you to turn away from your way to help me.
Tom decided Mary's story is interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of the city where Mary lives.
Now it's a little after eleven without a quarter.
Both statements are correct.
I haven't seen the dark before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep tonight.
The round lasted about five minutes.
He was around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I need to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.

I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, and what remains to be said.
I'll do my best.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that'll get me out of here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the girl's best friends.
Even when he was young, his parents died, so he was raised by his uncle.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't lie.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You've painted your walls, haven't you?
My mother teaches to arrange flowers.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it later.
I think you'll find it interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
One modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
The adoption of English is difficult.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is the place Tom was born in.
Where are you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I don't know how it's going.
You're all stupid.
They're exchanging gifts.
I don't mind myself.
Mr. How many Japanese food he started to like.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You need to focus on this fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first girlfriend.
Tom taught me to speak French.
Would you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find an account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to fix himself.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary's Tom's older sister.
I don't know either boy or boy.
The guests have to start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It was so nice to meet you.
This isn't your house.
I haven't seen anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary from the edge of the ladder.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Prepare for the worst.
Fruits of the rot under the sun.
She's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes at the checkpoint.
Time's on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It could take some time.
I thought you could take a look.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, car's coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take it with you.
Now I remember, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiles happy.
He's only four minutes from here by train.
What's he trying to achieve, Tom?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little fat.
I think it's better if we leave.
Tom said it probably won't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep your mouth shut!
I would never hurt them.
I've learned French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's two parents were teachers.
Children need to listen to their parents.
It's cloudy today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He returned home after he had been gone for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were interested in Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have a vein infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's happy with the results.
Hurry up and you'll be able to catch your train.
You won't need that anymore.
Put him back where he got it.
Let's start.
I fucked you.
Tom found out Mary was stealing money from the cash in the box.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So he did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's gone.
Do you think I'm so stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see it again, it probably deserved it.
This is Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision about it today.
She didn't have much money.
You've been sitting in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you learn French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year, we'll go to college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check account.
I thought Tom had a rest day.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of saying about DNA, but there's no one about RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind was blowing at the cracks.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter's married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of the 20 students, only one read the book.
I've got a job Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authorities.
I'm back home with the train.
I think I can do it in my spare time.
Are we going out?
They call me Bob.
What kind of situation would you have done that?
What was the name you were dating before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired and I want to lie down early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, I'm uncomfortable.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to the dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no television or radio at the time.
She went to a taxi museum.
Look at your job!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes on their heels.
Tom likes to puke.
You're a good doctor.
Don't say that again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him sometime.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He goes out with a group of kids he doesn't need.
It'll be fine if you don't get involved in personal affairs.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My veins bleed every time I use the end of my teeth.
We arrived fast because the movement wasn't loaded.
You need to be careful.
What are you missing?
He came back soon from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom doesn't help me.
I haven't been in contact with him for a long time.
Those glasses are on your way.
What'd you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until you get it.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
I don't care about these pair of shoes.
Is there something you're afraid of?
I have two cousins.
The list falls in the fall.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the council.
Since when did Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hi, I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand Uygur sentences in Tatobeba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't delay the collection.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cut through here.
I know this is hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
You think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
Hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thank you.
I felt like I was rejected among these people.
I think you'll have a good time tonight.
Don't take it away yet.
I'm sorry I'm interrupting you.
The fact that he's too generous is his biggest flaw.
Press the Shift key.
You understand, don't you?
Jane was always acting like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know him.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't matter.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new visits.
I'm thirsty.
The flowers are boiled without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
You see, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Find out what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
The problem is not that.
Go meet him and in the meantime release this letter.
This chicken hasn't worn any eggs lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom can't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Yung had nothing to do with me visiting her unexpectedly.
You have nice lips.
A lot of people are going to lose their jobs because of the bending of the car industry.
He came to my aid.
We're going to start landing in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's over.
The moment of fame for Hanshin didn't last long.
Is there a big house?
Wouldn't that lead to trouble?
He's confused that he's called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he fail the exam?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What are the results?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I think I'm lucky.
Tom could've lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I wasn't feeling well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pie on the front of the kitchen window to make the truth come true.
Happy is the man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He always tells the truth.
I can't live that way anymore.
Ah, how sad!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Is it good to taste?
Will you go?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth into two halfs.
It was personal.
Doesn't he interest you?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good to have a little rest.
When did you start learning French?
She cut her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it'll fall today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where'd you throw them away?
So, how's he gonna deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This is Tom's camera, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
Uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for the delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My friend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Measure this sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago I got in touch with them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad's driving very well.
We need to protect our children.
See you later.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encourage them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I'm planning on going to France.
Please unravel the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Badshrase and get down to Zeiszrase.
Smile is useful for your health!
It's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom everybody told me about.
Add this site to Favourites.
When the sun of culture is low, even the jujuts throw a big shadow.
When's the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He was sitting on his porch.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a date at the mall.
I'm not going to face threats.
You're in a better shape than I am.
Do you have a gondola?
I hope it's for the best.
He tried it himself.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's staying awake till late.
Tom's fine.
I'm walking like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I get you a knife?
You have to report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you had told me earlier.
Don't look in the camera.
Okay, but we'll go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were many people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret it.
I thought Tom would cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want something to eat.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even get the water to boil if I want to burn a chicken.
What's the name of this river?
Is she free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In the winter, the sixies are covered with ice.
There's hardly any time left for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm already full-time.
I want to go.
Give it back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want a orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I won't be surprised if Tom left earlier.
Tom speaks French as French.
I think we should make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket box?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need that.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I got a little tighter while I was dancing, and I got up on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I'm gonna get Tom to smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking the wrong way.
Tom has the right to know.
Your wind.
She took her exam.
I'll study in the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do it?
I've met him before.
Tom didn't give up.
Tom wasn't in danger.
I made a few mistakes on the exam.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was that?
I have to get him out of here.
Can I do something to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's already a grown man.
Let's not lie.
I'm fine.
It's not an art.
I didn't see you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
Did you hear about him?
She sent the blouse fast.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Tom really wants to win?
My grandfather really likes to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, darling.
Tom had a one-on-one wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night and Alice on Saturday night.
Looks like he's gonna fall.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read in French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
Letter card.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
I'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time
Men get in shape by driving a bike.
This isn't the end of history yet.
Don't rush.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Bring me a dry cloth.
Jim's name is James.
Are there other hotels you can recommend to me?
This bike belongs to me.
Fuck you!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Ann's a little girl.
Just press your fingers.
I went to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
I'm sorry.
I don't wear ammo.
You're my best friend.
I've arranged a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French texts?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move with you.
She's become twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What can that mean?
They come from Sweden.
Watch out when you cross a loaded street!
A man has to work.
That's fascinating.
What's your nationality?
That part's good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's getting caught.
They're looking forward to city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came in with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat sushi.
Throw out those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was surrounded by panic attacks.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say that.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check the upstairs.
Tom travels first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking a rest day tomorrow.
I didn't even say that.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you do that?
I think that's enough.
You told me that again.
It's been six years since I started studying English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Would you help me translate this?
Tom almost doesn't understand anything from French.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This climate is costing a lot of electricity.
Don't connect to this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be lifted.
First the good God made man, and then the woman made him. Then he had mercy on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that sound familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What kind of money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost over.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoy's dancing.
Today, machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please, start right now.
I've seen your driver's book.
Where's my room?
Tom suffers from flatulence.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human stupidity is infinite," I say, and because of this self-criticalness, I think it's an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the French letter.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't come to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Would you like that, Tom?
The whole show's going uphill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were back as they were.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth pulled last week.
The more you run, the more tired you get.
Don't hide how you feel about it.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open my door?
The girl is Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure this won't be necessary.
Tom's sick a lot.
The key doesn't go into the key.
What's the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom turned the lamp on again.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating angry.
Choose what you like.
Go there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
That's not from me.
When my father found out that I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we'd have dinner together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
She put on her sweater.
Sometimes I'm done with my money.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with such bad veins, she barely even has teeth.
I haven't seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a nice little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try the dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself leaping from one rock.
Where are you born?
These clothes look good on you.
They went straight to their goal.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's ring.
Do what you think is right.
Don't you fall in love with Tom?
Permanentity is paid off.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't make it.
Get ready for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being monitored by extraterrestrial intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My father walks in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each one of them a piece of flour.
Don't rush me.
I think you should let your beard go.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another drink?
A lot of people share my view.
The shirt's clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He's finished his big start at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court to be filled, but a fire to be set on fire.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Put the word in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I do.
I'm gonna hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was walking.
I saw the girl among the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, but we can't speak German.

I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and I kept it open for Mary.
We make cheese and butter from milk.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I didn't mean that.
I'm on vacation this week.
If a sick woman burns a thousand paper jars, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you at all!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
Take a look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They're drinking tea in the hall.
Tom set the engine on fire.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Burn 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you been talking to him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it off?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're guys.
Bad weather has prevented us from leaving.
I'm learning French now.
Because I didn't know where to get off, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm so busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're in the winning series.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The broadcast of television has greatly deprived us of our time for reading.
I'll need it forever to explain everything.
Don't fuck with me in the basement.
The new coroner is very infected.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're on your way to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm unofficial here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here till 2:30?
Tom taught me to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a toasted cup.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He's following English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me a lot.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired and I want to lie down early.
I love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people know how to talk well, and others are good listeners.
I didn't get the last word.
No matter how rich she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom was on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can also speak Russian.
Japan has many distinctive features.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking with the dog tonight.
What's your blood group?
Ten houses were burned.
I shouldn't have let you do it alone.
Sentenced to death.
I've been waiting for just five minutes.
Will you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borch" and "schi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's got his knees sucked.
I'll come back with you to the hotel.
Give me some milk.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Are you wearing the driver's book?
I don't need your help.
He's in front of the door.
My business is getting back together.
The keys are on the table.
I went to the park.
He reported the police disaster.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't spoken to anyone today except Tom.
I can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks the average amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're wearing your socks on the other side.
We just got information from your brother in Kansas.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's it really about?
Take care of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're interrupting.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are very expensive.
GDP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything in there?
Everyone was at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as bad as the cold.
Aren't you afraid, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV, too.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
Sometimes he's watching TV.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
They're only 30 minutes away from leaving the train.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope we'll talk soon.
Our arrival here was a mistake.
Don't hit us so hard.
Her hobby is to collect postage stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be okay.
That's what Tom won't understand.
Don't forget to get yourself a kitchen allowance like knives and cooking dishes.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised myself I'd never do that again.
Jane runs to school sometimes.
I think you'd like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen the koala?
Tom can't believe Mary really loves him.
I can't buy you this dress.
I think you panicked.
He went out to spend it.
I hope you're right.
At least 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My plans for the holiday failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think it's true.
I lost my sense of time.
He thought it might be a number.
He's the greatest poet ever.
What's your problem?
I'll visit my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and nobody loves anyone.
Tom wrapped his knee.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report on this.
You're pretty good with French, aren't you?
He postponed the holiday.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They got five peppers.
Do it for me.
"How are you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Get the car in the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
I saw his father fight.
Keep your room clean and neat.
I had a rough night.
She didn't like her husband.

Can you ride a horse?
Tom's very interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
It's Copacabana!
Maybe it's true, but I don't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Look how I do it.
We're going to a movie.
He often goes to a movie with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was stopped.
I'll be with you if you go and do it.
What's the name of the hotel in Boston he stayed in last year?
That's a complicated problem.
Now it's exactly 10:00.
It's like a rock.
Are you an Ergen, too?
He's known as a great poet.
We're not gonna be here after 2:30.
I saw Jesse standing there.
I bought books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I like sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't get Tom to understand.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed the door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like this before.
Open the bottle, please.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest introductions to medicine are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I have no interest in doing this.
Tom thinks he's gonna fall.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it off as lost.
I've been waiting three days.

Did you count the tiles?
You have to find a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
Many scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't.
You're a good singer.

Speaking of travels, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.

He's training his children well.
I was just being kind.

I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She looks a young man shy.
It's made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I sleep a lot.
Be more precise.
I was on vacation.
No one will understand.
Tom goes out drinking every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put his belt on.
You think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy put all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied him up to the chair.
I'm young.
The city is big.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Have you already done your duty?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom stays firm.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I drink water.
Don't worry.
Tom's not good lately.
I have to tell you something first.
One coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have another choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the name before the family first, and then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy was blind to his father's appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop because of me.
How do you distinguish them?
Time's on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't give 'em that much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has alcohol problems?
Will there be anyone at the station to meet me?
I haven't heard it in months.
I'm not playing both.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
This question is something I understand.
Why aren't you here?
Tom's the man who gave me this bike.
We're not going to burn ourselves under tyranny.
Tom is a complete mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom is so angry.
I'm so glad to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you pull this off?
Who's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
I didn't even say that.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here alone?
Do you have any subjects who speak French?
I don't need to speak French much.
Ask him about the way to the station.
Bill's going fishing in a day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I'm giving up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works in a wine cellar.
Tom had nothing to do with it.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want attention.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at 6:00 in the morning.
I feel uncomfortable with her.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
The staphids are dried grapes.
I was in India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of possibilities.
We were driving when we changed.
If you want something, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He's playing baseball after school.
The sound of the horrible sand made him shake.
Do you have this shirt in black?
It wasn't a celebration.
Amy ordered a new dress.
I saw you on TV.
Meg's talking too much.
I've put down a lot of stuff.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no room for concern.
We have physical.
Are you having fun yesterday?
This sweater is worth over $50.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their name.
That's for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in service.
I have an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Spread your shirts before they smack.
I'll be there.
Don't get too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
His investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
This book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I went on Highway 58.
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Take off your shirt, please.
I almost forgot it.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a serious fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I don't have anything.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign brands.
I was laughing.
It's hard to explain.
We're on our way to Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You're drinking from my watch.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's the job going?
I've written a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone is a comfort.
Are you selling French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom went there to learn French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I couldn't get along with the lighthouses.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom is very modest.
Thank you for that.
The ball, the turquoise panic, you drive the vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school Tom's planning to enroll.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We have a lot of lotus lists.
We are firmly convinced that when I make up the sentences, the author must avoid succumbing to the harmful habits of using too many unnecessary words, which are actually absolutely excessive in the light of the whole sense.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move," make your way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When does it end?
It's coming to me every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we'd make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He couldn't pass the exam.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep while reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm not a king.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom's staying.
It's too expensive!
Bye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two pounds of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that close to your home?
Jane filled out a statement.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
Fools run where angels are afraid to walk.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been dealing with sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you allow me in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've waited so long for it to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say things like that when there's kids around.
He pushes easily.
I want to improve my French speech.
You won't believe what I heard.
I'll teach Tom.
Today the train is ten minutes late.
Silence has occurred.
Are you sure you want to do that?
She didn't like him.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go to a meeting.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom right now.
Checkmate's not opening.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct an inquiry into the date of the test.
Maybe he's running away from the obvious.
Everyone's dying.
Tom is a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll listen to your advice.
A few days ago my computer stopped working.
In Japan, almost every family has a laundry.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The raven's flying away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly do you do, what the scope of the study is, your main interest.
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hello to Tom.
I think Tom may be drunk.
I've had a lot of heads.
Why don't you sleep?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's little chance I can't make it to the meeting.
He always said hello with a gift.
How do I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read pretty well.
Tom's okay, isn't he?
She showed up for a while in the paper.
J.F. Kennedy was buried in the cemetery in Arlington.
I'm not giving up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He'll get to the Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been very bluffing lately. My favorite football team is west.
I could easily relate to the sweet stories.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what I saw that night.
I've studied French for three years with a native of French.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there while it's still light.
Tom's hurt.
His room is a mess.
They set aside part of their time to take care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom's going to leave.
Ask Tom.
Let go of the radio.
I'll be staying for three more days.
We delayed the departure for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with a lot of things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have to come.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laugh.
I totally wiped it out of my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't enter the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims very fast.
Add this site to "Privacy".
I have a lot to say on this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what affects you.
The worst part is that it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were empty, and the man soon died.
I noticed you weren't at your house last night.
He's threatening us.
You want to buy this sex.
He's a great brain surgeon.
Last month, I was right.
He can speak French.
Are you leaving?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They set up the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've spent days in French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
Either he or I'm wrong.
You learn French, don't you?
The girl used to play alone.
He's playing in a group.
Birds sing.
Tom's doing his job at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was terrible, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
That's how you like it.
The time will come when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they get to the museum by bus?
Is he your teacher?
Watch out for him.
Be right.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a golden rule: whoever has the gold, he sets the rules.
The house is inhabited by spirits.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that isn't forever is forever old.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom make his home.
Can I help you?
You don't always agree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I don't care.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
That's a beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty good.
Say hello to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not have basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated from philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give some of the work to younger servants.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you do, you can't make a person believe in something, even less yourself.
I don't feel very good.
The climate doesn't work.
You're sitting in my seat.
Wouldn't something scare you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm freaking out when I think about it.
I paid two dollars of taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it because of you.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving up on a little bit of that watch, and not even talking about sharing with him permanently.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you're gonna do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made some egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
In the summer, I bath every morning.
Lock up your shirt.
Read it again.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't arrive for his speech in time.
I prefer grapefruits in front of oranges.
This place deserves to be visited at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister smoothed her shirt.
I told you that again, didn't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like a orange juice.
From the moment I took your book until I left it, I was always freaking out with laughter, and one day I'm gonna start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter narrowed down for the round.
And that's what I've seen.
The dolphin's kind of a trapper.
What color are these?
He shook his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be dragged.
I'm not taking drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, he ceases to be peace.
She built the room with beautiful furniture.
Job calculators can buy at the price of a pair of socks, and thousands of British kids are needed at school, not less than a pencil and a tire.
This is the hospital Tom was born in.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered their eyes.
This is my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop kneeling.
You can't just walk around and abuse people like that.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'll borrow money.
She's cooking for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the cold time when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this kind of thermos.
Tom runs around like a chicken without a head.
Greece is an ancient country.
A few people visited the meeting.
He put on his coat and got out of the house.
The new site of Tatobeba will pop out a home "hyper" database built by the basics search engine, and it will go to the Tatoebux-OS server with a dad's CPU made entirely of Tatobeii.
The old man stopped her.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it very much.
I've never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of the king.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What are you doing?
During my vacation, I read all Milton's work.
What are you going to recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I haven't seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't rush to protect me.
Who's Greece's capital?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Look where you're going.
They described the girl as a little bit.
Tom's not used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting too much sugar on it.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
The man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden went down.
They made us work all day.
We chose him as president.
No cannons?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I'd have told you.
What's the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you have to choose between piano and violin, which one would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
That's good.
That kind of thing is scary.
I think it's better to lie down.
I like you so much.
I called the phone.
The wolves are moving to the hummingbirds.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
Sunday, the museum is closed.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't give up.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
That guy's stable.
I almost won.
That wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I saw you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're dealing with this in the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have a little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved dramatically in relation to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems faced by young people.
We've finally met. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little bit more?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary holding his hand.
I think we should study things.
So we all agree.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie is really good for you.
I think you'll be a great father.
There's no way to contact him.
Don't ever give up.
Would you show me that bag?
That's my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come to nine?
Let's synchronize our watches.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a free shop?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
And if I'd told you, Kelfada.
This is the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Make sure you don't lose.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It looks like a man far away.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I have to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter who told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not hurry.
My father went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make quick conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is the milk of adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I dream of nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found that Mary had disappeared.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I'm back home with the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Ouch!
That's why you didn't want to come with me?
Did you decide what you want to order?
I put the boy in a deep sleep.
She called it what she called it.
Are we capable of that?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should have opened my trunk.
We discussed cancelling the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were stuffed with cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
The kids are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated Tom.
Keep moving.
It's a challenge for me, and I learn a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I was counting on her.
Don't look, Tom.
I have to pay for him.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we're gonna make it in time.
Being a troll is an art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodybuilder.
The man eats bread.
He's crossing the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my regards to your family.
When someone indirectly sent a message to a bottle, it was just a childish fantasy. When Christopher Columbus sent a message to a bottle, the fate of a whole country is set on a map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
Kids play dojball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean your room.
I tried to be human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Tom really wants me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums have you visited?
I waited as long as possible.
He crept into the room without taking off his coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th, and Muriel's birthday.
