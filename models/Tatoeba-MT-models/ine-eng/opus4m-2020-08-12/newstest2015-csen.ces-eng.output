Petr Czech: A transition to the last moment?
It's all possible.
Today is the last day you can still skip the transfer window and make a big break.
Next chance comes in winter.
Petr Čech, currently replaces Chelsea, but now he is not sitting above a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits at the NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is going to Czech representation at the US General and then also at the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea branch, in the new season Premier League, Thibaut Courtois, Czech for the first time in ten years in the London club got into the position of deputy.
Previously it was speculated that the Czech might be interested in Real Madrid.
In the beginning of the season, the Spanish Superpower lost in combat with the Athletics, and he couldn't even enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It also speculated about the interest of Paris SG.
The one in the season of the French League had two victories and two remises, shot St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressing shoe club AS Monaco.
He's got 1-1-2 in the league and he split up with Lille on the weekend slowly 1:1.
The news on the Bulgarian English websites today is that the Czechs might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, though, Chechnya's departure from Chelsea at the last moment is not too likely.
Skybet wrote a 4:1 course on him.
Peter, is it possible you'll change your dress over the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything in the football.
Maybe during the day there'll be an offer that won't be rejected.
How would such an offer look?
(Laughter) "Well, I still don't know how an offer that can't be refused actually looks.
It would have to come to the agreement of all parties, especially if Chelsea would decide whether or not to offer a club.
Is it technically feasible to commit such an offence when you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in a new position?
So I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation there are many players today, all of them are somewhere on the scene, and certainly today there are many more crimes to be closed.
So somehow feasible, it would certainly be.
How many clubs on the planet could you afford?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing out?
The situation when I didn't catch a new season in the first three games is new to me after fifteen years of my career.
Still, there's no reason to panic, pack and leave.
I want to continue my fight for Chelsea's bankruptcy position and he's on a coach who chooses what decision he'll make in the coming weeks.
What role does family play in your decision making?
I take all the factors into account.
It is important for me, of course, to have a sports perspective, but I am also looking at it from the personal page, which of course belongs to the needs of the family.
Is it possible you'd catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought it would never concern me.
But it's possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Police in Carrata after a motorcycle chase arrested a 20-year-old young man
The engine was stopped after the zone with a maximum permitted speed of 70 km/h and drove 125 km/h to the bush to avoid the police.
In the morning, the traffic police in Carrata tried to stop at the end of the engine when they noticed that when they left the pump station at Bathgate Road, they drove 125 km/h.
According to the police, the driver didn't stop and continue on Burgess Road and then he got into the bush, so the cops lost him out of sight.
The engine and the person who matched the driver's description were then seen in the house at Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karath police accused a 20-year-old of disobeying the call to stop and take care of him.
Before the court in Carrata, September 23rd.
The bike was fun for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be brought before the court for charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was charged with being heard by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
Supposedly on June 7, 2013, the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in the district of Perthshire had raped a woman.
According to Webster, she was attacked while “she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent.”
In addition, Webster is charged with rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn at the Scottish Highness on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of the review on 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Renewal of a very American idea that labour rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect civil rights organisations in the committees.
"According to the functioning of the committees, jobs for the middle class are functioning," says Ellison, Democratic Senator for Minnesota, who is co-chair of the Congress Committee.
That is why I am so proud that I can, together with John Lewis, present a law to strengthen the position of employees.
This cross-border legislation gives workers the same legal opportunities as preventing discrimination in the organisation of committees as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop the anti-committee forces.
The regulation of the Labour Relations Act in such a way that it allows all employees who face discrimination if they want to get involved in committees, to be tried by the civil court - and to award compensation or compensation - is a proper and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other law designers are proposing is to reintroduce the American ideal.
Even through the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them when the country, with one breath, prosecuted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their committees played a role in the formation of a new Japan, included in their languages and openly recognized that “the right of employees to meet, to negotiate collectively and to act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged Germany to create a constitution to ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler will be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees in the new nation would need to organize and promote, and therefore included a clause that openly states: “The right to create companies that ensure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements which will restrict or attempt to harm this right shall be repealed. The measures leading to the fulfilment of that purpose shall be unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, President of the International Commission on Human Rights, proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, included the proposer and the Roosevelt guarantee that “every person has the right to establish and enter committees within the framework of the protection of his interests.”
The whole American generation has accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil society and a democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create working committees - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to go back to the American idea that workers must have the right to organize and promote themselves in free and open societies.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone today knows that the forces of the nation have not diminished, but they have expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and brought production to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack the councils forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of committees - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have lifted up America and made it a real promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law, which could have closed all waste clinics in Louisiana
On Sunday, the federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisian law, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five clinics for losses in the state.
A regulation signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors to accept a patient in a hospital up to 30 miles away from their practice.
The judge’s ruling means that doctors may continue to perform legal executions temporarily and must, in the meantime, take care of this permit.
"The proposed party will be able to carry out its activities legally and, in the meantime, to obtain permission," says Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled for one month so that the judge can issue a more lasting resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to dispose of the resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
"This decision ensures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from a paramilitary law that is to prepare them for health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who on behalf of three of the five clinics claimed to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerns doctors from two clinics who were not among the complainants and also requested permission.
Louisiana is among the eleven States that have adopted similar laws, and the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures to be anti-constitutional.
Key parts of the Texas Act, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's right to abstinence with the Association of American Relatives and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association claim that the need to have this permit puts on a doctor the requirements that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
The resistance to the loss was rejected by the measures aimed at protecting women’s health, and some also welcomed the closure of the clinics because of the measures.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights has indicated that only one doctor is authorised to perform losses in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop the execution of the losses, the doctor would also stop the procedure with fear of safety, the group said.
The Louisiana authorities have indicated in their response that they would not punish doctors who perform losses while waiting for a claim to be granted.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer is more common
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their deceased mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at greater risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of the five years after diagnosis lived.
Susan Jordan’s QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, leading research, said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIES: New medicines can slow lung and ovary cancer
Women’s researchers have been watching for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival affected the age of women during diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was observed in older women diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors may be late diagnosis and poor treatment availability.
"The disease can best treat gynecooncologists who usually live in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving medical services at a distance to overcome a remote barrier, the doctor suggested that it help strengthen transport services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of the geographical position, stressing the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
Research funded Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer today will publish the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at 33 years of age, the young mother of Elisha Neave from Gold Coast was diagnosed with the aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Gardening centres regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, a decrease associated with the extraordinary loss of owners of households under 35 years of age could lead to a further 10 million pounds a year by today's young generation of consumers reaching the "main age groups of gardeners", garden centres will come to up to ten million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent their homes lose their gardens on average 55% of the amount lost in their homes.
As other dangerous factors in the sector, which makes an estimate of five billion pounds a year, it indicates an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the form of adhesion instead of the suburbs used as a parking area and the size of the gardens decrease.
In the area of Great London, where the proportion of households owned fell from 6 years of age from 61% to 43%, they account for one household the lowest expenditure on garden products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society have stated that housing in the basement or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardener for the RHS, said: "The tenants have a very popular plant growing in flower plants - when they move, plants can take with them."
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of home owners and economic prosperity lasting from 80 to half the 1990s.
Also this year he predicted a higher decline due to better weather conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator talks about democracy.
After Putin at the meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me of Hitler's most important thing, he saved himself with atomic weapons and basically revealed to everyone that their opinions were stolen from him, gave us today a lecture on democracy.
But I have such a feeling that the current regime in Russia is showing a lot of pictures of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and it is that they can be dominated by both the tainted nationalism, and that the complex of minorities can transform them into imperialist cowardice.
Time is obviously different from the east than the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of wars over Europe was long gone, in the east it thought that they had been overlooked for a long time and it was necessary to regain their international position.
This was the mood and frustration of the German government in the 1930s, just before the Nazi power was captured, and then followed the outbreak of nationalism that is not the same today in Russia.
And then this completely consistent cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is certainly quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and most of the Russians are likely to be in a straitjacket when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled before them.
Perhaps the Western politicians blamed themselves, perhaps few of Vladimirs were crying on his shoulder, perhaps not inviting him where he wanted and perhaps starting to underestimate him, and he was just acting like a typical Russian man.
He made the order at home, he looked like he didn't even want to, and he threw a knife at home.
Now he decided he'd get a lost position.
It's starting slowly, it's time.
The leader's probably in life, so where he'd hurry.
The Kavkasanas are fucked, now the Ukrainians are killed, then there are a number of Pobaltians.
Those Russian bears have been in the skin for a long time.
He's definitely gonna notice that, too, China, which kind of jumps out of the way, and he's definitely making a run for the Far East.
And the Germans of the Vladimir are also pretty sick of how well they are, and I put that on their ass in 45.
What to do is do one new New Yorker in Karl's Varek.
That would be a base and ours are many there and how they're printed there, and the douchebags already wanted to get rid of them.
For our veterans so far remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, let's say that their prime minister, Mr. Sobotka, is so soft, he can run like a towel and shoot the whole EU.
That's how it would play to jump on big Russia.
They need to remember where they are.
And as cracks, we'll use our cousins who live in their territory.
There's plenty of Russians everywhere, and if they say they're printing them there, they're just printing them, and we don't let that happen, we're protecting them.
And again, the Russians will rule, for what else is he born.
But Europe is good only as a suggestion on which proud Ivan can dance a goat.
Turkey summoned an American diplomat for a spy report
The Turkish Foreign Minister has called on the country's highest-ranking American diplomat to explain the report on American and British spying activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the US cargo d'affaires and Turkish state officials acted on the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to the documents provided by the former American National Security Agency analyst, Turkey was the priority target of American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has embroiled the importance of the report and declared that all important states are following each other.
An older report, which said that the German news service was also focusing on Ankara, called for a more frustrated reaction by the Turkish government.
The series The throne game presented the next tricks of the fourth row
The creators of the Throne Games are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they were proud of the fourth row of tricks.
The most visible are computer adaptations of the serial environment and mass scenes, when the army of the famous Daenerys becomes from the noise of the soldiers.
Police Director in Magaluf Accused of Corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence to the Office of the Mallorian Public Prosecutor on the expulsion of police officers and civil servants from a councillor in the Calvia area.
The chief of police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after the accusations of the proud businessmen and bar owners in an unpopular party district in Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was arrested after he was charged with corruption by several businesses from Punta Ballen, a street in which most bars and night shops are located in Magaluf.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday, prosecutors of the Mallorca Office for the Suppression of Corruption filed evidence of expulsion from police and civil servants of a councillor in Calvia's own jurisdiction.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police for their linkage with the corruption charge and they were heard by the judge along with Navarre.
The Spanish national journal ABC quoted the unsatisfactory owners of overnight businesses as having a significant impact on their business on the benefit of public operators.
"It's not about making money long ago, it's about survival," one of the entrepreneurs said in court.
Don't play with our pet.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf came to the world’s main page of magazines after a video of 18-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, who provided oral sex to 24 men during a tour after bars.
Since then, island authorities have been trying to keep an eye on drunks and diners in a number of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious alcoholic tours by bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where there was an event involving oral sex provision, was forced to close for a year and, together with the tour operators after the Bars of Carnage, pay a fine of EUR 55,000 (US$ 73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is popular especially in Britain, was also a witness to many accidents under the influence of alcohol including fashion waves known as "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
First spring day marked by rain and storms that had an impact on flight at Adelaide airport
JARO brought South Australia an ice surprise, with a strong rain and strong winds that seriously hit Adelaide airport.
Another 5 mm impact should occur in the city up to nine hours in the evening and another 6,6 mm will occur during the night of the week.
The last rain was seen along with a few short surges associated with the storm and the wind blowing that began at eight o'clock in the evening, and during about ten minutes brought about 4 mm of precipitation.
After a few springtime doses had arrived in winter last week, the temperature in the city had dropped again on Monday at only 15.8 °C.
It is estimated that storm weather contributed to the late Virgin Airlines arrival from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed a moment after 19:30, but for a short distance it was hit by a change of speed or direction of the wind and was forced to postpone the landing.
The wind blowing at Adelaide airport at that time reached the ground at a speed of about 50 km/h.
The flight data showed that the plane had to leave from the second landing and finally reached about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently led to further delays, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Qantas from Sydney.
According to the forecast, temperatures in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday and may result in one or two surgeries.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas attacked their homes with rockets and mines. However, schools in Gaza remain closed, while the territory is remembered for fighting.
The beginning of the school brought to the community in southern Israel marked attacks of joy and excitement, but the signs of battle are still visible.
In Ashdoda, a town in the south of the country, the school staff that hit the rocket removed the remains from the wall after the strikes, and the children are expected to return.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a citizen of Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, discovered that "it's a little strange" to go back to school all of a sudden.
"We've been through a few difficult moments and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the ceasefire last week of the war ended, thousands of border residents like Saad stayed inside their homes or homes left and moved to safer areas away from Gaza to avoid rockets and mines.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, where she shot a four-year-old boy from the Palestinian Minomet, with a return of weight.
The Minister of Education said that about twelve families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
The President of the government of Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderota, a city on the border with Gaza, which was hit by a Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, and he said, “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace last Tuesday.
The ceasefire, however, led to the immediate end of the fighting, but did not solve key problems such as the demand of Hamas to end the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the restoration of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the arms of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers who fell in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to start later this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of the Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts and estimates that at least half of those killed were radical, although there is no clear evidence for this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4 591 rockets at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country, and fired mines.
The Israeli army has again made more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and the estimated 250,000 people hid in hundreds of UN schools, which turned into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and because of ongoing fights, school officials dropped off last week at the beginning of the school year.
"I hope they will soon open the school so that we can complete our education as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in the largest city of Gaza.
I'm standing behind Vácho.
A Lafatu hits the temperature
The Czech football team met in Prague this afternoon before the mid-term preparatory match with the United States and the next start-up of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Three-hundred-and-twenty-six-year-old has problems with the Spartan attacker David Lafat, who is suffering from fever.
David isn't here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David has a little more problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," Coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it will be two or three days, or tomorrow it will fit, it will be seen according to his health status that our doctor will decide on," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has a disease, but it is not such that they could not train or participate in the match on Wednesday with the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan treasurer Lukaša Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision-making process, considering other middlemen.
I decided on the basis that Lukas is a perspective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I am behind it," Vrba said to Vách.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Latata.
It is not excluded that, in the case of health problems, the appointment could still change.
For example, on the weekend with a great performance, the Liberian Josef Šural gave a hattrick.
Of course, they're players who've been showing the shape lately.
We'll see how David Lafat is doing.
In case there is no access on Wednesday, I do not claim that I can nominate any of the players interested in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon there is a performance of training in Fear, then on Tuesday, a classic prefabricative training before a duel with the US on Summer, which will be open for fans and followed by autographs.
Fighting with Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for a premium victory under Vrba.
In the previous three preparatory games, he won two remises and lost once.
The qualification match with the Netherlands is then scheduled for 9 September from 20:45.
Walking in the Netherlands to Italy
The wolf likes to have more time to train than the previous strikes.
It is an advantage when you have players eight days and you can practice with them certain things that we may not have had so much time before.
Now we will only be able to focus on getting ready for the Netherlands as best we can," Vrba commended himself.
The Dutch will present themselves on Thursday in Italy before the attack in Prague and the duel will be personally monitored by the former temporary representative viewer Josef Pešice.
He gives us the information that's from the fight.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a game and we're going to take it apart.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, and we will see what changes there will be," Vrba said to bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to highly monitored statistics, the prices of the apartments in the winter period have grown at most in the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital, RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic grew by 1,1 % in August, as indicated by the agency on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase of 4,2 % in June, June and August, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice as much as in one year by August 2013, but profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
The Director of Research RP Data Tim Lawless has indicated that Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
The RP Data figures show that the prices of the apartments in Sydney increased by 16,1 % last year, while the prices in Melbourne by 11,7 %.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra, which has damaged the state's ordered cost reduction and where prices have only increased by 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that when spring began, the number of real estate for sale will increase in the following months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Because of the continuing high sales of auctions, the overall high sales rate and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of the accommodation will be even higher over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, who worked at the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry is testing comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melodies is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother died, Henry went through "defense" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face; you have only heard his voice: “Stop with that frame.
Leave the sister alone.
Get out!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were adults - went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass of beer or the beauty of a cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that.
Most of my life was a serious guy in a corner reading the paper.
Henry recently visited Dudley's library, and although conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life must have been for him.
There's more light out there today, but it's still a dark, smoked, cloudy labyrinth where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and sweat.
Dad always went into the bathroom, and he was just lying there, and then he was hearing how slowly he started singing for himself, because he was laughing at the gym.
When I went around, I realized that he was doing these years to enjoy his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry survived childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anybody, he didn't say, "I love you."
When Mom was sick and died, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, who has Dawn French, made it possible for him to enjoy the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn Franco.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With French, married for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had sugar.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of overweight, and the symptoms of sugar, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center and I also had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And boring.
Nobody wants to eat their own carrots.
Changes in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After he got credit for criticizing Othell, he drowned in the theater.
She followed the comedy full of mistakes and August Wilson's plots.
It's a different experience than sitcoma and comedy who have fulfilled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
The DJ noticed him on the stage on someone's parody, and wrote about him in the talent contest of New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-70s: “I was the only black impersonator/comicon on television for a long time.”
He was learning to walk.
In addition to having to notice the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to invent working jokes, be a star and perform on television, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Given that his manager owned the right to make the show The Black and White Minstrel Show, the fun program in which the actors dressed themselves as blacks, Henry finally appeared in his comedy for five years.
My family was already married for that.
I wish it never happened, but I don't like it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the darnel.
What was "years and years appreciated was the main product of British television", but was also "British parody of Blacks".
In the 1980s Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and presented figures that at the same time ridiculed and glorified British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show started broadcasting in 1984 and in the 1990s was also known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedy Series Chef!
For decades, he was picked up by advertisements, documents, television shows and roles in movies, but after sending his LennyHenry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said, "What you're going to do now, Len, seems a little bit like you're stuck in one place or you're getting a little out of the way."
Next in line was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach him at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of that.
All the people we were having a conversation with, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get into it when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all like Shakespeare.
Henry presented 20 lines of Othello's final speech for the document, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it's giving me the courage.
“It’s about it. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the trial was hard, and I've been reading the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
Looks like they're waiting for a thunderstorm, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in Comedy full of mistakes.
All of a sudden, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical problem and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for the public entertainment.
"The voice in my head said, 'Before the computer is fixed, you have to have ten minutes of fun.'"
Instead, the director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the theater and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can fix it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry v Plotech v Dutch Theatre
Learning the plot text was a challenge.
Panic's pretty good, it's making a decision.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like God's sign that says, "You should do this."
Of course it's said by the sound vote.
So I'm staying at it.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the experiment.
However, Henry remains the brain of the comedian - our entire conversation interrupts with humorous performances when he enters and exits the role of the simulator.
I've decided not to be a stand-up because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a blind alley.
Sometimes, if I want to, I do live at the Apollo, but I don't like it like before.
I was wondering if he'd ever set up a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in one room with the director who helps to draw pictures of the beginning, the means and the end of the road - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm having fun at acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to pay attention to non-existent employees
Kenya began biometric registration of all her state officials in order to try to remove the government's non-existing employee payroll.
According to the government's declaration, employees who do not register within the next two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people are paid even after the state service has left.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhur Kenyatta promised to ban corruption in state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state comes monthly at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) on payments of non-existent employees and other abuses of official power.
The government suspects that payments are still deposited in bank accounts even after the death of an employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, the BBC reporter from Nairobi, Wanyam Chebusiri, said.
All state officials shall be provided to the identification centres for the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, shall be indicated in the government's declaration.
He also says that anyone who fails to make an apology without a sufficient apology will be removed from the payroll.
"The establishment of real public service employees will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clean up the payroll on both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waigura, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested for "fighting" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers were detained in Turkey due to suspicions of "conspiracy against the government".
The police station has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 senior officials were detained.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organising a criminal gang and telephone interrogation.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then the president of the government) marked their actions as part of the actions of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gulen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important to families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the government president Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he informed the present journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that it was decided to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on 1 September.
Not all of Ukraine has peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at the school in Slavanska, visiting Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated so that children wear fancy shirts, bring balloons, and give flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a chief for difficult times
Take with you a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclusion of the conservative party.
She's got her own experience from the front lines.
She started her career in the Bain and Co consulting company, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years.
It's said that her distance was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Brown, former director of the BP when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: he became an adviser to the government.
Her husband is a former council member.
In May, I described the director's work as a pot of poison.
Not only is BBC an extensive and integrated entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside to the top layer of the hierarchy of its own BBC management, but also outside to the voice of the public in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly which calls for a thorough reform.
However, which director would risk coming to a company complex as a Chinese dynasty, disbanding it and preparing for work itself.
It's a difficult challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and how its status is revised.
With the expansion of the area of competition and the new technology questioning old security, the immediate negotiation of concessional fees for BBC is very dangerous.
For a modest amount of 145,50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the largest media company in the world.
BBC will tell a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of the household and costs only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the BBC's format is clearly higher: 53% of beneficiaries compared to 31% ten years ago.
The models for using BBC services have changed: Today, newspaper headlines are displayed on my mobile phone and on the shows I visited, I can watch iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims the insulting tweet didn't approve
Tweet from the official twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, published on Sunday, contained an insulting image of a democratic state agent who initiated Perry's criminal charge of abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published on Perry's account, which was distanced from the previous one.
He left my account with a tweet that was not authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and I pulled it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published a humorous picture of the representative of Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, which Perry, a potential candidate for the president in the 2016 elections, brought this month before the great jury in Austin.
The tweet stated: “I don’t always drive three times the level of alcohol in the blood... but if I do, I regret Governor Perry calling me responsible for it.”
I'm the hottest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
He was taken care of by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry was wanted innocent and accused of being a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team requested a judge to monitor the case to reject the charge, because the use of the laws to appeal to the governor serving the longest in Texas history is counter-constitutional.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the state fund for the protection of the public interest, which is based in Travis County and is reporting corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The refusal resulted in a formal complaint from the left-hand group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it celebrates.
After Perry finished his fifth place in his committee in 2012 in Iowa during his presidential campaign, Perry replied to the speculation that he might end up tweeting with his own photo, running near the lake, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to normal
One of the most prominent development companies in London has warned that the housing market in southeastern England has "returned" to the normal level of activity.
In June, the Bank of England adopted mortgage restrictions on the subject of high demand and rising prices and increased credit bubble concerns.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and president of the Berkeley Development Company, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market from the top point in 2013 has returned to the normal level of transactions." He adds that it provides a "stable environment for operation".
The London housing market did well during the decline, as buyers from abroad sailed to the capital.
According to the disaster data, only last year prices in the city jumped by 18,5 %, with an average of 6,7 % in England and Wales.
The average selling prices of private, affordable and student accommodation from Berkeley rose by about five last year and reached 423,000 pounds by the end of April.
However, because of the increasing books, they have not been so attractive to foreign buyers of London's real estate in recent months - some of them have also been intimidating the introduction of new real estate taxes and the possible "settlement taxes" with which policies came before the next May parliamentary elections.
The London Real Estate Office Foxtons warned last week that the April review of the mortgage market, which presented stricter rules for loans, would also slow down market growth during the second half of the year during the sale of properties and prices.
The new Bank of England data showed a decrease on Monday in the number of approved mortgages in June, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, has reduced its forecast of the increase in London real estate prices for 2015 by 3%.
The volume of transactions according to the real office of WA Ellis has decreased by one quarter in the most expensive London districts such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington each year.
However, the demand for housing in Berkeley's capital was a blessing because it increased cash for forward sales to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-looking accommodation in the right location remained the same and this kept the forward sale.”
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the end of the crisis in 2007.
The annual income before taxation increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before the annual meeting of Pidgley, Berkeley was expected to comply with the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual income before taxation will be 450 million pounds.
Berkeley's stock on the London Stock Exchange stopped at 23.96 pounds this afternoon.
Hacker on the Internet posted photos of our Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th anniversary of the Cen Academy.
The photos of Oscar Jennifer Lawrence's holder escaped on the Internet because of a hacker who claimed to have "list" photos of another hundred starters.
"Hunger Games" movie star confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are real and hacker criticised for "evident violation of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will report to anyone who steals photos of Jennifer Lawrence's public.
Hacker photos, which were originally published on the 4chan image sharing server, allegedly gained a gap in the Apple iCloud internet storage system. The data list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanny, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how authentic the photos are, however, the star of the movie "Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World" Winstead also criticised the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who look at the photos we and our husband shared in private homes years ago are satisfied with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the cable television series Nickoldeon "iCarly" and "Victorious", however, denied that the photos would be right. She said on Twitter: "These my alleged naked photos are PODVRH, people."
It's better to swallow it even in the crack.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that the speaker of the pop stars Ariana Grande denied that the pictures would be correct.
Extraordinary show from the famous new novel Howard Jacobson about love and the letter "J"
They got divorced, it's the best way to describe it, they're gradually spreading out like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
From time to time, a woman told him that she was too serious, complicated, fast, isolated, and perhaps a little sloppy.
And then she shakes his hand.
You've allowed this to happen.
He was able to pee like a goat, yeah.
The last victim of this ability was the beginning of a loving nurse who promised more than usually to relieve him of the loneliness of his life and perhaps to provide him with some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild warm hair and a flying heart from the village on the north island, which was even farther and less hospitable than Port Reuben.
The older company that Kevern thought was her aunt who inherited the property in a wet, but beautiful valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's been in the house for a few years.
The pipes were squeezing, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the crackers were squeezing themselves into windows, as if they thought that the place belonged to them, the garden was rusty, and the flower remembered the huge heads of the wild.
The house looked like a chalup from children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations at the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailin sat on the armchairs in the long grass and held their hands, enjoyed an unexpected warm spring afternoon, unaware of the public station that the country had provided with comforting music and soothing reports, when in this view he reminded him of the old song of a long forgotten Montenegrin comic, which he loved to listen to with the filmed hands of his father.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, such songs were no longer played on the radio.
They weren't forbidden - really nothing was forbidden - they just didn't play.
They helped them get to the desuetude, as well as the same word desuetude.
People’s tastes have proved what they would never have been able to do without the law, and like people with books, they choose memoirs in which the poor become rich, cooks and lovers of love, so they choose the ballads in music.
Kavern was allowed to spend the day and started playing at the imaginary piano and with a gruesome, comical voice sang the serenade Aillina's big feet.
Ain't no head.
"It was a favorite song by the jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to squeeze the letter out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he was playing the game with his father.
When you took the word that started at her, didn't have two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny anymore, and it wasn't funny right now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He must have explained what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard of anyone.
Neither did I, even though it wasn't directly built outside the law, they didn't play.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There was only one place in life for one "if."
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
That's the same in humor.
His unpredictability went to people's nerves.
And jazz was a humorous song.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior for up to ten years, Kevern knew jazz from his father's seminal collection of old CDs.
At least Alillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she could not remember the time when her favorite singers were not black.
Even without laws or pressure.
The voluntary society is one in which every part of it, with its gratitude - with the gratitude of those who were fortunately saved - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitutions threw for entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, like natural electronics supplies, took responsibility for not having a family without a functional phone.
The Poles that remained were the installers, the Greeks that remained, they washed the dishes.
Those of the states of the Persian Gulf and Levant whose ancestors did not leave the land quickly while doing WHAT IS STALO, KDYBY IS STALO - feared that they would be accused of putting them into the fire, actually feared that the fire would be spent the next time - opened the restaurants where the labs were sold and smoked the water pipes, ignored themselves and the inaction was feeding them slowly.
To everyone according to his talent.
Because she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn found it hard to understand how music could come from the loose words that Kavern just sang to her.
Music was the expression of love.
"They're not really free," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden provided illusions of security.
Behind the soundtracks, the word couldn't even be escaped.
Ailin still doesn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he managed to put two fingers in her mouth again in her presence.
She thought it was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he finally said.
Unbelievably, she shook her head and obscured Kevin's view.
There was nothing else in the whole world but the mess of her hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He was looking again.
She didn't go so far.
Maybe some rings...
Are you saying you hate me because I have too thick rings?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could've said "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are just attracting me," he tried.
I'm a little succulent.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lost the magic he needed to be able to break the cruelty he was shouting at.
Maybe his father was cruelly intentional.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel to Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomon's noise and she got out of bed, she hit the radio and poured unripe wine.
Uncooked wine, so he couldn't drink for it.
She seemed to shake herself like a palm leaf in a storm.
"It's weirdly attracted to me that you're a fool," she said...
Except it doesn't appeal to me.
She was sorry for both her unkind words and her fear in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did you think she'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but she didn't doubt that it was the same as it was here.
The same broad and ice-cream ocean was shaking over them.
The same contempt of men, then, WHAT IS STILL, is even more improbable and abhorrent than their ancestors, pastors and cassettes, angryly bloomed from the house to the house, prepared to stretch hands on any woman who would weigh them down to refuse them or tell them.
Stupid?
If he doesn't pay attention, they'll show her their fingers!
First of all, it became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote to the dark ballads of love that radio churned - first of all, it was anointed, then one killer.
According to Kevernov, excessive cultivation was due to the fact that anointing was about itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons literally suggested that he leave.
He got up from bed like an old man.
She felt frozen by herself, but she was surprised by the intensity of his grief.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched him leave - as if she were watching him out of the window on the ground - the man who was hit by what he did himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart went out to him and to all the men in general, regardless of what happened to her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders hung up, his shamed, his whole battle left him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she could not afford the only moment until today that she would ever see it?
Ailinn Solomon, herself, looked at her feet.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 20-year-old researcher working in Offnow, an unintended monitoring system of the Public Disposal, prepared a short article on the survival of minor and moderate violent acts in the areas of the country where its calming or direct stopping was most expected if enough money and energy were to be spent on removing it.
"It has done so much and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to calm down the innate aggression of people who have fought in many battles and most of them have won, especially in busy, difficult places in the country where even through the peaks of church towers coming out of the living areas of human kindness has historically only rarely appeared."
Some things, however, are irreplaceable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the pudding.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, boast of unhappy stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas, old brutality is held as firmly as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace, roads and even in sports games, there is new and aggressive intolerance.
"Unfortunately you tend to have too flowery style," said her superior.
I would suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum has turned her head.
I also have to ask myself: Are you an atheist?
"I have the impression that I do not have to answer," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme regained her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"I am not asking for it," said Rabinowitz, "that I should have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have any prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unaccompanied companies.
But a certain kind of sensitivity, which is completely acceptable and commendable on its own, can sometimes detract from the judgment as you presented it.
Obviously, you yourself are pre-connected to the church - things that you call "hard" and "brutish" could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural power and energy.
Keep solving what's happened, KDYBY'S IS. IT'S as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, it's preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the pink light table was a recommendation that Onnow sent to the world in the last quarter or more.
Smile to the neighbor, watch your partner, listen to the ballads, come to the musicians, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
It's better to talk than to keep quiet, the word sung is better than written, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your exception," replied the silent Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure that her superior had finished, "and I no longer argue that the wound was not healed as we believe it was healed.
My main concern is that if we are not previously aware of this, we repeat the same mistake that led to what's going on, KDYBY's going on.
This time, however, we will not fantasize about others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips.
It was meant to be endless patience.
"You start too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that may have been taken and may not have done your grandparents, you describe them as mistakes.
You're far too far away from talking about venting your "reception" and "infidelity" into "other".
I should not remind anyone in your place that we are not talking about "us" and "them" in understanding the past and in protecting our presence.
There were no "we" and there were no "them".
All we know is that it was chaotic times.
“In the course of which, if we are honest with ourselves,” Esme took courage, “we are not without guilt.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this together.
And just as there is no guilt that could lead to someone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the repair was appropriate and possible.
But what is the past except that We may learn from it?
There's a past to forget about.
If I can add anything to it--
Luther Rabinowitz unplugged his fingertips.
"I will take your report into account," he said and missed it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her in a walkway in a way that was described as “groaning and loud. ”
Accidents happen.
The army of the Lesotho kingdom claims that no coup is planned - the government's president remains in South Africa
Military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho protested that they would organize a coup for the purpose of overthrowing the government and claimed that they acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
The president of the government Thomas Thabane fled the country and said that the army surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maser.
After declaring he was threatened with death, the prime minister left his family in the neighbouring South African Republic.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's army said that it wasn't really a pimp, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics", which the police were trying to arm themselves.
"This morning the command of the defence components of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several reports from the information service that there are several groups in the ranks of police who are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who are going to set themselves up in the country," said the Voice of America.
The speakers of the South African government, Clayson Monyel, said that military action seemed like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that government power has been grasped by force, all the actions of the Lesotho defence components bear the mark of state coup," he said.
Military representatives of the Kingdom of Lesotho said that soldiers returned to their wives on Sunday and were at peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothejo Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane claimed that he believed he was the target of an attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane has suspended Parliament's meeting for internal disputes, Lesotho has been tense.
He declared that despite his false claims, he did not undermine his government's conduct.
Manufacture in the euro area shall be subject to a minimum of thirteen months
The growth of production was reduced to a minimum of thirty months, according to a carefully monitored survey in the euro area in August.
The final shopping manager index in the euro area (MIP) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7.
A number greater than 50 means expansion.
There were new orders and the factory damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia for Ukraine.
The figures come from a quarterly meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will require a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the far-reaching recovery of the euro area and the threat of inflationary deflation of 0.3%.
Speculation has emerged that the Director of the ECB Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to that of the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than any growth, the braking effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the producer is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, Markit's main economist.
Germany’s largest EU trading partner, Russia’s manufacturing PMI, fell to a minimum of 11 months of 51.4.
In the second largest economy zone, France, SMEs fell to 46.9.
Concern over France prevails, Italy has again moved from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared are also not too soothing," Dobson said.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to bring oil into the fire of analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where SMEs grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the production overview of the buyer managers for the syrup is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
Addendum: The eurozone producers currently have a very difficult life because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the ever-increasing conditions in many countries.
This growing uncertainty of trade has become evident - and this is especially the confidence of consumers, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially those of expense.
He stated that as "even more likely" it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative release, "though we expect it to be limited".
Ten years of hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of the occupied school, children still suffer
Ten years ago, the Czech radicals at Beslan school in southern Russia were held hostage by thousands of people
During the three days of suffering and the shock of the world, more than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the animal school
Just ten years after the terrible siege of the school in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, warned the surviving heroes of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, children and parents were captured and murdered by fanatical terrorists, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy brought the East and the West together, which in this catastrophic accident led to negotiations and the future.
After ten years we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the animal school.
We have found wonderful young people who have suffered misfortunes, even though the memory of the hell caused by terrorists will live on.
What is their greatest desire?
That the war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is over.
A girl trying to get back into a destroyed school gym
She was caught by a former Russian photographer Dimitry Beliakov, only trying to get back into the bombed school gym after the bomb exploded in her underwear.
Mistaken Aida desperately was looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
They were afraid they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"A strange woman told me to run away and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said this time.
I had my feet from the blood.
I got up and came back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After some surgery, she thought she had been completely healed, but yesterday she said: “The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I'll have to do another surgery.
In my knee there's a piece of stripe left.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people just as the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said decisively.
“It just happened to me, and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to our friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future partner in the Jerry Gapoev class were killed there.
When we were kids, we played together and we wondered how we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about the arrest, but her memories are a little pale every year.
I'm glad so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we're very grateful for the help we've received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet, as I walk through the school window, I say that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from repeating itself.
A boy who avoided the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school in seven years) and he survived the school's class hug in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At that time, a seven - year - old said: “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran away and saw the pay-per-view battalion, took the baby by the hand, and ran away with a spray ball.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was able to escape and lay in the hospital with a broken leg, and she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I was crying with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the lost news of the World), where then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The terror is coming back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say the memories are already blank.
I remember throwing all my guns at the game right away.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing in the court and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember traveling to London well, especially how I could choose what I wanted in the toy and how I drove a convertible.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where he's suffering from war just as he and his friends have suffered.
That terror is coming back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am very sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," says Damir, who participated in volunteer activities in the monastery last week.
I want a lot of help.
I want to work with the police once, and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “37 children from our neighborhood have been killed, can you imagine?
I remember the silence immediately after the attack, and there were no children here who would scream and run, and it took a few months for that silence.
He remembers his life on the road with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her money for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir having a taste for a toast, and so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shot them out of the water gun and they ran and played with him.
And it was only a month since that horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think that the world has not changed for the better in those ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it was and will still kill a lot of kids.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people war is just something in reports that they hear when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are living through, what a terrible thing it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed. People still want to kill each other. It's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet boy, he's not at all aggressive or rebellious.
For example, he doesn't complain about revenge, he doesn't care.
I know she doesn't like it, but she's very close to six partners and she goes to the gym every once in a while and they light candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember him lying on a couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying like that for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had his eyes open.
I also remember that he threw all his guns or other weapons at the game. Damir is 17 today, he's taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.
It's hard to believe that I've been certain for several hours that he's dead and that I'll never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boy didn't have this hell chance to survive.
“I remember screaming, ‘Damire, run away!’ but I was convinced that he didn’t hear me.
But he heard it and ran away.
So our life is different from the rest.
Grigorij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of the horror in Beslan
Comfort: Surviving from Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, right Grigorij today
When he ran away from life after the Chechen terrorist shot his associates, his bloody face was filled with fear.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the beast in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school the first day and rushed her older son Vladimir to college.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the court, so my boy stayed there alone for three days," she recalled.
Not all alone because we had relatives there, but everyone died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
The closer the date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
It won't take a day for us to remember the tragedy.
We don't think it's happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, and some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise, no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: The Grigorie photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was practiced as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory being so excited about school that day, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he's alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino there's even the statue of paying Grigory.
Grigory's looking at the picture unsightly, and we've got her hidden in the library at home.
I understand, but I also think that this image of people all over the world knows how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important not to repeat this.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still under investigation, but the truth never comes true.
Now they're investigating the Boeing accident in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what the reason was?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, they don’t want war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
For us to forget a little, it takes ten years.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years ago, I had a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and associates who were killed.
That's why, as of September 1, I'm going to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is a past.
I won't forget it, but I won't.
My life is going on.
This year, I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
At first, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but for the sake of health, I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was held at the feet of a killer terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a killer terrorist during the attack, yet he was able to survive
When he was attacked in full flow, he was arrested in a gym, sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
It's a real miracle that he survived.
"It seems to us like it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injury he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me. It's not something I've been throwing at my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that kids with bad experiences can handle better - I have to say it's not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and was a little better then, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - year after - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go there again, and don't want to come after me, please, so I can show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregorij Farniev today, on the notebook with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
That pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think or talk about it, and they never ask me at school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful of my knees that I've hurt myself, but I'm walking normally.
But even though I couldn't get up and study at the FBS Academy in Petrograd as I wanted.
I sent them my papers, including medical reports, and they told me that it was impossible.
My other concern is animals, so I went to the vet.
I did it the second year.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cow-to-cow."
He said: “I know I will never explain it to my children.
It's not something children should know about and not anything they should ever experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The disease will still be here.
He's inside and he's getting worse with his next birthday.
I'll participate in the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's grown-up today, but the fear goes on.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that's how 50% of the fear has already overcome, but to overcome it completely and it's not worth forgetting.
This terrible experience will be with us all the time.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed and the pain only worsened.
I lost a lot of people I liked and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and it's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me the loss of the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It's hard to assume that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world -- wars in other places.
What are the people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could take all those rebels and throw them away, how far away will it go?
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child that led to the security of the special command
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is carrying on a safe Russian special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all
In 2004, the world was in a state of shock when a small Alyon was handcuffed by a Russian police officer from the Beslan occupation.
The terrorists let her go, but they left her 30-year-old mother, a ten-year-old sister of Kristina and her brother, Makhara, in school.
Makhar, who at the time was three years old, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died at the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and with his new wife, Lighted, they have a girl named Kristina after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, doesn't remember the attack at all, and she's grown up with a bright and happy girl.
A close friend declared that “it is a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants children to keep away from memories that he remembers the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to manage better photos and videos
If you are interested in photos or photos under water, you have a wide selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact like Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera of type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these photos at the family party of a few photographers, all cost less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Although you have a watertight camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Next set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will be editing.
Some cameras and cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes exposure to the dark environment under water.
And before you go into it, find out how deep you can sink with your equipment.
Some cameras are only designed for up to 5 feet, another up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to purchase and evaluate digital cameras in regular and watertight performance.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't come out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you with the composition of photos, but the outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCDs, under the water, it's going to look bad and the composition of the picture is unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode, which makes a series of images with a slightly different lens of exposure, use this.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper porridge, the light is striking.
If possible, stay in the swimming pool, lake or sea close to level.
This will also allow you to capture more light on photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
It's great advice if you take a picture of the drought, but it's even more important under the water because of the denser light.
It is especially important if you are filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of the corner, which means that if you want to fill in the photo box, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality strength was able to change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve the sick from the pain caused by the disease and the treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an officer of MI6, who had to live with the consequences of the torture that had frozen him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, the treated patients in the vast majority are interested in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was the one who started suffering.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He had to deal with flu symptoms and found out that he was impatient and his wife, Juliet, included rashes.
He said, "I want it all to be done sooner than later."
When Juliet went on a service trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
His colleague made him an X-ray chest.
He was skiing in the French Alps for two weeks.
X-ray results came.
He had a mesothelioma, an irreparable tumor that affects the uterus or the lungs.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer smoked.
Mesothelim is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of asbestos exposure - a fibre construction material that was previously called "magic", but today it is known that it is mortally dangerous.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore mesothelimus.
The asbestos, at last, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when it entered into force the ban on the use of asbestos in industry.
Even at the time of the use of asbestos, only certain groups of people came into close contact with him, such as insulators of insulation, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers.
Toxin used in industry in a different era today is difficult to appear as a cause for concern.
Such self-esteem is not in place.
In Britain, it appears, there is a mesothelioma epidemic.
The number of deaths in mesotels is higher than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths per year are twice the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths to mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we feel its effects right now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos have finally been banned in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades to develop.
The mesothelioma is not just about the veterans of the construction industry.
asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in homes where we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in shops where we buy.
Mesothelim, therefore, does not respect social status, wealth, occupation, or age.
The privileged gardens from London business houses after public school do not represent hiding.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are the warehouses of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put in isolation.
He was trying to find out where he could come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basements of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years in practice,” he wrote.
All - students, sisters, doctors and returnees - the halls were used.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question that he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital who then appeared to mesothelius in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17th this year, he was 55.
Surviving this diagnosis is not common for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can just repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are sick with the same disease?"
According to former British expert on Professor Julian Pet's mesotel, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
When looking at the files from the courts archives, which often turn to and require compensation, it shows how much mesotheliomic dust has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that she was not interested in exhibiting asbestos Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she watched in two stores in the clothing section - one of the places was a flagship company, Oxford Street store.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
She has two kids today who's over 20.
“Before this happened,” he says, “I’ve never heard of mesothelioma before, I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
I've never even thought about myself in my sleep.
There's not a lot of people who know about asbestos.
Actually, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
He was named because of his fibrosis structure that gives him strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
The most common is found in buildings today, usually known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boilers and even brake linings.
He is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, but he is considered by the EU and WHO to be "a major health risk" that can lead to death.
It is more dangerous, but it is flammable asbestos and blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of molten asbestos, and experts claim that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of unusually high presence of mesothelimus [in the United Kingdom].”
Employee Marsk & Spencer was offered asbestos at the Oxford Street Flag Shop in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peta's work indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient study states that “a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by the "normal use and expansion" of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government don't have to think they might be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that said that the service lifts and pipes behind the parliamentary committee's rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be damaged by something as harmless as "strong air flow".
Ministers are often accused of taking care only of their own interests, in this case but may be true.
Although Parliament's Services Directorate has insisted that the Westminster Palace receive a "good medical certificate", it now counts that it will take one million pounds and several years of work to be carefully inspected, modernised and removed asbestos, and that after the 2015 elections, MEPs will sit more than on green farms in Westminster in the areas of Queen II's Conference Centre.
Goddard's report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations."
You can't tell if this mess is gonna cost you your life.
Everyone can only wait now.
One person who has never been able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspected that asbestos was exposed to work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven," she says, "but in my case I cannot prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked, and when he worked there.
But of course he remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was hit by something like a cold.
He was 45, he was evening, and he was just in the middle of the operation.
Suddenly, I broke up.
It came back.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wasn't going home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from a deer, a pulverizer around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe that it was mesothelis.
Finally spent the month at home.
The confused doctors made him an X-ray of his chest and put in his chest catheter to remove the fluid that was sent out of his lungs to discuss.
Still, they didn't make a diagnosis.
His condition gradually improved and he went back to work.
From time to time, though, his symptoms returned, often after he practiced and took his breath.
In 2011, one of the Abbott patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelius.
Even then Abbott didn't have anything to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and got into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he had a probe equipped with a camera between the chest and the lung.
I'm an optimist.
I tend to take nothing too seriously," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry too much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesothelis."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started meeting with the sisters of the charity Macmillan and one advised him to contact the lawyer.
At that point, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It has turned out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the tube," he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now becoming ill.
Mesothelimus, therefore, is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have a risk profession.
The most dangerous tubes that were heat-insulated with asbestos were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be in danger.
However, staff who walked underground between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (such as Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it turns out, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could be saved, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who had treated them.
The asbestos is being removed today.
The Bunsen's disciples built their kahan on asbestos floors
And it's not just about the hospital.
asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and councillors because of its excellent insulation and non-inflammatory properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people were already exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless hours chemistry students built Bunsen's kahan on the asbestos floor.
Websites dealing with the question of asbestos in schools have emerged.
Undamaged items such as floor tiles or roof coverings on tools in our homes usually contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison built into a large amount of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could recall in the 70 ’ s when she was fighting the garden home.
So be careful how you fight the garden home.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the effect of diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while for you," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found out I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I was gonna have to go and deal with myself.
Well, I don't like the next Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As a countless number of patients before him, he also remembers how he felt confused with the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard for everyone to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have left?"
I was told 12 months ago.
I remember saying, “Well, I don’t have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelim is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos exposure.
The asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks and the fibers breathe, they can sit in the mine, the lungs.
The asbestos fibers of the fertilized glands can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is that the inspired asbestos fibers are needle-shaped," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who entered Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is a paradoxical center for mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson knew and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos likely during practice in the hospital.
The eel of asbestos comes into the fabric of the lungs, says Treasure, and “self - breathing is a push to the edge where the exhibitor is located.
His character is invasive from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options used in other types of cancer are not taken into account on mesothelias.
Fire is discussed, for example, about the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, she'd be worth a try.
Treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the mine," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer "does not respond to chemotherapy", which is "has any effect", but does not cure.
"At the moment there will be someone who survives lung cancer," said Treasure.
But in the end, everyone will die.
Fortunately, some patients live longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After finding mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counsel for the same disabled.
When they called, he was glad to say, “Good afternoon, you have reached the center of cancer.”
"It was very positive," said Abbott.
His disease was diagnosed four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and would probably prolong his life only for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give it up.
Lawson, however, "has been able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the department of breast surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait until I was sent to him, but I just called and they saw me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application and they'd have to approve the compensation.
For patients with mesothelioma, the key issue is money.
But when different treatments fail inevitably, many patients face other financial concerns - about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan with Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960 ’ s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And this is where we're meeting a non-compulsory company.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but Morgan said it wasn't a "valuable settlement", because Lawson couldn't definitely prove that the mesothelimus was the result of an asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
However, after the case was investigated, the spokesman Guy's Hospital confirmed that "absoluteness in an incriminate underground part was removed in the 1990s."
It was for Andrew Lawson too late.
How to remove asbestos
The exposure of fatal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after this happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of old jobs have changed owners or broken down.
The insurance evidence's lost.
And those who are now accused of defending themselves have time on their side, which certainly is not their prosecutors.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation was adopted this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to claim compensation, even if it is not possible to monitor their former employer.
The law created a 350 million financial reserve, which is built by insurance companies and is designed by people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but do not have anyone to complain about.
In such a case, they will receive 80 % of the amount that the court would normally assign to them as compensation - approximately 120,000 pounds.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks 350 million pounds is "good work".
"It is an agreement written down by insurance companies," he says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what the insurance companies would have to pay if they did not waste their time and people with mesothelioma would be able to care for ex-employers and would normally complain about them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps".
But Penning and Morgan admit that with seven deaths each year, fast negotiations were needed.
"People suffer too much and need help immediately," Penning said last December during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in charge of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, he recommended Lang-Lazdunski's operation, which, unlike Tom Treasure, thought it had a positive effect.
After the surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were followed - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a 5 year survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott's got a backup.
"This is not of course the most important thing," said Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott joined the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last six cycles of chemotherapy.
Control visits showed no signs of disease.
I went for further control in March [2014].
In my chest, I had a few scattered scars.
My 50s were just getting closer.
It's not life-threatening.
Take it.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no signs of a tumor in his body.
But it's a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show the woman how the boiler wakes up.
If you get bad news, you're starting to get negative.
You need to look ahead.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it is not always easy.
"For parents it's hard," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends and all of a sudden we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more protracted.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients must face such interviews.
In patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not delayed hope or merely a sign of chance for survival.
The disease brings with it (and finally brings Stephen Jay Gould) unhappiness.
As Andrew Morgan says, "life is not a threat to mesothelis."

Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
The Board of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for damage to health resulting from the exposure of asbestos in Britain.
World production of asbestos increases to more than 4 213,000 tonnes annually.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos shall be prohibited in Britain by law.
The use of all types of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesothelioma Act shall enter into force in the United Kingdom.
A 350 million compensation programme has been launched.
asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world white asbestos is still used as cheap building material.
World production is kept at two million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
The Chinese Parliament, in spite of the numerous discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will trigger long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's trading district, as activists began to organize and plan only a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress basically allows Communist leaders to remove any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it upset us," said lawyer Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it is clear that we have something to do with the authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997 when Britain returned to Hong Kong, Beijing has promised that as of 2017, the people will be able to choose an executive power.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders hold firmly to the appointment process of the committee, which is closely controlled by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be eligible.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded one of the biggest and most recent protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are driven by the occupation of the Central with love and peace, which the organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them general voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the movement of the occupation in the rain gathered in front of the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organizers announced that their movement was entering the new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks the wave of protests began.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Centre only as a last step in the event that all possibilities for dialogue were exhausted and no other choice would be made.
We need to announce with due respect that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the presence of the Centre is inevitable.
The Hong Kong authorities prepared for Beijing's announcement all day and strengthened the protection of the government's seats and deployed police and barricades on Sunday.
According to many Hong Kong residents, the feeling is that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The arrival of solid people increases competition in the field of products and services.
They are also concerned that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being distorted by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the movement of the Occupy of the Central and say their demonstrations threaten the trade - the rescue ship of Hong Kong.
"The protest he is talking about could cause much greater economic damage according to how many people participate and for how long," says political Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We don't want Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
The Chinese state media has also come up with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong describe as undercover Western-led agents.
In the summer, activists organised an informal referendum on voting rights with 780,000 participants - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
A pre-election agit?
The League in Jihlava bears a name according to political movement
A small mine is played in the local town of Vysočina by about 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is now called the League of Jihlava.
The name was given according to one movement that goes into October municipal elections.
A decade on his candidate is also the boss of a small mine in Jihlava, Jan Mráka.
"There was a great crowd where there was no problem with that," said the Dark One.
The situation around the first league of small miners has already been handled by lawmakers in Jilava and recommended changing the system of distribution of grants.
The little miner got about a million crowns from the city web site last year.
And this year, it's about hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not a small mined procedure contrary to the law or to the directives of the magistrate.
The situation, however, is an incentive for the Authority to adjust the rules for granting grants and grants," said Professor Radek Tulis.
Drawing a grant from the city and at the same time expressing support as a small mine in the elections of one political party will probably not go away.
At the high school "big" football, a similar demand from politicians has not yet come.
That the ČSSD would produce a regional override, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for you.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from a number of companies to contact us," said the president of the Regional Football Association Miroslav Vrzáček.
The head of the small football team on the other side and the movement into the league's name won't let go
According to the players, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, tents and social facilities.
"For example, the playground on the stairs is not ours, we're renting there," said Ondrej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava Club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mill.
But there will, for example, be built, in my opinion, a pointless area for skaters, which is about fifty in Jihlava," the Dark One warned.
The lover of Jihlava Jaroslav Vyroszal (ODS) responded that a small mine uses a field with artificial grass in the streets of Rosičí and Na Stepupás, which are in the city's property.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We are going to modernise or build sports facilities at schools that will be available in the afternoon.
I think he's made tremendous progress in recent years for a small mine," added the Uzzal.
The other political parties in the name of the League will not appear according to Jan Dark.
We have limitations.
If someone from one department enters the partnership with us, we don't give the other one any more," he explained.
"Political movement in the name of the League, I consider this to be at least an unfortunate step," said a member of the Advisory Committee on Sport Karel Voldán.
"But let the voters decide whether Mr. Mráka is using Little Dignitary Jihlava and the grant of the city for political purposes, or not," he added.
American tradition enters university life - the first can fly by airplane
We are pleased that we can answer the question by launching the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression when entering the university, the company also offers transport options including a private pusher or a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service has its own security page.
Service is the ideal option for students who otherwise have to drag their things across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are happy that with our VIF (very important hairher - very important element) variants this year, we will ensure students that they arrive at the university with minimum nervousness and maximum luxury.
The spokesperson said that, given that the services had just dropped, they had no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations over the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students pay annual school fees of 9,000 pounds, it expects the service to take its place on the market.
Compared to ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are other students with regard to expectations and desires - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The national student union, however, criticised the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students entering the university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before they release thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving on track, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists face racism and police behaviour after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson killed an unarmed young man in Missouri.
And those who are present at the funeral, with their hands, scantly, “Do not shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri about the shooting of the unarmed young man Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz recorded a movement in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex before sex.
With increasing tensions in the Middle West, which attracted the attention of the national press, Peréz observed that protein reaction is concentrated in 100 % on race.
Compared to the reactions of black people soon after the shooting on 9 August, personal articles with titles such as “thinking of white over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not just about suppressing women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminist movement who would talk about race and lesson at such a level," she said.
People felt that what happened had to be expressed.
For the crisis we are facing, it is characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially winning that they have to warn.
According to the English professor at the State University of Ohio, Coritha Mitchell, Ferguson highlighted the problems that African Americans have to face every day and that in the cultural sphere are not regarded as "women's issues".
"I can publish funny stories on Facebook from my partner's life and get 150 people from people all over the world," Mitchell said.
If I write something about coloring in my own country in traps, it's quiet deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relations, but not about safety in public space?" she asked.
For black people like Mitchell, who were concerned with race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no difference between race and sex dichotomy.
According to her, blacks couldn't wish for luxury through these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although the whites today have a question of race and sex in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's questions and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the same.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black people were lynched and almost all cases of white blood cell rape," Hattery said.
For the purpose of lynching, you needed the cooperation of whites.
According to Hattery, the divide between whites and blacks came when voters for election rights such as Susan B. Anthony investigated in the late 19th century fields and realized that election rights can only have one group of people - women or blacks.
"Decisions to put cards on the voting rights for women and the right for black people to focus later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important preview of why colored women don't believe in whites.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people to protect their husbands and children.
Even after women had obtained election rights in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Women to prevent lynching.
The group was born 40 years after the black people first said they wanted help.
According to Mitchell, the response of white feminists to the questions that occurred in Ferguson - the issue of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "choose" the questions that blacks faced generations.
“ Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these places [traditional feminism] had the right to raise a child as seriously as they had the right to contraception?” Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists who have made career struggles for reproductive rights and access to contraception now find out what that means.
Major feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown's attack on Facebook, where they published Rebecca Carroll's column from the Guardian, which demanded that the white Americans protest more strongly against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding danger in society - and opinions on race that differ significantly in public opinion polls - will try to change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem remains intersectional feminism, which includes questions of race and sex, her comments on the question of race in America are some people matatu.
Experts from the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book "Who stole feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colouring men, are "a lot more vulnerable than their sisters", but the Steinem Party of Ferguson's comments face criticisms that she has already caused.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost no boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program that had help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The police's relationship with the Montenegrin community is not the only problem that comes before the interest of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police had detained nearly 63,000 young people without escort this year in the southwest of the country, the issue of immigration law reform again arose - this time as a female issue.
Andrea Marketa, co-chairman We Belong Together, a women-mobilising organisation for the reform of immigration laws, said that to be able to raise the issue as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Market.
Because most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them feel vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have ads in women's organisations," she said.
Pork residence in Ipswichi for sale
The real office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it was resting on it in a pighouse.
A single-room house, which is for sale for 120,000 pounds, is on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig’s couch.
The real office of Connells stated that the pig on the photograph is a pet of the owners.
"The photo was wrong there, and that's why it's already been removed," said the speaker's office.
In the real estate information, the real office of Connells described the former prayer as "a single single single single room house."
Although the photo office has already removed from its website, promotional materials still appear.
The sale of the house sparked interest in social networks where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has a fresh millionaire southwest city
The Harvey lottery player gets a million.
Looking for a new millionaire in the South East of Perth, one lucky man will take $1.1 million from the Saturday lottery.
Traffic in Harvey had already been lucky for the second time for five years, and the last was in November 2009 to win a million dollars.
But the lucky winner has to log in first.
The store owner Steve Forward said he was talking about winning the whole city in southwest Perth.
It's the main theme, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was for touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia split one win last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and only a few weeks earlier in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning twins have spent 20 years and said that winning will enable them to process the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
In the press release, the GDL protested for a warning post for which it had approved the time off the transport point.
At the chosen time, GDL takes a look at many people who return from the weekend by rail until the first working day.
At the same time, we are thinking of people coming for work during the day," the board said on Monday morning in a press release to declare their position.
"Our first stop should mainly affect freight transport, less passengers," GDL added.
DB has not yet published an official response to the statement of position.
It is not even clear how the protests will affect international railways, including the Czech Republic.
The Boards require an increase in the wages of drivers by 5 per cent and a reduction in the working hours by two hours per week.
Currently, the average wage of drivers is between EUR 36,000 and EUR 46,000 (998 thousand and SEK 1.27 million) annually, depending on processed years.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to join the increase in wages when the working time is reduced.
They stress, however, that the wage assessment of drivers must develop as well as for the other railway staff with whom DBs do not count on the reduction of the working week.
It was a threat that Christ's car would start to burn.
That's why the Barum rally is over.
What exactly happened?
It was a bad material.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like that could happen.
Could the leak be temporarily fixed and continued at a slower pace to the service where the mechanics would replace it?
If we were going straight there, yeah.
But there were still two other erections waiting for us, and it didn't work.
There's a high temperature in it and the risk that the car would start to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You've had five speed tests at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like a mess.
We were fast, but I didn't go through the window.
Everything was caused by the car that we've had more than half a year to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You divorced him so you could really think of winning.
I made myself and my car so we really had a win.
Work didn't come in.
On the other hand, the result that we could think of didn't come up with.
But this is Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the spikes that got out of the first fight.
They also got out of him foreign favorites of Breen, Abring or Lappi.
Were you surprised that so many favorites have gone away?
Yes.
Especially for the spectators, it was a pity, because the race ended early.
Jaromír Tarabus, which you're going to drive, has been moving for a long time at the top.
He only paid for getting out of the track and took almost two minutes off the track.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's too bad because he could repeat the rank of the winners.
He's been driving for the first time.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was good.
He's going very fast.
Just a year ago you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of driving again make you a regular participant in the rally races?
I'm sure not right now.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race, and I didn't respect it anyway.
I decided I'd take her back.
It was my present nineteenth start, and if there's a chance in a year, I'll probably go to it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people have come to the road just because of you.
Did it please you?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's going on with Barumce?
The team continues.
Next week we'll go to Wyskov, where Robert Adolf will run.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
Besides, this race from us wants to borrow the fabia of Honz Sýkora.
Mira and I have a European twinning in Switzerland and Corsica.
That's what we're gonna have to do next year.
Can you point out something?
No, nothing's decided.
When Corsican rally was part of the world's championship, the fifth place you reached your peak in the series.
Isn't it easy for you to try that track again?
He's not.
An oral agreement with an employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not allow your doctor to give you confirmation of your disability, which serves as proof to the organization that you cannot perform your duties for health reasons.
Besides, you didn't immediately notify the employer.
As a result, it was agreed that these days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement only took place orally.
Although the labour law does not reserve the obligation to allow the employer’s consent to the withdrawal of the leave to be confirmed in writing, in practice this procedure has been proven.
If there's only an oral agreement, you don't have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the withdrawal may be granted, as in your case, and the absence at work may be considered as a long-term unexplained absence, thus the reason for the immediate termination of the working relationship under § 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a court dispute on an agreement with the employer, you thus lack proof.
The working relationship with you has not been cancelled under § 53, you only have the days specified in the statement as an unexplained absence.
Unexplained absence in the budget sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to collect substantial unemployment insurance), however, it is difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit your doctor again and let you confirm in writing that there has really been a damage, as a result of which you have been unable to work (the so-called "incompetence" is just a doctor's document).
When you are looking for a new job, you can present the above document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the presentation of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, the prompt notification of the employer or the request for written consent with the withdrawal of the permit.
You avoid any complications like this.
Tony Stewart's accident on the way back
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a bit behind the half-way of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stewart came to play the second time after his right front tire broke in 172. And the race ended for him.
Stewart took the wrecked car to the garage, didn't express himself to the reporters and left.
Chief Chad Johnston told his team that car number 14 was disappointed, but he will now focus on a race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping that we'll do more.
Stewart came to play for the first time in a Sunday evening competition after a train with Kyle Bush, which required repairing his car's right side.
"We put our hopes for a good ending to today's race," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at the New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get a place in the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of a tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who led Stewart to the race.
The authorities said the investigation of the cause of the accident would last at least two weeks.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
A three-way champion was waiting for a hot boost before the race.
Stewart started at 12th place, started the race at 10th place, and then even 4th place.
Then, at the beginning of 122nd wheel, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, got out of the other corner and hit Stewart, and sent both cars to play.
Stewart's continued, but he's down to 21.
Prague has chosen a new taxi manager, earning 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new manager of the taxi service.
For 103 parking lots, it's worth about 12.3 million crowns a year.
Recently, in the same places as drivers of taxis, she selected 150 thousand kroner each year.
He informed the councillor Lukáš Mannhart (TOP 09).
The city used to be used for the selection of managers.
The winner then earned a rent for a fee of 1,000 kroner a year.
But the rules have changed.
The tenders are currently being decided.
"The year since the opening of the original leases and the opening of the election proceedings has proved that the new lease system is far more beneficial and more just for Prague," the council said.
The most expensive spot is in Perština
The highest price was offered by the interested parties on the street of Na Perštýna.
He pays 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns have been paid by new administrators for seats in front of the General House or in Václav Square.
The new rules on rentals of taxis services were adopted by the council in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year the original leases were announced.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and the new manager found 29 positions.
We had to clean the cold this second year.
We've always let her go, which is why there's practically a second fisherman around the cottage.
Then we poured Savo in there.
Unbelievable blow!
Our cold in the shop always had enough of the beautiful scented water.
And it wasn't the expert who did it, the grandfather took it out with his own help.
It's been a long time.
She was just on three laps and she was totally sloppy, like everything else on the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this summer.
When we started the season, of course we ran out of water.
When she stood there for a few months, she deserved it.
But even then we thought the water didn't smell.
We were wondering if something was wrong.
In the place where the pump went through, it was possible at a bit of regret, the board didn't quite stay there, so the opening was tight with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise there was nothing to see in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we let her go again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we've improved the improvised tightness around the pump pipe.
We've noticed strange things in the basement.
There was an on-the-earth box with some bones.
At least it looked like it.
And the next piece.
Now it looked like an ostentatious mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where streams, Grandpa's invention, there were fish leftovers!
And it's hard to live!
Our store is also veneered.
Someone would have said that Grandpa had recently buried a cabin.
And it wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and floors are just dusty sand, only the ceiling is subdued.
They're taking ships mostly there.
And the car.
And a bed on the beach.
The door with wide spaces was mostly open as someone walked there in one piece.
At the roof several already mentioned streams.
No network, so they usually fly in there and build a nest on the tracks.
It's unnecessary to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to fight, and that's it.
But now he didn't even help the air.
The whole store ran off.
So we cleaned up the whole store.
Especially was the fish on the tram!
We also threw out things that were around: the beams, the heraclite board, and so on.
Our chat room in the distance was welcomed by the surrounding disinfectant.
We've been thinking about who could get us those disgusting remnants?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in everyone.
It would be hard for us to celebrate.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who's not all right.
Isn't he the Frant we're in?
It's almost all year round, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to keep a safe and regularly checked.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only on washing and washing before the tests were finished, but it was good.
Pulling water out of the forest barn is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
One day we heard the terrible ghastly shudder of our pheasant.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw in the grass next to the veranda a long, strong black hat.
The knife jumped over her and shot her like a fool.
Her mom hoped because she thought that Réza had dug a garbage dump out of the washroom.
All of a sudden, the snakes went into the club and got a little straight.
There's been a meeting on the balcony.
The cut got hysterical arrest.
We ran down.
The goose, long over a meter and thick as a bull, was going to grab a huge rag, and Réza was defending it.
It wasn't clear whether she wanted to save her ass or if she wanted to eat it herself, but it was not enough.
When the wolf saw the power in the shape of our entire family, she probably said that we should eat it when we were so hungry, and then she elegantly dragged herself into the store.
We were flying for her.
It was a very bright jump for the cold.
By the way, we've noticed another smelling package on her desk.
According to the smell of fish.
She wasn't there last night!
Our new security around the pump was a little rusty.
And we've closed the store over the day.
That he would...
We went out, and we're all stuck in one stream.
We haven't waited long.
It's embarrassing for the cold.
First, a flat head with yellow moons on its neck appeared.
Then the whole rope went out into the cold.
She swam around the pump and started getting in.
The fired employee made up his mind, bought a notebook and sold it to the company.
A mature employee bought it on the computer and then sold it.
The money he got came to waste before the police were arrested.
In a short time, a man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After taking the notebooks he drove to Olomouce, where he sold them after the bazaars," said top commissioner of the Smurf Police Rostislav Brügner.
The reason for the frauds was the revenge of the employer for the release and also the gain of money.
"In the hearing he claimed that he used the money to pay for the loans," said Brügner.
The police also found that the cheater is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated for psychiatric purposes.
Money could thus also end in winning devices or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is we haven't found any money with him," said the Commissioner.
A cheater who has been convicted of theft for one year or five years is now in danger of being imprisoned.
Politicians have not yet ruled out whether the punishment is also threatening the barbers who bought and sold the notebooks at a price.
"It is true that they have taken over completely new goods, which is minimally suspicious," the Commissioner noted.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar were charged so far.
Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it, or how I enjoyed We Run Prague.
This year, the editors have made several changes.
The biggest change was the route that led to the flood, instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of Rungo.cz team, but I was going to spend it a little bit on the other side.
With the entire team, we decided to personally heal our readers at a stand where we took pictures and videos together.
In order to reach perfection, I took the role of personal guide.
Together with a friend of Katāu, we made an order at the end of the corridor between 60 and 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted friends who were passing us to the faster-run sector.
There wasn't much time left.
A few hot jumps, turn on sports tests, countdown and start!
Crying out loud, but instead of a quick start, there was a boiling to the start line.
After five minutes, we go to the gate, switch on the measurement, and we run at ten o'clock.
We're messing with a yellow hare of runners who run their first race like Katya.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly setting the sun on the sky provides a view of the Vishehrad almost to the hummingbird.
Pulsating meat pulling along the coast seems to be running all over Prague.
On the coast between the Visehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has the strength.
A light hill in the Palaque Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before going to the Theatre, I see a police escort, and immediately behind him is Vitek Pavlišta with an incredible pace to the goal.
I hear the strange inhaled breath of the other runners.
I'm moving to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to cry with me, but right before that, my legs will fall and our hands will fall apart.
Running the Theatre Street gives you a chance for a short rest and relaxation.
There's a need for places in front of us where my views will breathe.
The island on the bridge of Manes shows Prague in the beauty of the sunset.
I don't breathe and my legs almost carry me alone.
For the first nurse, there's a moment of truth.
At the crossing of the road, Katá is stomping about the turning point and leading the jump of the boat.
I see if she doesn't need help, and I'm running a series of words that encourage her not to have time to think about pain.
He's getting up and we're going to go on with Kozi Street, it's one of the hottest places in the race, but there's no such thing as an attack, but there's a need to keep an eye on the environment.
I still don't know that the concept of the closest place will get its true meaning later.
At the Prague gate, we are encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to fuck with anyone who offers a hand, and I'm recommending it to Kate, because ten bangs with fans are like half an energy ratio.
It's actually working, and we're speeding up again, and even though we've fallen off a lot, now we're starting to get on our way.
We run over dozens of runners when I have someone who is particularly tired, I try to encourage him with a few words, "Come on, you can do it."
No one's ahead of us anymore for the last nurse, we're speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the target will hurt, but it really needs to be removed.
The sun has fallen slowly and the end of the day is symbolically slow to finish the race.
The last exit to the bridge, the turn and now just the plane to the target.
The pace we're running is amaze me where that girl is?
"Come on, let's go under 13 o'clock, let's go!" I'm calling.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target.
An hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what to do.
Coach set a limit of twenty hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Close to Kata's goal is to break her legs, I'm helping her to get back to where she's resting for a while.
There is exhaustion on her, but also happiness from well-educated performance.
After a while, I'll take her out of the target room.
Euphoria doesn't make us think of a pushover in the passageway to the dress.
Here it is to see that Kozi Street wasn't the southernmost place.
That's why it's here for a flood that's under the pressure of nearly ten thousand runners to break.
If someone doesn't like the doughnut, it's not the place for him.
I'm losing my mind after a while, and I'm thinking, if those beautiful views and, contrary to the past years, the most interesting route was what's going on in the target.
I know from my own experience that running a race is no fun.
If 10,000 people are added to this, the rich accompanying programme and the closure of the whole Prague transport centre is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed the runners many interesting places, which also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere released in the Yellow Spas moved between the race and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random spectators walked it every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, during the course of the city's historic centre, it has to be counted with obstacles that cannot be removed, but I do not consider the goal of mass race in a place that is restricted on one side of the wall and on the other side of the river to be the best solution.
If I say the race's over, I'll take it as a very good lead.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but it finally worked.
Write to us in the discussion if you like the route and what you say about the situation in the target.
Prisoners in Bulgaria hold protests
Hundreds of prison officials throughout Bulgaria participated in a nationwide protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
At the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the renewal of the original working conditions that had recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the temporary Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
The month’s overseers symbolically protested against the new working time and demanded a return to the original twenty - four - hour shifts.
Although the Prison Supervisory Boards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, informed the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The negotiations are still ongoing," said BNR, Director General of Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
Members of the Federation of Professional Organisations of Employees are also expected to join the protests of prison officials.
Why could the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them?
Physically bestsellers usually don't write, but Brian Green from the University of Colombia managed to hit black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for times to get through to a bunch of problems that a number of theoretical physicists deal with today - trying to combine two perfectly functional but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant universe is that in the search for a united physical theory, there is no doubt about a boring story.
The physical fundamental problem between two key theories (although at this point our universe is de facto divided into two different worlds with different laws) has been solved and solved with such an idea that it is worth retelling and time.
Greene also gave so much fresh advice and encouragement that he could not count how much he didn't include in his book.
In addition, he made his "error" from most of the other two books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Obviously, the author would not object to anything if his book were to be closed more quickly, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant universe still provides almost everything that an informed time with an ambitious understanding of the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the next few years there will be something more alive in this area (it is necessary that the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), so it is good to enter Green's non-violent doors of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound funny, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Yet it's concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand it, let's turn our vision from space to space as a whole to something more underground, specifically to a long and thin garden pond.
Imagine that you are pulling a centimeter garden hat on one side of the canyon on the other and you are tracking the whole scenario from half a mile away (as on the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance you can easily notice a long horizontally stretched snake, but if you just don’t have the bistro-sight, you’ll find the thickness of the snake difficult.
Given your great distance from the snake, you would think that the ant being forced to live on the snake has only one dimension in which it can pass: the left-right dimension along the snake.
If someone asks you where the ant was at the given moment, you will answer only one thing: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hat.
All we want to say is that from a half a mile away, it looks like a long piece of hadice as a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, he's got a thick hat.
If we increase everything, we'll suddenly see a second dimension -- in the shape of a circle that's rounding the snake.
In this enlarged view, it is obvious that an ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right dimension after the length of the snake, but also in "the dimension in/in the direction of the movement of the watch gloves", that is, around the circular section of the snake.
You start to understand that in order to determine the position of the little ant, you have to enter two numbers: how far is it from the end of the snake and where is the surrounding snake?
This reflects the fact that the surface of the snake is two-dimensional (see experts will see that this chapter focuses purely on the disorder theory of strings.
Chapters 12 and 13 shall be discussed in the field of non-compliance.).
The surface of the hadice is two dimensions: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a direct arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circle, marked by a circle arrow, is short and porous.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the hedge is long and easily visible.
The size of the surrounding area of the hedge is short, "swift" and worse noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hadks with a much better resolution.
The above example illustrates the important feature of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they're divided into two groups.
They can be large, wide, and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary small, porous and much worse observable.
Of course, in that case, we did not hesitate to reveal the "sweet" dimension of the thickening of the snake.
It's enough to take a long look.
But if the snakes were thinner - like the hair or the capillary - we would only discover the porous dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein his article, in which he presented with an amazing idea that space geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
Kaluza’s radical claim was based on the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be wetted into a single, unified concept structure.
Immediately, the question arises as to how this Kaluz look together with the obvious fact that we are seeing just three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly predicted between the lines and which he clearly expressed and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oscar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that space geometry of our universe can have both large and porous dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the direction of the length of the snake, our universe also has a large, wide and easily visible three dimensions, whose existence we realize at every moment.
But analogous to the circular area of the garden has an additional dimension, solidly wrapped into a space so immeasurable that so far there have remained hidden even in front of our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer view of the essence of Kaluza's remarkable proposal, let's stay at the harbor for a while.
Imagine that we draw a black and relatively dense series of circles around the hedge.
The distance seems still like a thin single-dimensional line.
With a long view now, thanks to the drawing, we will discover the porous dimension of the snake, and we will see the motive in image 2.
We see clearly that the surface of the snake is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with a second short and circle.
Kaluza and Klein have come up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, a total of four spatial dimensions.
It's hard to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations a little, notice the illustration on Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
The image increases the view of the geometry of the space just as we have enlarged the surface of the snake.
Each next level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have an additional dimension (we see them on the fourth level of magnification), if they are swung into enough small space; thus we explain that we have not seen them directly.
The square grid represents commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circle is new, small and porous dimensions.
Just like smears in a densely covered blanket, even these circles exist in every place of normal dimensions - we just drew them into the averages in the square network because of their perception.
The background of image 4 represents the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common dimensions as meters, represented by a small square side in the square network.
On each of the following images, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will increase it so that it becomes visible.
At first, there's nothing special about it, as we see on a few first level increases.
However, if we go on our way to the microscopic properties of space geometry further - on the fourth level of magnification in image 3 - we will suddenly see a new, shaped circle of porous dimension, similar to sneezing or in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circle dimension exists in each place in the direction of large dimensions as well as has a radius of circle at each point of its length.
In the interests of clarity, we have drawn the circle size only in some regularly located points.
Image 4 Kaluzov and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry summarizes.
The similarity with the hats is obvious, even though we also notice important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we drew only two) where the snake has only one large size.
The even more important difference is that we are now talking about space geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, perhaps our snake.
The basic idea is the same.
If an additional circle of porous dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as is the round circle of the hadice - much more difficult than observing the apparent, large and wide dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed above the strength of our most modern tools for enlargement.
Most importantly, the additional dimension is not just a roundback within normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly indicates.
The circle dimension is a new dimension that exists in each point of three common long dimensions.
It is the size of the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions of the top-down, the left-right and the front-back independent (and colma) each other.
A fairly small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, with the exception of three common positions in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case more than we would normally expect.

The e-book price is 149,- Kcz.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that, although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzova and Klein's idea that this does not exclude the existence of additional dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with our eyes alone.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can identify the structures of a billionth of a meter.
We can hardly observe the smaller dimensions of the porous.
In 1926 Klein combined the original idea of Kaluza with several ideas from just the parenting quantum mechanics.
Its calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could have a size of about one Plank length, i.e. the size far away from the distinctive capacity of today's devices.
Since then, physics has called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to practice electric guitar: 5th part
The whole substance "twelve" consists of a twelve-stroke harmonious form, which you can repeat on your own.
Whoever taps into the music theory will find its principle explained here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating a slother and a slother whose facebook profile can be monitored here, he has lived as a graphic artist for 20 years.
He's a guitarist of the Wahnut band, from which unfortunately he can't leave.
The guitarist is after his father, just like Brother Matthew, leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on one strand.
"The rhythmic model is just for you, you can figure anything out, then just apply it to a harmonious model of twelve," Honza says.
If you add another string, you can swap the figure again.
Just listen and follow Honzo, which can be thought of with 12 harmony on two strands, and how well it's starting to sound.
If you collect a third string, you can already pop some songs with the tune.
When you finally add the fourth, watch out for the change of loading, he alerts Honza in the video.
Next, Honza will return to the pentatonice and try to put it together with the twelve.
So practice it honestly.
Best of all, you can read this in your conversation with Jane Homolo at his first class of electric guitar games here.
Another target without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, it's for a castle court.
We take the point and we like him.
For the first time we had more chances, for the second house," said the attacker, who scored from the stake this time.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, were you just accompanied by a giant sandstorm?
Somehow I didn't realize it, even though on the second branch, where the domestic fans are, it'd probably be worse.
You fixed the penalty after half an hour, but you also scored the penalty after four minutes.
What happened?
We slept at the beginning, we were passive, the horn came from it, and then the pendulum came after it.
You got up after her, and the first time you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we've played well after the incarcerated goal.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep pace with it, but we couldn't.
To tell the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's probably also true that the housewives said something about their game, maybe they weren't very pleased with it.
You just scored on the opponent's field for the first time, while you didn't even get a goal at home.
Why is that so different?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, but it matters how we fight it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plzen, it's another category.
Four matches you were waiting for, didn't you worry that it might be the same after the last match?
Not at all, but of course we're glad that we don't have to listen to the goal of the last game.
Now we have added another without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet for the great celebration.
Island - the lava flows from the distance of the crater.
A lion flying on the surface of Holuhraun near the glacier of Vatnajökull, flows by a underground tunnel from the kilometers away from the crater.
It is located below the ice-cream, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This reality now worries scientists the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
From yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flies out of the crack about the same amount of lava.
However, contrary to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
In contrast to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x bigger.
However, scientists are afraid that the lava tunnel could open even in places where it is under ice.
If this were to happen, in addition to the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökulsa River in Fjöllum and on other rivers.
Around the eruption is a feeling of a strong smell of cheese, a cloud of steam and gas descends from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourist movements, as was the case in the case of the eruption at Finmvärdhuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is also a lot more gas," says Vulcanologist Armann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, and in the early hours the weather has been in the area almost windy.
The feet after the sandstorm were washed in the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air operations, the orange (second highest) degree applies to Bardhardbung and the yellow (third) for Askja.
The sky over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She's been through the wings.
A flight day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 was presented by a flying acrobat Peggy Valentin, who came out of the cockpit on the upper wing of a double-pane and also between the wings.
It's only transferred to muscle power.
The summer day in Cheb was already late this year, and the organizers were able to prepare some interesting flight pieces again.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walking on wings" in the German acrobat Peggy Valentin, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft 18th.
He paid attention to himself with his brilliant pull.
Acrobatia called Wingwalking has its origin in the United States.
After World War I, many of the former war pilots were trying to be ambushed.
But because of the large number of fatalities, he was banned.
But today he's slowly back to the flight schedule.
Peggy will come out of the cockpit on the top wing after the start.
There's a variety of exercises.
At the end of the show, it moves into the space between the wings of the aircraft, where its show continues," described Luděk Matějječek from the Chebian Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot of Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband, Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main funnel of the program, then the next performance of Mustang's lodger was the famous bakery at the cake.
The legendary plaintiff leaned with the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in the curtain (so-called numbers).
Such a composition could be seen for the first time by flying fans in the Czech Republic.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then gave everything a breath of taking acrobatics with a plane from 1945.
He was made for war yet, but probably never participated.
He was assigned to military reserves.
Since 1963 he has been active in the civil sphere.
Even like a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport at Munich Hradšt.
In the same place is also another pearl of the Chebian flight day, a two-engine Beechcraft C45H Explorer.
He didn't go to the airport to check on a powerful machine.
His embered aluminium wire beamed into the distance.
He also won the Max Holst MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colors of French flight.
The small aircraft was surprised by the rejected Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation to the flight date from the German Hof.
German neighbors in Cheb performed with reconstructed aircraft like 18T or three-member formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Parental care has replaced Lucie Borhy at least for tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - a blonde moderator obviously doesn't know any of this.
Because modern TV news was good for her, as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months at all!
It's only two weeks after the blondes finished their six weeks of experience with women after birth.
However, Lucie will not be shown regularly in the main news report TV Nova.
Regular return is expected according to information Blesk.cz up to a month.
But only her daughter Linda now needs more than TV shows.
Lucie Borhy's back on the TV screen, and it was a hit-and-run black.
Exhibits for a year in Prague?
Hala would sell herself out, planning a farewell to Jágr
It would be worth it if something like this happened during the world's championship.
But it matters how a bond is made," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Game, in which a fascinating Nagan team once again met.
Even the players who took part in the gold hat.
The players should like it, right?
I'm sure.
It would be briefly good to make a farewell to the golden generation during the championship.
I think it's possible to find one or two days during the tournament when it's completely free and where such a match could be involved.
Let's say it to Gum (Jirim Šlegro) or to Bědj Šerban (author of the Jujlav match) who would take care of it...
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you're playing with New Jersey play-off?
So, if I'm going to fly like this...
You don't want to play in a representation.
Or did the Jijulav meeting somehow change your decision?
Representations and exhibitions are two different things and the performance is decisive.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but the performances are decisive, especially at the world's championship.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed at all.
How did you actually enjoy the Naganian search?
It was just a great meeting with the players.
You know, you've had a lot of stories and you've had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that there's a generation that really stood for it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimir Rožička and Petr Čechmánek on the middle.
You're still getting your first representation game on your own?
You don't forget about things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we were in a threesome.
For all, it was the first representational start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, we wouldn't be able to say that.
For a long time in Jihlava, Dominik Hasek was caught.
What did you say about his performance?
Hasan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with that criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticised Jágra for the reasons why he decided to end up in representation).
He's got a great performance, too.
At the time, he was training with me once in the night, and there was a riot.
And now he's caught famous.
First U.S. and then the Netherlands, footballers begin to qualify
On Monday morning, prominent guests ate at the hotel's NH.
People may have seen Peter Czech from Chelsea, representative coach Paul Vrb...
And there, that black dress, it's Tomáš russian!
The hostage of Arsenal and the captain of the representation arrived at the meeting about half twelve of the last.
We have a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't enjoy it?" he said when he was already in the representative's collection before the press.
Czech representation programme
Monday, 1 September: start of the strike, first training
Tuesday, September 2nd: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Yearly)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of strike
Russians and gangs can support fans before the mid-term battle against the United States (20:15).
The representation for them opened yesterday's training, which starts at 6:30 p.m. on the Summer.
And then there's an autogramiade that neither the Russian nor the Czech will miss.
Otherwise this collision of the national team will be more peaceful.
Which commends coach Vrba, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will devote ourselves to what we want to dedicate ourselves to.
Now we'll focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We'll have time to practice things that haven't been so long before," said Vrba, who has been officially running the national team since January.
The Czech football team will conduct a Musketeer’s image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The representation under Vrbo has three matches behind him, all ready.
With Norway and Finland she resigned 2:2 and with Austria lost 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been significant.
That's all right.
The match with the Netherlands is therefore starting to begin with the qualification for the European Championship 2016 process.
Of course, the Czech team would have been helped if the US General had been able to do it.
The first half was to meet.
Now there are important results.
We need to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player who has a three-and-twentieth appointment with health problems is the attacker David Lafat.
He's got a fever.
If he couldn't make it to the U.S. Central Fight, Coach Vrba would call another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she felt after a bad diagnosis for many years that she was going to die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her life thinking she was only a few years away.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves beyond the brain and the pancreas.
The charity CMT UK stated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because there is only very little known about the disease.
It is estimated that in the United Kingdom, CMT suffers from some 23,000 people, which may show symptoms in the field of motor vehicles such as muscle weakness, inability to walk, and broken toes.
The condition may also be insensitive or painful to the affected, which is treatable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease with a very bad prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be placed on a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same.
I fell down every day and it took me a long time.
I've never been able to ride with other kids on wheelchairs or skateboards, and at school I was shocked by how I walked and ran."
When Rogers was 13 and she was after several operations that were supposed to release Achilles' feet and level her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room and looked into her documentation where she found out she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was skiing, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he says.
When they answered, I was shocked, I panicked.
I thought before I got eighteen, I'd end up on the wagon, and before I got fifty, I'd be dead, and then I'd lose all my skills.
I was completely alone and planned a funeral."
When she was 17 years old, she realized that her walking skills had not deteriorated as much as she expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said: “Sweetheart, I don’t think you have the disease, or else you’d be on your way.
I think it's going to be something much less dangerous in life."
After several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When CMT explained what CMT is, I thought I was lucky," she said.
The charitable organisation CMT UK started a month of information about CMT to alert the disease.
Businesses in the Washington area: taxes are levied on economic turnover
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes as well.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxes on companies in the country with economic recovery rates increased slightly last year and companies in Washington were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia, together for the fiscal year 2013, contributed 27.6 billion dollars to state and local deposits, which is 3.8 % higher than 26.6 billion dollars in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were reduced.
According to the study conducted by the professional company Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster by 4.3% than local revenues by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, is from the life tax and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28 %, represents the relatively minimum tax revenue from the company.
Researchers claim that the majority of income growth is due to an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which has increased by 3,7 % this year's property tax after three consecutive years with growth.
Although most profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to exist in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini paid over ten billion dollars last year on state and local property taxes, which represents an annual growth of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of the real estate is not so much an increase in the state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the real estate tax represents a total of five corporate taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax represents almost half of the state and local tax.
“In Maryland they own a lot of real estate by companies, especially the tax base around D.C., a government or non-profit organization that does not pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, income tax to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed to the healing real estate market alone.
According to the data, the revenue from the company also appears to be increasing.
Companies in this region have published a tax on the income of commercial companies of $2.3 billion, which increased by 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has selected one billion dollars for revenue from businesses, most in the region.
Although they are in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the level of the state-wide average of 4,3 %, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4,9 %.
In Virginia alone, there was an average tax increase of 4.1 %.
Virginia has the lowest turnover tax of 6 % of all three districts (of which all have the same tax).
The rate of taxation of businesses in Maryland is 8,25 %, while the average D.C. remains relatively high, at 9,975 %.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has a lower state and local tax and a generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. studies have not been evaluated.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law that reduces corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and the following year it will be reduced to 5%.
If the revenue targets are to continue to be met in the coming year, the rate of income tax fixed by law in 2017 could be reduced to 3 %.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are better off, and therefore they pay higher government and local taxes.
Life tax levied by small businesses as a tax on personal income - the structure of compensation for cost increases by price increases, according to which most companies - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 % last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and the state-wide increase in living taxes will likely continue next year, overall revenues from sales for public and local governments will increase by 6.2 % over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington may, however, remain behind because the reduction in state spending is picking up its tax on the labour market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novaruska and Lafat's knives
Will a new state arise in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novoruska
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the southeast of Ukraine, where government units have been meeting with the Peruvian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russia sanctions they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is, according to it, against democratic values.
The end of the conflict according to him depends on Kyiv, so he can't say when the Ukrainian crisis ends.
Another sanction for Russia?
The Czech Republic has failed to agree with the part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, will propose another form of anti-Russia sanctions for the week, decided tonight at the EU summit.
Journalists were told that by the Permanent Chairman of the Meeting of the Member States of Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobtka, concrete proposals for the movement of sanctions are to be prepared already on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye replaces in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at the European Union summit to the European Council, the so-called EU President, who holds the summit meetings of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuye will be replaced.
In front of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton is appointed by the Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogheriniová.
Italy, which will thus become the Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
The assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it's not just about her
Helping an incurable and long-term patient with a life-threatening condition?

But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a motor neurologist.
There's a CIA manuscript in it, they needed a war, Huml writes about shooting the MH17 flight.
The messenger for the ČSSD Stanislav Huml is clear in who shot the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is obvious that "the strong sanctions imposed in view of the shooting of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead have intentionally caused the Ukrainian army".
According to the law firm, there's also a CIA manuscript.
Unfulfillable promises.
Elections are approaching and parties are again offering impossible
End of homeless in the streets, parking for every family and chain over Prague.
It is repeated before each election: the parties promise impossible.
Now, too, the upcoming municipal elections in politics are promoting those who prefer them more.
The Lidovky.cz server has chosen unfulfillable promises from the present and the past.

Joan Rivers family: "We hold fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to the New York City hospital, but her daughter said today that she had no hope of healing an eighty-year-old comedian.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her finger.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the rescue service, according to which she came to the heart of the Yorksville Endoscopy in Upper East Side, as the source stated.
Doctors deliberately maintain it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of its status, which remains "significant".
The reactions to themselves didn't have long to wait, and it's including actual online support from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is a wrapped title
That the media are traversing reality with their headlines, there's no news.
I know the headlines "selling" the newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's the fact that I've been suffering a lot lately, the louder the word is the shit.
This is particularly true of the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The title "Israel Attacked on Gaza" is quite common.
You can only read in the text that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the stated excuse.
It will then appear the title "Both sides have violated the propensity."
Does the media community realize that this process is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing across Europe (and not just there)?
It hasn't been 60 years since the end of World War II.
So far, people who have survived Shaw are alive.
When I saw a video from the People's Republic of Germany, where the dav was shouting the "Jewish Pigs" and similar suspicions, I was shocked.
Is this what the world wants to finish what Hitler failed?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews, they were destined to eliminate the Slavic?
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You're often referred to as "the watchdogs of democracy."
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation was to be eliminated and the Czech Republic was to be wiped out of the world's map?
Maybe you should also realize one more fact.
In the territory of the State of Israel, almost 20% of the Arabs live with Israeli citizenship.
And they're good there.
If you ask them why they don't go between them, maybe to Gaza, they'll answer why would they do that?
In Israel they have work, social security and health care (I have seen in my own eyes how to the top private hospital of Hadassa, which is financed from the sponsorship gifts of the Jews from all over the world, usually also Arab and understood there).
Hamas is attacking his Arab brothers with his guns.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus this unrest area, is to rescue Hamas and disarm him.
And not judge Israel, not directly in the headlines.
Please inform Hamas of his practices, of his abuse of humans as human shields.
Please inform Hamas that the aim is to eliminate the state of Israel at any price.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Please inform Hamas that he is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please inform us that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been a source of humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, but for which the gas managers do not pay, they even complain that the supply of electricity is sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could be penetrated by suicide attackers in the territory of Israel, but it would have been much better for his Arab brothers from Gaza to build homes, hospitals and schools.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed the statement Monday morning information: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys for $1.04 billion (US$ 970 million) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement was not surprising because no one would expect someone to buy Twitch, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch Google seemed one billion sure, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, who founded Justin.tv just three years ago, had been caught up in becoming a widely used video streaming service - live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online transfers from the game - the words Business Insider “YouTube for live transmitted games”.
Interface Twitch.
On YouTube are already popular videos "Let's play", a kind where wise people (mostly older) play the mystery science theater processing game.
The fact is that YouTube in the description ofTwitch comes to the breaking point a lot, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch, nobody's excited, was a textbook example of how an established company pays off possible competition.
The secret is why the YouTube agreement didn't come out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the statement by CEO Twitche Emmet Sheara: “We have chosen Amazon because it believes in our society, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us to fulfill it faster.”
Another mystery is -- honestly -- the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who claim that sports are better than watching, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about, games instead of real play just to watch.
One thing is to watch in the morning a friend through his shoulder as Resident Evil plays, and the other thing is to watch someone else get twenty hits in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without you being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for how to arrange komlav.
I admit that games like speed run, in which Rogers Banners our electronic times finish the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone isn't a game master or a humour, his channel on the Twitch would probably not be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth on top of internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon use that?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is involved in the Amazon Instant Video as elegant as it might have been on YouTube.
But Twitch has something she wants to attract every firm: the hordes of young men who the advertisers want.
As Director Twitch Share, Amazon and Twitch said, "believe in the future of the game" and the media don't seem to be happening, not like -- half-breathing -- spectators.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheistic blogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Letters Are God's Word."
The original video is attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of many things that are in conflict with their religion, they often ask us, Who will you believe?
To the supposed word of God, or to the word of man?
It's as if human testing is completely null and void compared to the authority they imagine to have their doctrine.
Only when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about God's written people.
If there is really an intelligent Creator for some purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be him who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be him who added another set of evidence that indicates exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion in the final detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people are going to have to tell stories, falsify.
And it was people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposed sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written people, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictation of angels, but those texts were not written by any other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and no gods at all.
If there really was one real God, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, super-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole cosmos.
If such a creature ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only holy letter.
She would be known anywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels, or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure such a work.
And people wouldn't have to blindly believe it because it would be consistent, subject to credible and true evidence, and it would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human boundaries.
It would continue to inspire every reader into the unity of common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything smaller.
Just what we see instead is exactly the opposite.
Instead of the only religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all of them continue to divide themselves into more and more separate denominations, searching for controversial truth and in any way challenging God’s guidance, regardless of the continuing disunity and division in each direction.
Jewish Torah, Christian Gospel, Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláhiv Kitáb-i-Akdás, Zarathustro's Avesti, Sikh Adi-Granth, Mahabratská Bhagavad-Gita, Book Mormonov, or Urantia book are all considered "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true God" and the respective believers each say that these others are lucky.
The only logical explanation is likely to be to some extent everyone.
None of the abovementioned books has any advantage against the others.
None of them have any evidence and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I do not say that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies (obhajobs), because they contain inequalities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered to be the true ones that have already been overcome.
So it cannot be claimed that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote vile beasts instead of morality, and many of them claim to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - that each may also contain a prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
Early theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands, so they are the subject of interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often bound political motivated authors, which explain many of the contradictions and inequalities in these books, especially those found in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, but a mutual comment.
We must again point out that there are two different authors here whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and he's definitely not telling an obvious witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources for Pentateuch only, that is, five books of the Mosaics, and Moses does not attribute any of them to authority, because he certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several closely related oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents have been re-filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as her fellow believers think.
The scrolls from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their infinite basis of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are much younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed the perceptions and ebionics and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodoxism.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were scattered and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these administrations relates to King Ugarita, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young Moscian religion, the authors of the New Law decided to mock and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord on Mount" turned to Belzebub "Lord of the Lot".
So the Bible was deliberately and deceitfully altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Law was canonized in the fourth century B.C.E. in a series of commission decisions on the screen in Nikaj.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by simple raising of hands, as if the reality of something could be accepted or rejected by the vote.
The manner in which the canon developed depended on what was being read on Sundays in the then Christian centers.
What was read the second week after the Magnificence in Jerusalem’s Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the cannon developed from the narrowness of the original church.
So the council simply accepted as an evangelizium any relevant stories that revolved among uneducated masses at that time.
Even so, more than ten books of the Bible were received, even though they referred to them as approved.
Among the rejected items, we will find records of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human writers.
But how could this be approved if God were the true author of this random mix of poems, similarities, and syllables?
Surely the Bible was written by humans and certainly not by too much enlightenment, rather by itself!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in spells, blood victims, ritual spells, magical objects, fiery spells, astrology, and five souls of magic.
They thought that if they use a magic spell that they're bleeding someone, it'll heal him out of the better.
We're talking about people who thought the rabbits were overcrowded, and the bats are birds and the whales are fish and drink that's the whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cows, they'd give birth to stolen calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible were written in a higher form, it would not contain any mistakes it contains.
If she came from a pen that was really superior to the creature and was conceived as a verbal history, then she would contain nothing of what she contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who overlooked or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence against children, loss, rape, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudices against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God’s will.
However, creationists still ignore all this.
Some of their Web pages admit that if there is any truth in conflict with the Bible, it must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn't have their loving books, they wouldn't have a god.
There's one and the other in their world.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "worshiping creation instead of Creator".
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and the God of God alone, and they even insist that the falsification of their supposedly "holy" books is some kind of falsifying god as such.
Not their version of God but all the version of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and that the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from God.
So it is a form of prayer, where believers worship man - made compilations, as if these books were the very God, because they believe that they are Jehovah’s word.
Only God has never written or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
All that people have approved or rejected in their supposed "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, corrected and often also deliberately changed and transformed by only the missing people.

The attacker at the Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of them died
A man named Czech, according to the agency Nova China, entered the primary school building in the morning and attacked around 11 local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed died in the hospital later.
The Czech Republic later killed itself with a high jump, New China, with a link to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.

"This year I want to connect more Czech education with Czech sport," one of the reasons why the first day of school went to the north of Czech.
The school's management recently addressed him to a hockey match in Lithuania.
"They were the first, so I accepted an invitation to participate in the start of the school year," the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started his school year at a private sports school in Lithuania.
In the first grade this year, there were 115 thousand primers.
The primary school will be attended by a total of over 850 thousand children, and the secondary school will be attended by more than 405,000 students, estimated by the Ministry of Education.
The new art director of News News is David Fiala
The new art director of news and advertising television Nova became David Fiala since 1 September.
Alan Zarubu, who has led the creative division of the entire Nova group since 1 June.
David Fiala had previously acted in the graphic department of the Z1 news station.
For the last two years, Alan Zaruby has been involved in the implementation of a complete visual change in news reports Newspapers, Strepines, Prague! and other TV shows Nova.
David Fiala controls very well the synergy of communication between editorial, study management and the graphic department, which is the essence of the art of the news director.
It has a feeling for typography and a pure elegant design, which is the way we want to go in the news screen of Nova next," says the creative director of Nova Alan Zaruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly subjected to hackers, to the public got our photos celebrated
Screenshot of a screen containing unique files
So far, the anonymous user on server 4chan publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, warned of this American server Mashable.com.
He reportedly obtained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where users recorded their injuries by auto-supplying images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't said anything about the problem yet.
The part of the celebrity rejects the images as false, but has already acknowledged the truth of the images concerned.
Among them is the actress Jennifer Lawrence famous for Katniss' title role in the Hunger Games series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Death trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
The photos reportedly showed interest in American magazines, according to reports on server 4chan but wants hacker money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it is very likely that there is a weakness in iCloud's security.
On the GitHub server, however, a tool appeared two days ago, which enabled you to get passwords to your user accounts through hard force, i.e. by automatically repeating your password login attempts.
This tool worked demonstrably, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is true that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before the publication of this instrument.
iCloud users should therefore, for preventive reasons, change their password associated with Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length is at least 12 characters.
Avoid naked images celebrity to consider safe use of online services.
Although companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are more secure than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to store on-line explicit photos or any other sensitive content, encrypt files before uploading first.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic backup of photos from the phone to run only on Wi-Fi and after connection to the charger.
Then you will have the opportunity to move sensitive images "to safety", and mainly you will have space to delete unaided images, so they won't necessarily take space in the online store.
We provide the HN and IHNED.cz readers with instructions on how to encrypt files and communications online in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altaira Valáška in PDF format.
A smart way to save for college scripts
Because the price for a high school script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, an emerging second-year student came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of lending books from senior year olds with the offer of a nominal compensation to hold back their sale back.
"The book for calculations, which usually costs $180, I won the semester for ten and chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He lost 120.
According to the university council, an average student for textbooks and grants is lost over $1,200 a year, but students have different options for how to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is Internet shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the semester book and often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc operating more than 250 bookstores in campus areas says the lending of books has doubled since 2011.
Research in the sector shows that around a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the educational texts are purchased by the National Association of University Trades in University Bookstores.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Buying online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but it is possible to purchase a new $239.99 on the Internet at Chegg.com, in a small store specialized in textbooks.
Buy Used
If you do not mind the comments of other people or the needs and destruction, the appropriate educational options are used.
At Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that Amazon.com paid for the print "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" 42 cents.
The new one was sold for $48.
University Teacher Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, proposes that students at their students check that older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes there are no major changes to the work at the seminars.
If so, the older edition may be sold for a fraction of the price of the last version.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, they are also a favorite alternative for buying used books eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loans
It is also worth considering the loaned textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the costs for the new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about $20 for the whole semester.
List the terms and conditions of the transaction in which you borrow the book, including the wording of the notes, highlights or needs and damages.
Remember: If you do not return the book in time, the price of the new book may be higher than the price.
E-mail
Another option is to take the place of a normal e-book.
Sometimes these books are basically lent in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for download for free, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go shopping.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon come to Pepperdine Law School, recommends driving according to the ISBN, because it guarantees that you buy the right book.
Before ordering your book online, make sure it's really a warehouse, Gault advises.
He made sure of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from the university bookstore.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
And then they found guns in the cold torso at the end of the war
That cold is a piece from St. George's church.
We discovered the growth around and began to pull up the flying nose - about one and a half meters and a half mi.
As we got close to the busy day, we hit the head," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it out, and found it was a torso of attackable German rifles used by SS units.
The finding is apparently unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand," Novák added.
All the wooden constructions have been laid out over time, so it's useless.
But her body is preserved - it holds its shape.
How'd it feel in the cold?
There's one explanation.
It may have been thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably out of fear of being removed.
Fascists wouldn't have done it.
They threw guns into the woods," he thinks.
The gun was the only thing the spirits of the Spirit of the Yesenians found in the cold.
"There could also be hand grenades, those that once were around a lot, so we slowed down the mining work, we carefully swallowed the mud, so that there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The find ends up in a museum depositary in a castle in the nearby Slessky Rudoltics.
General of Ukraine: I haven't released the occupied Czech Republic yet
Exclusive interview Aktuálně.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of Peruvian separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they're calling me from Doneck," he apologized eight times in an exclusive conversation with Aktuálná.cz Ukrainian Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the director of the then Centre for the Liberation of War Prisoners.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban on television.
In every such interruption, it was not possible to not hear the names of the people, their numbers or places where they were - or should be - who Ruban was clarifying with his opponent at the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it -- go there," he concluded one of the shiny discussions with Doneck and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in reserve, a former downloader pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests in Majdan.
He was in Doneck's last night when we had a conversation.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the Peruvian separatists shall be four and a half hours a day.
Current.cz: Perhaps you know that on the side of the Peruvian separatists fight the Czechs.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to 30.
There can be a lot more, though.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I've already released Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swedish, Georgians... but the Czechs are not yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we hit your prisoner countryman and could free him.
Ukrainian soldier occupied by separatists
A.cz: What do you recommend to the Czechs who join the Peruvian separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian flags of volunteers and separatists take care of them, they will be shot without mercy, just like any other stranger.
Separatists consider these men to be hired debtors, and according to them they deserve nothing but death.
For example, if the Ukrainian soldiers take over a group of Donetsk separatists - and so do the Czechs - they will put him behind bars and deal with him as a prisoner of war.
That guy's going to survive soon.
The Ukrainian side is also acting as a state in war.
And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand that well, then they'll swap it.
Some sources say it's over a hundred men a long time ago.
We've long stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we just freed them... didn't save them from the war if they decided to continue in the fight.
The rescuers are doctors in war, surgeons, but we definitely don't.
That's right.
And every day there's another and another.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, or four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be about exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to let prisoners go, and it's just a human request.
A.cz: It is reported that in a few months you have gained great authority and even confidence among the Peruvian separatists... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both sides of the war?
It's a hard question.
One of the officers in Kyiv gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe it's also the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Civil Service, I've got some authority before.
I'm never smart, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever's going on, I'm honest with you and I'm telling you the truth.
Even if it's a Ukrainian government, or a doll or a Luhanan very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're tortured and killed.
And that it's a crime.
Often, though, I risk my life, even when I'm incarcerated... this job for me can mean the end... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many corrections and tortures do you know?
... (a long gap) Ukrainians and separatists are being desecrated in order to torture prisoners.
I'm sorry.
What about the repairs?
You're only playing on the side of the doll.
I don't have any information about the fact that the Ukrainian army is also repairing the prisoner.
No indication that the Ukrainian army is allowing anything like that.
We have an idea of how many corrections we have, but I can't and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the Peruvian separatists.
There are officials among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are seeking independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least they say so.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarians anymore.
Separatists already have oligarches full of teeth and are their unbreakable opponents - to life and death.
As we say, they've eaten up to their throat.
The same dreams and complaints people made on Maydan, by the way.
And now I'm wondering a little bit: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other rather small.
Now this sentence of mine is hiding an insurmountable conflict within itself.
A.cz: For example, how does one of the strongest leaders of the Peruvian separatists, Igor Bezler, appear to you?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I'm without a gun and I show soldiers or armed men naked.
And they always have me on both sides of the two hundred or three hundred feet on the fly or in the optical focusor.
Those faces of the people who are looking at me, I see them all the time... and they can blow up their guns at any time.
Excavator, experienced Colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian official, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small government in the great Russian Empire.
In any event, he talks about it all the time, and Ukraine thinks of any misunderstanding.
He said there shouldn't even be such a state.
At the same time, he is an insurmountable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarians.
A.cz: When we're talking about characters - in a discussion show of Ukrainian television, you've marked your Prime Minister Arsenija Jaceňuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader", who would do the best if he left quickly.
In those three hundred meters, I'll always get at least five fears.
So why should I hide from the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is damaging our country?
Do you think he's involved in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians of Jaceňuk are nicknamed "the queen."
And the queen is not in the Ukrainians' eyes as an animal from which she would be afraid or should have other respect and authority.
His behavior directly duplicates the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, to ask him, to play with him his intrigues, to threaten his position... he must run the country, manage it and protect it during the war.
When the country is threatened, there's no primal claim for family, friends, rest for payable emotions.
He's the first of Ukraine's ministers.
What about Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's always complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the galaxy couldn't save markets
The traitorous 3 Sylvester Stallone returned under $30 million from the $90 million budget in the United States and Sin City: a woman for whom I would kill only $12 million.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz during the first weekend earned only $14.6 million and also movies for children like How to train dragon 2 were for film disappointment.
According to the article by Robbie Collins' film critic in Telegraph, children's films are of their own quality.
Collins marked 2014 as the " worst" year of children's films and how to train dragon 2 called only "functional" continuation.
When it comes to films set on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average annual film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas during the period between the Day of War Victims and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of viewers and film critics indicate that this year's film crop is of similar quality as last year's hits.
According to some commentators, there may be a change in the access of viewers and a higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who currently works on Disney’s Jungle Book, said: “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to pursue what has already happened.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood cash marketers, Netflix’s profits were $1.2 billion thanks to Internet services, which is almost twice as much as last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the study for relying too much on the rights to comics, and predicted that Hollywood would be "depressed".
In the light of the current failure, some commentators say that there may be something on his catastrophic work.
With the introduction of possible large cash flows in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultran, Minimons and Jursk world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
Producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked a decline in markets for simply "cyclical". For Hollywood Reporter said: "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash market in history and nobody will worry about selling."
KLDR again threatens Soula, fires another short-flight rocket
North Korea fired another short-flight missile into the sea, Soul announced.
The reported missile test was carried out shortly after the end of the joint United States military maneuvers and South Korea, which Phjongang considers to be a preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang lies in the northwest of KDLR at the borders with China.
According to the DPA agency, the South Korean Ministry of Defence stated that the shots were fired from a location in the northwest of the KLDR and flew some 200 kilometres away.
North Korea thus apparently fired a rocket from the province of Chagang for the first time, launched a South Korean media with a call to military circles.
In the province there is an underground firefighting ramp for missiles of type Scud.
This is another series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea carried out an unusually large number of missile and firefighting tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, opposition protests against the NATO summit in Newport took place.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the centre of Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to a council meeting in Cardiff, which was described as an anti- Summit.
Stephen Fairclough was watching the situation during the weekend and was talking to Protestants who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be transported by air from Blue Mountains
TWO young tourists were picked up and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen-year-old girl and eighteen-year-old man took a trip to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't come home, the relatives called the police around eight o'clock at night.
She was sent to a patrol station, including local police and rescue team, and a few were found near Bridal Weil Falls about eleven o'clock in the evening.
The girl broke her knee and the man fell and fell into the head.
Policemen stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, they were transferred by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
The breaker brought from Opava only point, he had a win on your leg
The 23-year-old fora could decide, but he didn't succeed in two of the biggest odds.
After the goal was to shoot three minutes before the end, but it ended up at the street corner of Opava Joseph Kwietonov.
I had it on my feet. I have to give it that chance.
I'm mad at myself," your ass slept on his head.
"I should probably have put it up under the age, it was a bit of a mess," he said.
Sigmy's defense of the Opava didn't allow much, except for Mikul's 11-minute drive, which covered the golman Reichl.
Then they began to push the Hanács, but the guards didn't let them in the block and shot them from a distance.
Fifteen minutes we were comparing, and then we took the initiative.
In the second half, we were better, we had more of the game, and Opava was only threatening us with standard situations.
But your chance has not changed, and so it ended 0:0," hated coach Hanák Leoš Kalvod.
Opava also took the point due to the absences in a facility where, in addition to the two injured, Petr Vavřík and the three-point shooter Petr Ševčík, who are visiting Slezska from Sigma.
Unlike her former policy, she couldn't get in.
The substitutes deserve absolution.
Sigma acted more football, but until one standard we did not let her go to anything," coach Slezanů Petr Baránek said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
The remise is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma's remise got to four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the boss of the club Joseph Lébra, who, after defeat with Znojme, conditioned his million contribution to the treasure of diametrically different performances in other games.
"We realized Mr. Lébra's warning, so it can't be that the boys don't want to fight," Kalvoda noticed and to the address of your sleeping shooter, he added, "I believe it's coming and it's going to fall there.
But after the first match, I'll get him out of here so he can save himself for another fight," Calvoda laughed.
Al Pacino twice attacked the Benaths.
The film festival otherwise faces the crisis
After a huge excitement over Birdman's opening film, whose director Alejandro González Inárrita took the lead among the serious candidates for the Golden Iva, the next day gave evidence that the interest of the 71st year festival in Venice had dropped somewhat.
Whether it was because the number of seats in the largest room increased to fourteen hundred, or because after Birdman there were criticisms recognized, but for viewers less attractive images as a genocide document in Indonesia in the 1960s, in view of the silence and other films with social themes from the American 99 homes after the Iranian story, there were soon empty seats in the cinema.
Heroes of comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet covered the gifts as in the past and has apparently ceased to be the problem of getting a place in the hotel at the last moment.
The crisis is being discussed in Italy more than anywhere else, and it is no wonder that it has also reached institutions as well as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not show a lack of personality, but only in relation to films.
While younger fans sought autographs by comic superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully played dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event for all generations was the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacina.
Plus, he flashed it in two movies right away.
In the story of the exhibition mentioned outside the competition, recorded by Oscar Barry Levison according to the novel Philip Roth, Pacino has a 40-year-old role that is close to him: players at the top of the fame that suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him immediately on the second day as a strange owner of railways from the rural town of Manglehorn, filmed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best acting should not miss it - but does Pacin's artist still have a price format?
Perhaps for him the greatest satisfaction is public love, and especially Italian, because even though he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his parents came.
Body for Italy
The rest of the Italian film runs very well in Venice this year.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first image of Birdman with a remunerated long shake.
The Mafia's calabrian heritage is looked into by the family relations between clans who fight each other for power and money, and the director was able to settle all the assumptions for a good movie: a quality script, camera, music and toys.
He also took on the role of chamber psychotriller The Cold Heart that filmed Saverio Costanzo and Albo Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost her own child with her happiness.
On the contrary, French competition films did not include the warm reception of both the Compendium for Fame and the 3 hearts, both of which are based on the traditional model of consumer films based on the popularity of actors.
But finally, two really excellent movies, Birdman and Black Soul, aren't that small at the first half of the festival.
And despite the fact that the festival pictures have all sorts of depressing themes, the new picture of Peter Bogdanoviche named She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy mentioned in Venice outside the competition and recorded in the style of American joys in the 1940s, has been able to lift the mood for more than one day.
Police caught four producers of pervitin in Prague, drugs vehicles from Poland
"The detectives detained in the past days three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a five-year-old woman who produced and sold pervitin drugs in Prague from November to August," said police spokesman Jan Rössler.
First, on Tuesday, August 12th, the attack unit in Cihlárska Street caught an organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who appeared in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a drug dealer.
On the following day, the detectives detained on the basis of the previous agreement of the State representative of another member of the group, a seventy-year-old.
The last of the four police officers arrived in the middle of the morning on 20 August in the area of the Malesque burning", the speaker said.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a third woman received drugs
The main organizer had a wide field of action.
In the part of the airport, in the garden house in Horomeric, in the apartment in Konjov Street and elsewhere in Prague, he produced pervitin, provided various aids and chemicals needed for his production and provided transportation of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the manufactured drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold pervitin.
With the transportation of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs, he has been helped by a woman who has not been punished for five decades.
For this she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs produced," Rössler added.
On the basis of the judge’s order, criminals also conducted several home visits, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, payloads, syringes, needles and other aids and articles that can be considered as complete equipment for the manufacture of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"Then, from the available records, the police found that since 1995 the main organizer had been sentenced to seven times in total for property crime, the woman who was sentenced was not," the police spokesperson added.
The latter was detained in 2006 on condition that he was convicted of a criminal offence of sexual abuse and that the seven-and-a-half-year-old motorcyclist who has been released was sentenced to nine times in court since 2009.
Even with him, it was mainly for the crime of property.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a criminal offence of illicit manufacturing and other dealing with fraudulent and psychotropic substances and food, which threatened them to ten years in prison.
Finally, three persons were asked by the investigator to encourage the State representative to propose the release of the link, where the judge finally placed them," the speaker said.
The fourth defendant, a seven-and-a-half-year-old relapser, ended up free.
His position and role in this case was not as basic as that of the other accused.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferrari's offering wood and carbon chess.
Ferrari offers within its other products very interesting things for a lot of "interesting" prices.
As a good example, it may be used in Italy to make handmade chess with a 42 x 42 cm playing board.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is 43,405 CZK.
The customer shall obtain a set of wooded black and red laminated figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibres.
It is unlikely that anyone will be surprised that players have a striking horse figure instead of a classic rider.
If you don't think of chess as a sufficiently valuable gift, you also need a Ferrari 500 F2 model made (of course manually) in scale 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 Kč.
It doesn't make any sense to drop out of high school or high school.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics also show that gymnasists have good applications.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In the last 14 days, there have been major preparations in schools.
Most of these are routine matters, such as the transfer of flowers from the summer warehouse back to the class and the pheasant.
They're gonna have a little more funnel in the high school.
A few days before the season begins, the furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature are searched for in the library.
There was no robbery or denial, the four-year high school in Goric after three years opens and renews its activity.
Not on the public, but on the private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of the founders.
They had to wait to see if the existence of a school would be confirmed by the registration of schools managed by MSMT.
"The French socialists should shut down and put France in order," says key association Francoise Holland
Valls calls on the left to "show her support" to the military-in charge of the Socialist President whose new division of functions did not meet with the consent of most of the French.
The President deserves general respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to remain on his side," he said and raised a condolence.
As a peaceful gesture, the president of the government insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour work week, despite the passionate agreements by Emmanuel Macrono, a new finance minister who proposed to release the rules at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Holland asked the Socialists to remain "consistent" with the government.
Christiane Taubir, Minister of Justice, but she made a turn in the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist Members, where she criticised the Socialist Party for "the French have lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Penová, a leader of extremely conservative rights, with a constant internal dispute between the socialists when she declared that she did not assume that the new Walls government would last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls too. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new doesn't last until the end of the winter or the winter," Le Penová told her favorites.
She reiterated her call on Parliament to dissolve and said that she was convinced that it could win the early elections and that she was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections and in May, extremely conservative rights prevailed in elections to the European Parliament.
According to a survey of the public weekly Journal du Dimanche, 76% of the French think that the Socialist Party is at risk of being divided into several rival groups before the end of the Dutch term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon have patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but the public opinion must think that the situation is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art Prague no longer limits elections
Amendments to the relevant declarations should be prepared and approved until the new management of the capital.
From the streets of Prague there will be no more games before the municipal elections and the city will not limit street art.
There will be no restrictions on the marriage of dogs.
Prague will not reach October elections to prepare and approve the amendments to the relevant declarations in its representation.
"The change decision should also not make the current management of the city that ends in several weeks' term of office," said Councillor Lukas Mannhart (TOP 09).
A total of several councillors, such as Prague 5 and 7, decided to abolish their gambling in their territory in the past few weeks.
But Hern's not going to go away. The gambling announcement is not going to change yet.
It's the task of new city leadership after elections.
We would not technically achieve this now, for example, due to the deadlines for commenting, and so on," Manhattan explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representative, which must approve the amendment of the declaration, would take place on 11 September.
The referendum on a flat ban on gambling will take place on the day of the municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, for example, there is a ban on gambling in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the statement will not change in the case of street art, so-called search.
In particular, he complains about Prague 1, which has already sent to the magistrate a proposal for places that would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians also don't want Prague 5 around Angela.
The announcement concerning the closure of dogs in the city is going to be a few months, so far it has not been completed.
The location of the heren and the problem of searching solves city announcements.
They may only be issued or adjusted by the representative of the capital.
Counsellors only have an advisory vote, they can't make their own statements.
Last week placed the victory of the Scottish independence proponents to reach the hand
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake a shock when it almost put on billboards throughout Scotland asking whether Scotti wanted to be rich.
But you will not get into the hearts of the Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor will you get their respect when you start threatening them.
The morale of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, although only a few Scottish people still go to church today.
Scotts have a far greater tendency to avoid replacements from the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
The head of the Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, so in the television discussion he repeatedly questioned his rival, Unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people", if Scottish voters voted for independence, and start supporting a single currency for Scotland and England.
It made Darling choose between Scottish civil society and London finance, and he fell into this trap with a grism.
Of course, Darling doesn't support the mandate of the Scottish willows.
However, the debate on what Scotland will have is already largely neutralized.
What really motivates the Scottish voters is fairness, employment opportunities and the defence of state health that citizens have free of charge.
Darling supported the London banker in monetary matters and also raised the idea that he would not protest against privatization of health.
As Salmond said, he went into bed with a cannery.
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish volunteer knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with a conservative.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to the voters, but to the "boss" association, to the Confederation of the British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameroon's refusal to discuss independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmon was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a scared missing house.
Scotty would respect him if he came to debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scotts don't jump and have to accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic school start according to Miloše Urban
Illustration of the story Longest Year
Miloš Urban Longest Year
The end of the holiday was at all the best, the last week that was gone, and we were just crashing and crashing with Grandma's summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes when you can get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the quick arrows, already falling down, climbing up the hill around the Imperial to the back behind the Vary, somewhere in tennis courts, there was no weather, the sun cooled the back and shoulders, the paprika fell on the divorced.
Tonight, a slight nervousness, still a holiday, sleeping until mid-twelfth, in a week it will get worse, just before the sleep will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then get up at half seven in the morning.
It'll be Monday.
Most people don't, on the contrary, this summer is being brutally slandered in front of school.
Adhering in the spectacular light on the plate and looking like a plastic frame in a glass weight, there is the school, U.S.A.
An obnoxious pink cloak, and before it old familiar faces and a few new ones, the boys are more attractive, the girls are more prying.
They're grizzly, avoiding them, they're just as interesting, they're unmistakably holding the band together and they're here soon.
And these grown-up girls who came screaming, they're laughing at something hysterical now, maybe something changed in their lives over their holidays while everything's at my old age.
And the new primers, some nervous and some other pleasure, why are they even coming here?
Because it has to be an educational war obligation.
So inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolgirl with mope, unfortunately still the same as the one who borrows the disciple keys from the tablet box, where they can keep the textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress stays in memory, now it's not, it's pretty airy, but it'll be worse in a week.
It's the only way out of the show that a stomach is playing and it's starting to get a headache.
A chapter that worsens the math lesson, that devilish game for the chosen, between which I am not and will never be.
Again, the three and four, there are no five, hide before the temptation, fall into the lap and best submit, be there, exist only as a name in the classroom, and dream so far stories about nicer girls and beautiful buildings, about antennas in the universe where no one competes with anyone, humiliates no one, and shocks no one's foot.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
The daughter of her birth had her own daughter die.
She is threatened with an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in a public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without the help of a stranger, she was born a girl who, after cutting her ass, had packed into a ready-made blanket and hid under a jacket and had taken her to a road hauler where she had been put into a few dozen metres from the road.
She was born on her way to school.
I guess it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I needed to go to the bathroom on the bus, and I was born there.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the poppy rope with the knives I was wearing at school," she described the defendant and said she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The next day she went back to the place, put the child's body in the trunk and drove away, took the body out of the trunk, packed it into a black igelite bag and hid it and left it under the stairs of her grandmother's house in Havlíčkov's boat," she complains that it is not quite obvious when the death of a newborn came.
It could have been in ten minutes, but also hours after birth, suffocation when covering the blanket or putting it under a jacket, under-cooling or bleeding from an unchained ashtray.
A similar scenario was repeated next year in the spring.
A woman near the unknown time from February to April 12, when the infant’s mortality was found by random witnesses under the hook at a fisherman on Havlíčkobrodska, gave birth again secretly.
This time in the bathroom of the basement apartment in the family house.
Without checking whether she had been born alive, without cutting and folding a doll that was wrapped around her neck, she put a child into several plastic wraps, including a needle bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his former partner were taken to the fisherman.
She was finally hit by a friend.
The father of both children was just a friend accused, but apparently he didn't know about the partner's pregnancy.
Even for this reason it is not now before the court; it was only punishable for a sin against the funeral law.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like him being punished as a partner.
With the child he manipulated against my will.
I know that my solution was wrong, but it came to me as human at the time," she was not hiding the resentment of the accused, who allegedly was subject to and feared him in relation to the man.
During her speech, the young woman spoke fairly.
Tears flowed into her eyes until she spoke about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after she was very old.
She didn't want to kill.
"They follow me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she exclaimed.
I didn't do my equipment because I didn't want my kids, I looked young.
I wanted to put Furt in the baby's box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain that," she answered the judge's question.
However, she refused to act on the thought and intention of killing the newborn.
The second child, according to her claim, was also born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I did limit it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also restricted smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, all of her repeated questions claimed that she had a health problem that she was being seduced.
And that's a friend.
The main assessment will continue with the Court of Justice on Tuesday's statements of the Court of Justice.
On Wednesday, a verdict could already be made.
The woman is threatened by a criminal charge of up to 18 years in prison, if any, with an exceptional penalty.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching the three-billion-dollar redemption of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the whole matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings S.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the third largest shipping operator in the world, has advanced in the negotiations on the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately three billion dollars.
The Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, which competes with greater competition Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has allowed access to luxury passenger ships Prestige Cruises and rich customers.
The agreement may be published this week, published on Sunday's source, but noted that the negotiations still do not have to end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% share in Norwegian Cruise.
The resources did not want to be appointed because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request for a comment, speaker Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise is based in Miami operating thirteen sailing ships in North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, by 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the signs of Oceania and Regent, which together own eight sailing ships to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced sales of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
It is expected that in the coming year, the ninety billion segment of voyages will benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India.
The companies are competing for these customers to become the preferred option for the selection of sailing.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public tender in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority share in the company since 2007 since the closure of a transaction of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it came to contact the tour operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of companies engaged in leisure and casino activities controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai.
In 2008, Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise.
The Norwegian Cruise launched a stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration of regulatory authorities by the end of June, Genting owned 28 %, Apollo 20 % and private investment company TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to the registration documents, the first public tenders include Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises as a whole 82% of North American passengers.
Pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong provoke the Chinese authorities on the day following the vote decision
There was a group of loyal people near Beijing who had a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National Congress on Sunday approved that only two out of three candidates participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first receive the support of the appointing committee, which is likely to consist of members of the faithful Beijing.
For opposition democrats, it is almost impossible for this decision to get on the election cards and to introduce pro-democratic activists to renew the promise and protect Hong Kong's financial centre from the "Central Occupy" movement protests.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, and Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on the Chinese government in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists organised an informal referendum on the elections in the special official district and hundreds of thousands of people entered and occupied the city business district.
The press conference to be held by Prime Minister Li is organised by the government in Hong Kong and by the Chinese contact office in Hong Kong.
During the day, several press conferences were also to be held by the Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Zhang Ronghsun Legislative Commission and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong State Council and Macau Feng Wei.
Student activists said they were meeting in front of the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kyiv to start negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a description of the events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin requested that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately initiate negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the isolated areas.
His spokesman Dmitrij Peskov later explained that Putin did not intend to point out that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian-speaking region would be given power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call on the Kyiv government to deal with the Peruvian rebels as equals is in line with a clear strategy, according to which it is driving from the outbreak of the riots five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorus real independence so that it can connect the West with Russia.
In the interview for the first state television channel Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern areas of Doneck and Luhansk, which ruled separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently occupied territories have been designated as "Novorusko" or "New Russia", a term referring to the famous pre-revolution days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, according to which "prison illusions" everyone who believes that peace negotiations are under consideration, because Ukrainian politicians started before the parliamentary elections on 26 October, while government units attack civilians in the areas of controlled separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately initiate meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and the status of the state sovereignty of the Ukrainian South Sea," he said.
Peskov said Putin's attack on state sovereignty has been conceived in the context of wider autonomy, which has been led by Kyiv for several months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas about the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Sandov stated that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern region.
It is not about the issue of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal Ukrainian conflict."
The failure of the speaker Kremlu to correct the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's remarks highlighted the Russian leadership's approach to resolving the emergence of separatists in the east, which is different from the open-ended presence of Crimea, where most of the two million people are from ethnic Russians.
Moscow should be much more difficult to annex even Doneck and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and public opinion polls, which have been conducted before the conflict, have shown broad support for the suspension in Ukraine.
The autonomy of the Russian diplomats at international forums would empower the regional governments in Ukraine to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, thus giving Kremlin a real control over the territory that would connect the Russian fortress with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is home to the main Russian maritime fleets, the maritime commercial land and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also the centre of down, factories and slenders, which make important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his 7 June opening speech, proposed that the Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give the various regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs significantly from that of Kremlu and separatists. Moscow is accused of armaments and incitement of violence.
Putin's last call for Kyev to act as a separatist following the next rebel procedure last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
The separatists of the Russian forces took control of Novoazovske so that the Ukrainian security authorities feared that it would be drawn to occupy strategic coastal areas up to Crimea.
This has made a huge civil and military effort to strengthen Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants lying between Novoazovska and a narrow entrance gate to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poršenko took part in a meeting of the European Union’s leading representatives in Brussels and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of a further unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday that the Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovakia after last week two colonies of Russian armed vehicles and 1,000 military units entered the Donetsk region to support the separatists.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers arrested in Ilovakia during the Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday by 10 Russian attackers arrested in Ukraine a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
In the scandal with discovered photos are also complicated Australian celebrities and Gabi Greece
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his contempt for hackers who probably stole the intimate photos of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after being celebrated in the biggest scandal with hacked photographs on the Internet series of explicit photos by Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims to have sixty photos with naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevenne, singer Rihanna, Ariany Grande and Ley Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Because of the escape from iCloud, the public allegedly also received personal images of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahowski and Melbourne actress Greece.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for his hand last month, told the Confidential magazine, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greek, who is now in New York, reported to online reporters that hacking is "unsatisfied" and that those who have become his target "are subject to humiliation".
It's supposed to be that the hacker got 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures on top of the pool that he unwinds.
Palmer acted for example in the movie Love and honor where her opponent Liam Hemsworth was.
Palmer, the star of Chuck Strahowski's TV series and the actress from the Sucker Punch Browning thriller last night didn't comment.
The representative of Lawrence TMZ said: "It is a clear violation of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen hacker criticised on his Twitter: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The footballers Sigmy Lebra got better, even without winning
Holomouc - Chromium and the lightnings that the co-owner of the Holomouc Sigmy Josef Lébr sat on his subordinate last week seem to be past.
Even though they brought only a point at the end of the free remise from Opawa.
The deployment and battles of the club boss have only improved a little.
Money for payouts could soon come to the club.
"I'm going to have another game, as I talked about last week, but I'm far more optimistic," Lébr confirmed, despite Sigma's failure, her players were convinced by the improved performance.
The fight and the bet with which we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In such a case, I'm able to forgive that he won't win.
If we were to play like this from the beginning of the season, I'm sure we haven't lost yet," Lebr thinks.
Sigma in Opawa stopped the initial domestic pressure, then the game was balanced and in the second half was already better.
After the victory, Calvod’s men won, but they did not reach their goal, so they couldn’t win.
The result, though, is not according to our ideas.
To our full satisfaction, we missed only one chance,” said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the approach of the footballers caused only his threat.
There must have been more aspects.
Whether on my side, on the side of the coach or fans," Lebr said.
With the pressure, Sigma must be counted
The players did not want to comment much after the game in Opava last week.
I'm trying to put these things away completely.
I tried not to let it happen," the young bartender Michal Reichl bowed his head.
Without any comment, he then left a question about Lébro's statement from last week's attacker Václav Vasíček, who did not change Sigma's biggest opportunity in the Saturday match.
But then he just talked a little bit about the pressure.
We'll still be under pressure.
They're all trying to pull on us.
Today we've shown that if we fight and all ride the ass, it'll go," he said.
Warnings came to the heart
Even Leo Kalvoda's gaze did not suggest that the preparation for the match was not the easiest in view of the atmosphere that was prevailing in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to the heart.
Even though it wasn't before that they wouldn't want to fight and put it off," a break coach said.
It was like today's first 15 minutes.
It took us a while to compare it with the hardness and realize what the other league is about.
That it's not just football, it's mainly combat," Calvoda said.
There's only hope that in the next match, Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe it," he added.
