She knows exactly what she wants.
Hello.
Did Tom forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning, time to wake up.
The baby worked all night.
She didn't like to live in the city.
This size is too big for me.
It won't change anything.
Do what you want.
That man you saw yesterday is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf in spite of the rain.
What's the test?
He told me the story of his life.
I decided to be happy because it was good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
The teacher's teaching.
What do you see in him?
What do you see?
That's not what you think!
You can buy a dog at that store.
He likes sweet tea.
You have to do the same thing.
It's simple and intuitive.
How many hours do you work a week?
Yeah, you.
They're not helping.
Please contact me when you get to Boston.
She asked me who came first.
Sooner or later we're all gonna die.
How long will this take?
It's a shadow.
Where is the German Embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is wonderful.
But he knew it couldn't go on.
Probably not.
I want it, too!
She's looking at nothing.
He can't eat anything sweet today.
She ate.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I got five years in prison.
I didn't.
Any universe that is simple enough to understand it is too simple to create a mind that can understand it.
We didn't have to rush.
Excuse me?
It doesn't matter which team wins the match.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Go back to your car.
Get her some salads.
We're fighting.
She didn't answer.
I heard Mary wants divorce.
Is this a pus or a pus?
Tomorrow, my father is coming home.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
Never give up hope.
Can you give me a bath?
This book belongs to the libraries.
I want to die with Getter Jani.
We make cheese and butter out of milk.
When I was in high school, I spent six hours every day in the morning.
You guys are the best cops.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful!
I'm sure you've done this before.
Did you get a letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't really play basketball.
What's the difference?
You're guilty.
She rejected my request.
To whom do you give priority?
I like Korean food.
I was invited to the south.
You're still green.
There's nothing here.
You never know what's going to happen in the future.
We produce a variety of strawberries.
Everybody likes dolls.
What did you do to deserve this?
Look at the example above.
Her note seemed very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Can you be nine?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't received his help, I'd be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why did you come here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom is still not here?
Millions lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence with that on the board.
She's happy to meet him.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like how he speaks.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I've learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Do not wait too long.
That brown liver is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Close the door.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your place.
Be friendly.
Isn't it a wonderful morning?
At least it's a story.
I have more and more hairy hair.
He turned off the light.
I'm insomnia.
The sky is blue.
The old woman fell and couldn't get up.
After the movie, they're asleep.
You can use my dictionary.
I want to talk to your uncle.
You like Tom.
He rarely stays at home every Sunday.
When would you like to see him?
Thomas started calling for help.
His son was eight.
If I had any birds, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
When did you hear the shot?
I forgot to buy one thought.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't go now, we're going to have lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old noose.
Eat some bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Thomas is not allowed to speak English.
The school is five kilometers away from my home.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be delicious.
Please come.
Women change the world.
The pressure on the floor in Singapore is considered to be a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the chair.
We need more sugar.
The scent of roses filled the room.
Bad luck sometimes.
Tom has already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're guilty.
Who are you looking for?
What does that mean?
Apples on the other side of the wall are sweeter.
Who's there?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
She had a woman’s head, a dead body, a bird’s wings, and a live nest.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I was afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If you don't, let's go.
Who's coming with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry now.
I'm going to France for a vacation.
You can sit wherever you want.
You're an engineer.
The door was opened slowly.
It's a story.
Are you engaged in any sports?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you about is living here.
Please just go.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and you'll see a black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clear the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I talked to friends.
All your cats are gray.
I remember the time when you and I had a date together.
When we go to sleep, we say good night.
The scandal has ruined his career.
Cats are complex for individuals.
He was so poor that he couldn't buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know I know.
Get back home by 6:00.
Bread fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be worse.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candles lit up the room.
I'm sorry.
Fold the paper through the side.
What does he say in his letter?
The woman ate the bread.
I ate apple.
A single person receives pleasure by observing the swarms of insects.
Who's that man sitting at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
Now I'm really tired.
His steps have accelerated.
I'm afraid of the endless silence of these endless spaces.
Why do you need a new look?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take your hat off when you get into class.
They don't do anything more than complain.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me when you get to Boston.
Thomas rose at seven o'clock.
This is us.
Listen to the radio.
A boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate all the pizza alone.
You need to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tommy.
How are you?
Your trip starts here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Thomas could not stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
When should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new store.
Everyone knows her.
She's incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Thomas started.
I can't.
Get out of class.
There's three dogs sleeping on my mom's bed.
Thomas has already completed the work he needed to do.
If you can't have children, you can always win.
That's what I thought.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still couldn't get on the bus.
They need friends.
Feel it, please.
Can you blame it as a gift?
Do you like living like that?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Don't you really have a home?
Are you playing chess?
Her boyfriend is Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There's a lot of cheers in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girl?
I don't have a family.
Fathers expected too much of their son.
What would you like to order, sir?
He did it.
He went into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move!
You can sit on the chair.
Where do you live if you don't have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all students like English.
That test was so difficult that we did not have enough time to finish it.
That's all.
You have to work fast.
If it is believed that society has created nothing of value, it can be said that it is believed to be a mass destruction.
English is spoken around the world.
All their efforts were pointless.
Where's the mirror?
This girl doesn't sound bad.
Life is unfair.
Each person paid a thousand dollars.
Gile's the only girl in our club.
The students should not go to school today.
The sun went down in the sky.
His parents were happy with his success.
Now it's our house.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get home.
He helped me fix my watch.
No one's worth helping me.
John doesn't know what to do next.
He suffered from severe headaches.
I want a dog.
I have to find my pen.
Nigeria was once a British colony.
Don't put stones in the river.
I'm good at teaching Germans.
She paints her room white.
I can't go until he comes.
I invited her to dance.
Have you done your homework yet?
John is a French literature professor at Oxford University.
Do you understand what he said?
What color do her hair look like?
The sooner you get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to start your trip?
Your watch is ten minutes late.
They betrayed you.
I thought you said she was yours.
How much money do you have hidden after your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm an Irishman.
Here's the man I've been waiting for.
He didn't pay the debt and started.
Mr. Brown is very good at speaking Japanese.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like to watch baseball and football.
Everyone but her laughed.
The queen stood by the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She's my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Today, Thomas seems different.
What is the price of the room?
We have to get out of here.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How did you learn the language of those waiting?
They're not a threat.
Her advice moved me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does this tour visit?
That's why we played inside.
Your rise is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't meet you tonight.
Thomas has a sister who's a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
Tonight you look just beautiful.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom's redesigned.
The orchid is hot, so be careful not to get offended.
Did you find your letters?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember if that room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessories to women.
I don't like to lie.
It's not theirs.
I'm not used to getting up early.
Get where you are.
The house is her.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you sure?
You were busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What music does Thomas like?
This tree grows near her house.
Don't talk in the reader.
How are you doing, panel?
I'm changing the yen into dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Thomas is going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I were rich, I'd give you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where the hell did you fuck them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time right now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This rise is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why didn't anyone eat my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She put it literally.
What a wonderful night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She's taking them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
No one believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the question.
I never want to be indebted to anyone.
Look at the train running through the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
Now I'm really tired.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I've got thirty bucks.
Her note seemed ridiculous.
She's too young to understand.
I bought this suit just for this occasion.
It's similar.
Be careful, okay?
It's the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Don't you know the way?
I like that very much.
Tom's gonna need help.
I printed hundreds of pages.
I can see and hear.
Don't forget the ticket.
Put your hand up before you answer.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true that you have a gun?
I slept in the bed all day yesterday.
The war ended their investigation.
When the spring comes, the days become longer a day after the day.
I'm listening to the radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car alone.
It's Tony's book.
I needed to come early.
Tom only ate what he wanted to eat.
Who stole this apple?
He threw his ticket into the movies.
What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like this summer.
What's your address?
She was lying on the bed face down.
African drums are bigger than Asian drums.
What I've always said.
He heard him crying at midnight.
Please bring me a glass of water.
He grabbed her hand.
Eat the bread!
If God did not exist, we would have to create him.
You should do it yourself this time.
My family was very kind to me.
You don't understand.
It has green eyes and bright red hair.
Does Thomas have experience?
She left her seat on the train.
I'm a vegetarian.
You have to go there.
What's the reason?
I don't see anything out of here.
Since I didn't get the answer, I signed it again.
She's standing outside the wall.
Don't trust me too much.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I drank one beer and I drank a lot of alcohol.
Thomas didn't think he needed a personal guard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her go into the park.
I can't believe you're busy.
You didn't look like you wanted that book.
I have a red bike.
It's low and thick.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was exhausting.
He's much smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
It's a terrible air today.
I didn't want this to happen.
This one's trying to get out.
Like I said, I'm not gonna do anything.
After that, there's a little red dog on the table.
Stop them.
Anna likes chocolate very much.
I know Mike likes the bag.
I've got to blow up a whole bucket of apples.
He died two years ago.
Take the chair to your room.
Taxi turned left suddenly.
Yeah, I get it.
I'll be there in ten minutes.
He was accused of murder.
If you don't go to school, you don't get anything.
If anything happens, call me quickly.
Would you like to eat some fried potatoes?
Is there any danger?
You're dangerous to swim in this river.
My friends are wonderful.
Gold won't buy anything.
We have enough water.
Who will inherit the throne?
She worked hard.
Don't be afraid of change.
Please open this box.
Is it healthy to eat fish?
My baby wants to talk.
I asked her what music she likes.
There are no Witnesses.
Is she satisfied?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
She started without documents.
I've been here a lot.
She continued to speak.
Mike's not good at playing baseball.
Coupranugars are often used in the wilderness.
Maria is a bookie.
Good weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready?
I'm happy I'm not a woman.
Stop wasting your time and go back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is that your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
To be happy is perfectly normal.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
Yesterday, my hand was hurt.
If I had been rich, I'd have given you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My father didn't eat much fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed me and wanted a good night's sleep.
My friend's here.
Where do you live now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn the language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not all people like dogs.
I'll stay here for a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I can do that.
Is that true?
She's crying.
I'll see you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took the family to the zoo.
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
That's equal to half the nine.
This car was manufactured in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make him a photo robot!
Your brother wasn't at school today.
Thomas will never be around you.
I was in Canada at the time.
I made this food myself.
Write the pen.
Someone wrote their name on the wall.
Who can just turn in the wrong direction like that and turn around.
They don't have sugar anymore.
I love your daughter.
Tom hopes he'll stay and not eat again tonight.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get a telegram?
You shouldn't be swimming in that tank.
When do you get rid of the snow?
He thought I was very tired.
I think she doesn't eat anymore.
Either you're with us or you're against us.
Please help me!
Tom knows she likes Mary.
I like this music.
She's exhaling the dog.
He went to the store, but he stopped at her house.
Snow is moving fast.
We're eating here.
Of course, I should read this book.
Thomas is not in prison right now.
Tom and Mary went to the museums.
The ship was heading for the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who repent.
I can't work when you're standing there.
Marie had lung problems.
We were one big happy family.
What color car did she buy herself?
The kid spent the whole night.
Do you see me?
She testified against him.
My father's growing rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I got through the window.
Meat's not ready yet.
Give me a piece of gear.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Can you turn on the light?
He doesn't trust the doctor anymore.
It was the first time I visited the museum.
We've spent a great deal of time.
I think Thomas wants to sit down.
What a beautiful family.
Are you still in Florida?
You didn't have to eat those green fish.
Get ready! Tomorrow's the last day.
We looked through the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The Swedish capital is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I don't understand.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our teams have been missing mobility.
Cat's over the street.
There's a mirror.
Why don't you help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a widow.
I saw him.
I was teaching Lozbana.
"Good morning," said Thomas laughing.
My hand hurts.
He needs a dig.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
There are seven days in one week.
You have to take your own way of life.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He was lying down, and he didn't just take it.
They work eight hours a day.
I eat and drink.
I do it every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy right now?
I'm gonna take away everything I said.
Where'd you get all those keys?
I went inside through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly recorded our names.
Our son died during the war.
It is not satisfied with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell you who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We're better than all
Who is that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going shopping.
Everything that's genius is simple.
Her students learn too much.
Tom raised his hand.
Let's go for a swim.
Birds leave for the south.
This tea is very tasty.
I don't agree with her.
I'm guilty.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
That's a wonderful idea.
He's very proud of his toy.
That'll be enough for us.
I'm not really afraid.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania accedes to the European Union.
I want to be a speaker.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry about what I did.
She's become an honest woman.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took the piece of the tie.
Let me do that.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and enter the fresh air.
Did you ever catch a snake?
It's tough.
Did you see my mom?
I know his name.
Thomas doesn't want to live like that.
Do you agree with what she's doing?
He came here before he finished his lessons.
You know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her bed was on my bed, and she didn't want to die.
There are a few good hotels in the city.
What's this letter from?
He doesn't want to learn today.
We're all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like to lie.
Be careful, okay?
I bought a camera for $30.
That's great.
It's no method, it's a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
The water is very sequential here.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I fell from the pits.
He learns to tempt people.
Bob's washing the inns at the time.
My brother is two years older than me, but he's three centimeters lower than me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Don't you see my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Thomas will be dead soon.
I'm used to going to sleep late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My apartment on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We're basketball players.
These clothes are good for you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know you're stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care.
Thomas could not find the reason why he needed to return home early.
Put your hand up.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I can't believe you were busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand what we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I said I'd call each other later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs it more than she needs it.
Nice exits!
Tom, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
It's not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city centre.
Now you can turn the radio off.
Now you can turn the radio off.
You're a very loving man.
Ankara is in Turkey.
You're a very nice man.
I was in Boston several times.
You're a very nice man.
