The honourable Members are concerned that they will be confused with the "papers"
Some Members expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This concern arose in relation to the plans to change the name of the Parliament of Wales.
Members throughout the political spectrum worry that such a thing will sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party said that his extension concerns that "I will make a parallel with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of the Wall: In the Walls, the word "twp" means "ass" and the word "pwp" means "permits".
One Pleiade said the extension was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
One Wall conservative stated that his extension was "open-mouth" about the change of name, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "map".
In this context, the w-word is spoken in the same way as the English word for yorkshire in the letter u.
The parliamentary committee, which is currently drawing up the bill for the adoption of the name change, said: "The final decision on any name to be called by Members will naturally be the case of the Members themselves."
The Royal Government Act 2017 gave the Royal Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted as Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of the Members, the Commission has been drawn up in favour of the name "Member of the Parliament of Wales" or WMP, but the choice of MWP is the one that has achieved greater support in the public consultation.
Members are obviously proposing alternative options, but the attempt to reach consensus may be a difficult case for the President of Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the next few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes in the functioning of the Parliament, including rules of withdrawal from parliamentary office and the design of the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the issue of their name during the debate on legislation.
The image of Macedonian citizens on the referendum on the change of the name of the country comes to the fore
Voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was called for in an effort to resolve a decade of conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that its northern neighbour's name conceals territorial views and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Gorge Ivanoff, President of Macedonia, a war of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaef, claim that the change is just the price they have to pay for their EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's campaigns are silent as the churches in Harlem disappear.
"The older people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in each corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's none of them."
He said he understood the reason the bars disappeared.
"The world is being socialized differently today," he said.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood salon where the world is regularly frequented."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not hold as long as the competent authorities hope "and will return soon or late to the point where they started".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by multi-houses full of people who will not be willing to help the places of worship left in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people who will move to these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The early Methodist Church left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that was close to home took possession of the building.
The possession of St. Martin's building took over a black church under the famous John Howard Johnson, who went to a boycottage of the 125th Street stores, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson’s uniforms took over the reconstruction and ordered the carriage.
Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's church called the caravan "the campaigns of the poor" proudly.
The expert who played the carione in July described it in a different way: a "political treasure" and a "replaced institution of historical importance".
Specialist Tiffany In from Michigan University also noted that it was the world's first karione played by black music, Dionysius A. Linde, who was transferred to the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meigueder said St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What is happening in the last few months in St. Martin is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the local church leaders, and others by the bishop.
The prosecutors - the governing body of the unity, which is made up of the people's leaders - sent a letter to the bishop in July concerning their concerns that the bishop "will endeavour to transfer the cost" to the body of the commissioners, despite the fact that this did not interfere with the recruitment of the architects and the contractors sent by the church.
Some of them complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the audience.
Cancer attack at 13-year-olds in California
Carcharia was attacked and injured by a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during the landings for the port fishing in California on the first day of the time of the bridge, according to the principles.
The attack was recorded just before 7 am near Bikon Bitch Beach in Ensinitas.
Chand Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was making calls with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child's cries for help and approached a group to get it out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a scream of excitement because he got caught up in the dark, but then he realized he was shouting "Something touched me!
Something touched me!"
The whole key had been opened," Hamel noticed when he got to the place where the boy was.
"I called everyone out of the water, 'There's a shark in the sea!' Hamel added.
The boy was transported by air to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The type of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Mariner Larry Giles said in the type sheet that the shark had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim brings serious injuries to the upper part of the body.
The authorities prohibited access to the beach from Poto Bis in Casablanca to Sumis in Ensinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Gils noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's projects exert pressure on the US cosmetics market
The Sainsbury's are measured with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by placing cosmetic strips corresponding to those of multi-stores with special staff.
In the context of the significant volume of the US cosmetic market of £2.8 billion, which continues to develop while sales of clothing and household items are falling, the largest cosmetic tyres will be tested at 11 stores throughout the country and spread to more shops if the operation succeeds.
The investment in the field of cosmetics comes as supermarkets are looking for ways to refill the space on the reefs that once understood televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that they will double the size of their cosmetic offer to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing series of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees there will also be more space with scratches with the company's logo, like those stores like Boots.
The supermarket once again launches its own series of boutique makeup so that most products are vegan - something that increasingly demand the younger consumers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try to place its products at two Sainsbury's stores, one that opened in Croindon, South London, last week and the other in Shelly Oak, Bermiham, later this year.
The electronic markets and the trend in the market of small quantities of food daily in local retail markets mean that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Cup, Sainsbury's CEO, said that outlet stores will look more and more like multi-stores, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more off-food services.
The Sainsbury's put outlet Argos stores in hundreds of stores, while also imported some Habitats as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported sales of types of furniture and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to update the cosmetic and pharmaceutical parts failed.
The Sainsbury's tried a partnership with the Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a debate on how to distribute profits from pharmaceutical stores to the supermarkets of the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold the pharmaceutical company that placed 281 stores in Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, over £125 million three years ago.
She said Lloyds would play its role in the project, adding an extended range of luxury processing companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our reefs to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained personnel who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to cover every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a possible destination for the cosmetics that doubt the traditional way of markets."
Peter Jones: A stranger after Holly Wiloby's departure from the 11 million-£ agreement
The winner of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is crazy after the departure of the Holly Wiloby TV show from the 11 million £ agreement with the lifestyle company he has to dedicate to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoby doesn't have time for the clothing company and accessory True.
Their business was similar to the Goop company in Guinette Paltrou.
The 37-year-old exhibition "This Morning" announced to Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Wiloby made the first of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, out of their winning lifestyle business at the last moment, in order to dedicate himself to her new huge symbols with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became mad when the golden girl of the television was admitted during a conference full of tensions on Tuesday at the central offices of his empire in Marlow, Buckighamsayr, that due to the new symbols - worth £1.5 million - he would no longer have enough time to make sure the company had the type of clothing and accessories True.
The company was similar to the Goop of Guineth Paltrou and appears to have doubled Willoby's assets estimated to be £11 million.
After the 37-year-old Willoby announced on Instagram that he was going to leave True, Jones flew out of Britain to some of his estates.
According to one source: "Truly was far from Holly Wiloby's top priorities.
It was her long-term future, her source of income for the next decades.
Her decision to leave has surprised all those involved in the company.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products in the central offices in Marlowe ready for sale."
Experts consider that the departure of the exhibition "This Morning", which is one of Britain's most commercial brands, could cost millions to the company due to the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing, as well as further delay in its presentation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's wife have been in close friendship with Jones and Tara Cap's wife for ten years.
Willoby founded True with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined March as president.
Couples spend their vacations, and Jones maintains a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television producer company.
Willoby is going to become the main person in M&S campaigns and replace Ad McPartlyn with the I'm A Celebrity show on ITV.
A source from Jones' narrow environment said last night, "We wouldn't want to comment on his professional affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He was jesting about the criticism he received from the media about a school that some would consider inappropriate for a president and about his positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trab make so many concessions?
Trab said he's missing the TV show.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by the Trab as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ray Young-Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "response" from the United States after the early disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trab kept a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We're almost at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have now built this excellent relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had given positive results - ending the fire tests, liberating the ants and returning the rest of the American soldiers to their homes.
While supporting his unusual attitude to his statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a "presidential" suit, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people here," said Trab, showing the crowd in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia strike an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their passage
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was announced that foreign non-governmental organisations would not need assistance.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population was displaced, there was no national disaster, a necessary condition for the use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has become clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is quite difficult," said Mrs Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palus, it is not yet certain if foreign personnel can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Bureau of Natural Disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palus to determine whether international organisations were allowed to contribute aid.
In view of the seismic attacks often affecting Indonesia, the country remains extremely unprepared against the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Athens, the same does not happen on other shores.
The apparent lack of an alarm series for tsunamis in Palus, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
In the best case, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters are even more complex in administrative care.
A large hospital that had been parked in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is headed for Palus, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joco Weidondo was at the centre of the campaign's election campaign to improve Indonesia's disorganized infrastructures and invested a lot of money to build roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding is worth the management of Mr Joco before re-election the following year.
Mr Joco also accepts pressure from the persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where the members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives, and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using swords, spears, and arrows, as well as other self - directed weapons.
Watch out: Daniel Steridge of Liverpool is exaggerating against Chelsea
Daniel Steridge saved Liverpool from an attack at the Premier League against Chelsea with a bullet at 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steridge accepted everything from Serdan Sakiri about 27 meters away from the end of Chelsea with his team losing 1-0.
Hit the ball on his left and shoot at the back of the drawer.
His efforts were very high from the large area and ended up on the right in the networks.
The ball finally fell over Capa Arizambalaga, which jumped to break it and entered the networks.
"I tried to take this position, get to the ball and players like Sakiri always play as fast as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," said Sterize at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kande approaching, I made a direct change, I didn't think much of it, and I did the sweat."
Chelsea had a 1-0 run in the half-year after the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Azar.
The blue attacker gave everything with the tacun to Mateo Kovacits in this game, before he gave a cockroach near the center of the field and ran to the side of Liverpool.
Kovacs made the two in the center of the ground.
Then he gave a deep balm, driving Azar to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defender and finished by sending the ball to the back of the dock with his left suit in front of Alison Baker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight against Naples at the Champions League's 3 m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The tragic calculation of the deaths from tsunami in Indonesia amounts to 832
The post-terrorist and tsunami compensation in Indonesia is 832, according to the country's natural disaster service statements, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-degree earthquake that struck the area on Friday and created 6-metre waves, said the service representative Sutopo Puruo Nugrohos at a type interview.
The city of Palus, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the buildings that had been destroyed.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect after the murder of a woman with a knife
A murder investigation began after the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenheid, Mercyid this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mouse in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police asked the locals who saw or heard something to deposit it with the police.
Officer Brian Haegan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I would like to address a call to anyone in the nearby area around John Street and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to address a call to anyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the planes from the Dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have in their possession information that is vital to our research."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenheid and was found inside a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they can meet the woman came to the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are under way as the police have stated that they are in the process of informing the nearest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mouse, in his attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was silent when he found out what happened.
The tenants were informed that it may take hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer was supposed to tell a man that the whole area was currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up with fingers on the stage.
They kept saying, "It's scary."
At 2 a.m., two vans of the police were located through the police cord and one outside.
Policemen stood outside the cordon and watched the polygamy.
Anyone who has any information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously in 0800 555 111 on Case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's slogan in Parliament is the last memory affected by the Philony for the "rewrite of history"
His eviction would be a poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works by his fanatic Puritan supporters.
However, Comrade Cromwell described Mr. Crick's proposal as "an attempt to restore history" and "an attempt to restore history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Assembly, said: "In this debate on the removal of the babies, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's form outside the Westminster Enactors would not be targeted.
The iconoclassion of civil wars in England was neither banned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestors in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornichroff is characteristic of his image in the 19th century and part of the history of a personality that many believe is worthy of tax.
Mr Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Kromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as an advocate of Parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
This is an absolutely accurate case for an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is a recognized personality that represents one side of the disunity.
His achievements as Lord's Protector are also worthy and worthy."
A pig-killer wounds a deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer accepted an attack and was killed by a pig on the market in Southeast China, according to local news reports.
The man, who was only known as "Wyan", was found with a cut artery in a lake near a pighouse on the market in Liopopanswei in the Guitsow province, in South China announced Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig labourer is preparing to make pig vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Zining in the province of Kinhai, China.
He must have traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a nearby pighouse.
He said there was a large male pig in the pighouse with blood in his mouth.
The medical examiner's examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had injured the farmer fatally, according to his report.
"My cousin's feet were killed and bent," said his cousin, known as "Go," according to Guyang's evening news bulletin.
The security camera plans show Oan to enter the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Owen or his cousin.
One market manager said in the evening news sheet that the pig has been placed in a cage to avoid attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene of the attack.
The Wyan family and the market authorities are going to negotiate some compensation for his death.
Although spanishly, cases of swine attacks in humans have also been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, seriously hurting the man.
Ten years ago, a 295 - kilo [295 - kilo] pig threw a farmer in the Wallia on his tractor until his farmer's wife scared the animal to get away.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was torn apart by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "depletion".
"They just have a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to do any harm.
We just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The remains of the rose storm are going to bring widespread rainfalls in the Southwestern USA
According to predictions, the Tsunnah Rosa suffers as it moves above the coldest water masses on the northern coasts of Mexico.
However, the Rosa typhoon will bring devastating rainfalls to the North Mexico and the Southwestern USA in the coming days.
The wind power of the rose storm reached 85 mph, constituting Category 1 storm at 5 pm east, on Sunday and found 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
The Rosa typhoon is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a region of low air pressure has begun to form above the Pacific Ocean and to move east to the West Bank. As the Rose storm approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture to the north in the South West USA.
The Rosa typhoon will bring rains of 25 million in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the nearby low air pressure region will create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Local rains of 2.5 to 10 million will cause dangerous floods, floods and possibly desert settlements.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates that are close to 5 to 7.5 percent per hour per place, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Frogs of between 5 and 10 million are expected locally in the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Floods are possible with a sharp deterioration of the phenomena due to the wide variety of tropical rainfalls.
It is recommended to avoid any movement by foot into the desert in view of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfalls can turn the ponds into steep rivers and floods will cause local floods of wind and sand.
The low air pressure region will create some locally strong rainfall on the southern California coast.
A total rainfall of more than 1 percent is possible, which may cause low rainfall and road ossitivity.
This will be the first rainfall of the liquid period in the region.
Some scattered tropical bridges will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early mornings on Monday, before the scenes are extended late Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rainfalls will spread in the Fort Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, some sharp temperature changes will be observed across the US as temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in tropical zones they remain quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very intense temperature changes at close distances.
A typical example of the intense temperature differences between the Central US was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and the U.S.A., Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent high temperatures will be observed and will spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern USA, October is expected to start at high temperatures at 27 °C from the Eastern plains to parts in the Southeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for the time, there are several possibilities to observe temperatures above the average in the Eastern US until the first half of October.
More than 20 million TVs watched Brett Caveno's hearing
More than 20 million television viewers have been watching the motion for a motion for a motion for a motion for a United States Supreme Court for Brett Caveno, the Fifth and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which is due to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blazey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with television networks, to disrupt the regular flow of the programme for the reversal of the last moment of Friday: the agreement by the Mayor of Arizona Jeff Fleick for a week's investigation by the FBI in relation to the categories.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he's 100 percent sure about how he was at a party while he was a high school student Kavano attacked her while he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes.
Cabano, in a loaded statement, said it was 100 percent certain that something like that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's measurements, it is likely that more than 20.4 million televisions will be heard on Friday.
The company recorded average television on the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The numbers were not immediately made available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of television viewers watching a broadcast from offices.
To see this television in its right dimensions, it is a common size similar to that of a football match of the side-of-the-side or the Oscar award ceremony.
The Fox News channel, whose journalists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanos, was ahead of them with an average of 5.69 million televisions during the whole day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In the second place, there is the ABC with 3.26 million televisions.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Fleick turned out to be a champion in Friday's drama.
Following a statement by the Republicans that he would vote in favour of Kavano, the CNN and CBS cameras signed on Friday morning protesters to welcome him as he tried to enter the elevator for hearing from the Court of Justice Committee.
He was looking low for a few minutes while he was being tried, alive on TV at CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Fleick said his office had made statements and, before closing his elevator doors, that he would have more to say at the Commission hearing.
All cable television and broadcasting networks were alive a few hours later, the vote of the Committee on Justice of the House on the promotion of Kabano's candidacy in the plenary of the House for voting.
However, Fleik stated that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, something that was requested by the minority of the Republicans.
Fleick was partly convinced after discussions with his friend, the Democratic Party's chief, Chris Coons.
After discussions with Kuns and some other lieutenants then, Fleic decided.
Fleik's choice was valid because it was clear that the Republicans would not concentrate on the vote for the approval of Kavano without conducting an investigation.
President Trab asked the FBI to investigate allegations against Kavano.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of leaving the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and subjugated national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Burma, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her in the newspaper's headline, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has been deeply critical of the Brexit Checkers project, saying that the proposal to collect duties between Britain and the EU was "excellently unreasonable".
Weid Sims Shooting: Police seized suspect Dayon Simson for the player's murder in LSU
The police arrested a suspect of the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dayon Simson, 20 years old, was arrested and detained in a second-degree murder facility, according to Baton Rose's police department.
The authorities have in their hands a video from Sims' complexion with Simson and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Policemen located the glasses in the scene of the crime and said they found traces of Simson's DNA, according to the WAFB who cooperates with the CBS.
After Simson's investigation, the police said she admitted to having injured Wade fatally.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by East Baton Rose medical judge who circulated Friday, the cause of death is the injury from bullet to head and neck.
The Ministry has made available to the Louisiana Police a dedicated working group, the police crime lab, the police forces of the South University and the citizens of the region to assist in the arrest investigation.
LSU sports director Joy Aleva welcomed the local law enforcement authorities for "research and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-highford grew up in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 riboids per game last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Want Wade basketball team said the team is "consolidated" and "in shock" from the death of Wade.
"We always worry about events like this," Wade said.
Efascist ash emissions to the city of Mexico
The equestrian ash emissions from the Popocatepetl equestrian came to the southern neighbours of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to stay away from the mainland on Sunday, after the state's activity reached its peak, with 183 gas and ash emissions recorded within 24 hours.
The Centre was following various indications and small seismic vibrations.
Pictures in the social media show car umbrellas covered with minute layers of ash in the neighborhoods of Mexico City like Sochimilo.
The geospatials observed an increase in the elephant’s activity at a distance of 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a earthquake of 7.1 rupees in central Mexico in September 2017.
The equator, known as Don Gogio, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan self-nomists in view of the vote on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following a protest in favour of independence with the restorative units, as thousands participated in the demonstrations for the first year of the vote on the abolition of Catalonia that caused the city.
A group of masked demonstrators for independence, held by the restoration units of the class, threw eggs and oxen into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually covered by tourists.
Congestions were also noted later during the day with policemen to use their clubs to create complications.
At times, groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence called the slogan "We do not forgive, we do not forget" against groups of protesters in favour of the unity of the country called "Ask Spain".
Fourteen people were treated with micro-traumatics observed during demonstrations, according to the local type.
The tensions remain high in the region that supports independence one year after the proclamation of the 1 October referendum as illegal by Madrid, yet celebrated by the Catalan autonomousists.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although the origin was low with those against independence to boycott the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police authorities tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region where violent complications occurred.
Groups in favour of independence camped early Friday to prevent a demonstration of national police support.
The demonstration was carried out in other ways and was forced to take a different change.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrologist who participated in the protests for independence with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope for the prospects of Catalonia to gain its independence.
"Last night we lived one of our most brilliant moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy who were able to vote, but now the situation is stable," he said.
Despite the fact that they had a victory of vital importance, although limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties fought for independence to maintain their strengths this year, with many of their most famous leaders to have been excommunicated or detained in waiting for their role in organising the referendum and the following declaration of independence.
Joan Pouch, a 42-year-old engineer who signed up with his cell phone protests in favor of the police, said the conflicts were fueled by politicians and both sides.
"The tension is escalating more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunker, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were detained last year, announced his candidacy in the European elections for the following year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to complain about the suppression of democratic values and the oppression we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
London: Arresting man after car crash in the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash in London.
The incident took place at Bolinaghard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemings said damage to the doors and the building itself was caused.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's hit won a 1-0 victory in Livingstone against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first victory for Livingstone secured victory
The broadcasted Livingstone surprised the Rangers, pleased Stephen Jared just his second eight in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox group.
The hit by Dolly Menga made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed the level with the Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team is out of the league in this season and faces the Harts, who have the eight-degree race next Sunday.
Before this game, the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna at the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingstone in the middle continues her race in six games in her category, with the main coach Holt not to have enjoyed any more than when she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone loses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead a long time before he scored, with its incompetence to put the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and was about to get there shortly before the end, but Alan Litgou was disillusioned with his efforts by gliding Craig Halcket's head away from the end.
The farmers let the Rangers want to play in front of them, knowing that they could throw visitors at the free beats and the corners.
And that's how the big ball came.
The Rangers couldn't prevent a free hit, and Livingstone opened the opening, Dean Gallagher and Robinson worked together to send the ball to Menga, who took it all and scored from the center of the region.
By that point, the Rangers had ruled in the possession of the ball but found the defense of the peasants immeasurably and Terminator Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morello took off the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was blown off by the Rangers' security guard Alan McGregor's feet and all of Litgou went out to another free hit in Livingstone.
There were a lot of sit-downs in the Livingstone area and they were constantly being knocked down, while two pens were asked - after the Bales were fired by the Halket against the replacement player Glenn Midleton and one by the hand - who were rejected.
"Excellent Game" by Livingstone - Analysis
Alexander Lammond from the BBC Scotland in the Toni Macaroni Arena
Thematic performance and results for Livingstone.
All, in particular, were excellent, exceeding expectations in this course of course.
The style of the game and their personality changed little after their return to top form, but the bills should also be given to the Holt for the encouragement he gave to the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halckett was excellent, returning an excellently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joy Werell on bail throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, had no inspiration.
As good as they were in the past under Gerard's guidance, they didn't respond to these standards.
Their last game was missing - only once they managed to pass the peasant defense and this is a warning campaign for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the class.
Feelings of Reception of Erdogan in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the heads of state of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They have come up with issues such as human rights, type freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to start a new huge mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police excluded the concentration of the crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were of Kurdish origin - also gave the present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The dispersal of protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by certain Turks as heroes and by others as dictators.
Motor vehicle accident in Frankfurt: motorcycle death after car crash
A biker lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Detroit, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance's rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The conflict took place a few months after a similar incident in which a driver hit and left a rider who lost his life on the Chillders Street street, about 1.6 miles away from the accident on Saturday.
The Police stated that the authorities are making efforts to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
The roads have closed and the roads of the buses have been abandoned, while the drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisons: Six police officers were injured in complications
Six policemen were injured in riots that broke into high-security men's prisons, according to the statements of the Prison Directorate.
Terrors broke out in the prisons of His Long Lartin in Worstershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still under development.
Special police forces called "Tornado" have come back to deal with the riots, involving eight detainees and who appeared in one wing.
The police were hospitalized with micro-traumatics in the face during the complications.
A prison representative said: "Specially trained personnel have taken over the incident in the prisons of His Majesty Long Lartin.
Six staff members were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may be subject to a greater penalty."
More than 500 detainees are detained in prisons of this Grand Lartin, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the Prison Director was hospitalized after an attack by a detainee.
In October of last year, the correctional units were called to prison for serious incidents during which staff members were attacked with bats.
The Rosa typhoon threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas with drought may benefit)
It is rarely a tropical stretch to hit Arizona, but this is precisely likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remains of the rose storm will cross the southwestern parts of the desert, bringing floods to their passage.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued emergency flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa’s typhoon is expected to pass right over Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cycles have remained in a tropical storm or low barometer in less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a typhoon within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest U.S. National Tyre Centre models provide for a rainfall of between 2 and 4 inches, with individual rain waves of up to 6 inches in the Mongolian Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the South-West States, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, rainfalls of between 1 and 2 inches are likely to occur, with the possibility of individual total rainfall waves up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not at risk from the floods, the rain brought by Rosa can be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, a part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the South West states are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Monitoring Centre, more than 40 per cent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought," weather.com said.
First, the Rosa typhoon will reach the shore on the Baha California peninsula of Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the storm, Sunday morning Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour and will move north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the shore in Mexico with tropical storm intensity on the afternoon or the night of Monday.
A severe rainfall may occur in areas of Mexico, which will cause a significant flood risk.
"There are expected total rainfall of between 3 and 6 inches from Baha California to the northwest Sonora, which is likely to reach up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early in the morning of Tuesday as a tropical low barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach South Yuta late in the evening of Tuesday.
"The main risk expected by the rose storm or its remains is the very severe rainfall in Baha California, the northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern States of the United States," said the U.S. National Tyre Centre.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and snowflakes in the deserts and settlements in the northern plains.
Attack on Midsomer North: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as a suspect of attempted murder after the identification of a 16-year-old who suffered knife injuries in Summerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excellent Terrestrial region of Midsomer North, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two-year-old, and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Randstock area, Aveon and Somerset said.
The police call for anyone who might have recorded on a video on his cell phone.
Trab says Kabano "lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavano is a vote to reject the extreme and exorcising orders of the Democratic Party," Trab said at a concentration in West Virginia's Wiling.
Trab stated that Kabano "lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of showing him as a candidate.
Cavano put up with Congress on Thursday, denied indictable and with apparent incitement to the claims of Christine Blaisey Ford that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also put a hearing in front of her allegations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the greatness, quality and courage" of Caveno that day.
"The vote to confirm Justice Kabano's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a legal person with an excellent public service path," said the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The President spoke directly about Kabano's candidacy, while speaking about the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the interim elections.
"We have five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but it's really like being," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates."
Trab reported that the Republicans are on the mission of "resistance and prevention".
The first important procedural vote in the House on Kabano's candidacy is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, the CNN referred to the senior auxiliary leader of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were drawn from the giant waves that saved the shores, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Soluwesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palus on Friday, when waves six meters high came to the shore, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their passage.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-Richter earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, the world was still on the beach and it didn't run immediately, so it was hit by it," Sutopo Puerto Nugroho, a representative of Indonesia's BNPB disaster management service, told Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come to him, drove cars, trees, houses, hit everything in the street," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people crawled into the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palus.
Air photos published by the disaster management service show a lot of destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that have been destroyed and destroyed and a plot surrounded by water.
Transfers continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Implementation Service (BPPT) reported that the energy released from the great earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the individual bomb that fell in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The city’s geography, which is at the end of a narrow bay, could have grown the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that victims were found trapped under the wreckage of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were ignored.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage may be greater along the 300 km north coast of Palus, in a region called Dongala, which is closest to the centre of the earthquake.
The communications systems have "painted up completely and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," Red Stairs said in his statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
On Sunday, Thursday, criticism was carried out at the Service because it did not inform that tsunami had hit Palus, although according to officials the waves had reached the time of the warning.
In an erotic video reported on social media, a man on the top of a building sounds like he's screaming out in a panic trying to warn people down the road for the coming tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water is closing on the shore, diverting homes and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to immediately check the visibility of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major power stop, which cut off communications in the wider Palus area, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts from the authorities.
The army began to send transit planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the displaced still need undetected food and other basic types of first need.
The airport of the city opened again only to contribute to the relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Widdo's visit to the expulsion centres in Palus on Sunday has been scheduled.
The tsunami victims in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala managed to arrive safely in the city of Palus, where the workers found shelter in museums nestled in their front desk, they went through disaster scenes on their way, Mr. Dosseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief groups have taken on the sad task of starting the process of relief for the injured, some complain that it does not bother strangers, particularly experienced workers in the field of assistance to travel to Palus.
According to the regulations of Indonesia, the flow of financing, supplies and personnel from abroad may only be initiated if the place of a risk is declared as a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It continues to be a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Stairs.
"When the government says it is a national disaster, we can address a request for international assistance, but there is no relevant decision yet."
As the second day went by in Palus after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less ephemeral.
On Saturday, a little boy was brought back from an underlaw.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under shocks for two days, next to her mother's dead body.
Gendon Subadon, a coach of the national Al-Fat beach team of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing al-Fats for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Madaji, were his students.
"As the oldest in the sport of the alecite beach, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon was told how, when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was released in the community of the alexicptists, he began sending unknown messages to his opponents at the Palus who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, the sign next to his messages was a gray symbol "n", instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Stealers broke down $26,750 while supplying an automatic pick-up machine in Newport and Levi.
In the morning of Friday, thieves broke off $26,750 from Brink's employee who was supplying an ATM machine to Newport and Levi, according to a Newport Police Department type card.
The driver of the vehicle had expelled an ATM machine from the entertainment facility and was preparing to deliver other money, police officer Dennis McCarthy mentioned in the statement.
While he was busy, another man came running behind Brink's servant and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the point, according to the notice, but the police did not determine the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport police, calling in 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanie West is changing his name to Yee.
By announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one officially known as Kanie West."
West, 41 years old, has been listening for a long time to the irony Ya, and he used this nickname as a title in his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change was preceded by his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album titled Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her appearance for "sympathetic reasons," as the show's creator said.
Besides that it is a summary of the professional name he uses today, West had in the past stated that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think the word 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, in a discussion about his album title with the radio producer Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name is changed from Kanie, which means "the only one", to Yee, which is just a reflection of good, evil, confused ourselves, of all of us.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
It's one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known for various names, such as Paf Daddy, P. Ddy, or Ddy, but he announced this year that he prefers the names Lav and Brader Lav.
A former West co-worker, the CIA-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without letters and capital letters.
Mexico's elected president swears he won't use the army against the citizens
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military violence against citizens, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody student oppression.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Plattelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, armies shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, during a period that left student movements were gaining roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed himself to supporting the new Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are turning young people towards criminal federations.
The US should double the funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, says the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Fou Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes to be added to notices by various parts of the US government on artificial intelligence, as the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year to become the world's first innovation country on artificial intelligence issues by 2030.
"The increase in the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good principle, since all the other countries are so far away from the US and we are trying to make the next important discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The increase in the budget could double the chances of taking place in the US the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, Lee said in his interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order, released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading art companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an artificial intelligence system that won the best American player Othello, while later he was executive of Microsoft Research and chairman of the Google Annex in China.
Lee recognized the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Exploration of the Office of Advanced Defence Research Projects (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would be held to identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the best of the academic space, it's companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence issues in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that a green card should be offered automatically to teachers in the technical intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Development Plan for the Next Generation Disease Artist in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other government agencies share money with American researchers, but the quality of the academic project in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Disease Artist, to be joined by partners from the business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of an Chosen Commission for Disease Artist.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Institute of Sciences is investing more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made for months in the US legislation with the aim of establishing a National Committee on Safety and Health at Work.
Macedonian citizens are making a referendum to decide whether to change the name of the country
Macedonia's people took part in a referendum Sunday to decide whether the country would move to "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a categorisation on its territory and has been a veto at its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the national identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he will not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the participation will reach the required 50 per cent to be valid for the referendum.
The question on the ballot was, "You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece."
The advocates of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaef, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, to allow Macedonia's young people to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because so the lives of all of us will be safer," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote in order to become final.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Electoral Committee stated that there were no reports of irregularities up to 1 m.
However, the participation reached only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, so it currently gave 66 per cent of registered voters.
"I have come to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62 years old, voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoraf Zaef, Zorika's wife and son Dusco voted in the referendum on the change of the name of the country that would open the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union to the city of Stromika of Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes set by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head high, not as a second-class partner," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the expansive union."
Prime Minister Zaef said that NATO accession will bring multi-stakeholder investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaff said after he voted.
He mentioned that a positive result would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters, i.e. less than the required participation, would participate in the referendum.
According to another survey conducted by the TV station Telma TV of Macedonia, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent together with one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Soviet government, from its inability to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Guerrero spends all of Briton's defense to put on golf
Sergio Aguero and Rachim Sterling were in charge of Braiton's defense by winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Etishand Stedium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed himself to score easily at the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received everything in the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Briton's defenses before he left the open space.
Next, Aguero was found surrounded by four green players.
He went through with shyness to a defender, then escaped from a number of others at the edge of the large Briton area.
Then he gave everything to his left, finding Sterling.
English foreword made his first move to the area by returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to win the British Matthew Ryan thermoguard, scored on the right side of the network.
"Aguero is facing some problems at his feet," City's coach Pep Guardola told reporters.
"We told him to play 55 with 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to score golf at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Galazians the original advantage in Premier Lig's fight.
This gol came in at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Briton area at this stage.
She sent a beautiful ball along the left-hand side to Liroy Sane.
Sane held the ball and led Sterling to the back of the dock.
The Gala Guard hit the ball on the grid just before it went out.
City faces Hoffenheim in Chambions Lig's groups on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. in the Rain-Neckar Arena field in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sarger wants to win the Rockies.
Since the Nyasians were excluded from the side-offs, there was no reason for him to try to make another launch.
But the ever-competitive Sharer wishes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they still have any impact on the Rockies on the side-off, as they advance through a Los Angeles Dodgers game in the National Lig West.
The Rockies have gone to the beach with their victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock the first place in their category.
"A word we don't have to win, at least we can play by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will be a game of the highest level I'll face this year.
Why don't I want to fight in such a fight?"
The Nationals haven't yet announced who the original thrower will be on Sunday, but they tend to let Cerger throw the ball.
Serger, who will make his 34th launch, made preparations on Thursday and will play Sunday, which is usually a day of rest for him.
The right hand from Washington has a performance of 18-7 with an average score of ERA 2.53 and 300 out due to strike at 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trab is giving a speech in West Virginia
The President spoke directly about his elected candidate for the Court of Justice, Brett Caveno, in his speech on the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the interim elections.
"All we've done is in November.
We have five weeks from one of the most important electoral procedures in our life.
This is a very important moment, but I am not a candidate, but it is actually like I am and, for that reason, I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trab went on to say, "You see this sport, this disgusting racist group of Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have taken on the task of "resistance and prevention".
"And you've seen this in the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "enraged and evil, hateful and false."
It was referred to the Judicial Committee of the Senate by naming the deputy director of the Republic of Diane Finnstein, a reference which was accepted with possible public approval.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you discovered the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer, that was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad extension.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
It didn't surprise me at all that Momentum activists in my local group voted to fool me.
Furthermore, I am the last of a number of Members of the Labour Party who have been told that they are not welcome, precisely because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, had a similar attitude because he firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion for a lie was criticized because I argued with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, traditionally, for similar issues to those for which Jeremy had argued with previous leaders.
The invitation to the meeting of the employees of Nottingam Ist said on Friday that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation".
During most of the eight years that I am a local Labour Representative, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday evening were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more flexible, more sympathetic" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever really begun to be implemented.
It is increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I previously thought we had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 and adopt views that I would never agree with, whether they were national security or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke publicly, no matter what I really said, I heard a rumor in the social media, where some asked for my rejection, exposed the centre's policy and told me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my fellow Members, since the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a winter of sexual or racist assaults every day, but they never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how insults are now considered to be normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad extension and that with every proposal for a change in the rules of choice, the limits of the party are tightening.
I've been advised for the past two years not to raise a raise, not to talk too much, and so "everything will be okay."
But I didn't get into politics to do this.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student, because of the neglect shown by the government of Thacher, which has led mainly to my failure throughout my entire class, my aim was to provide better public services for those who need them more, either as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I've never hidden my policy and I've done the same in the last election.
No one in Northingham East could have been confused in any way with my political views and points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who have promoted the proposal of insulting Friday, the only thing I have to say is that, while the country is facing a Brexit that will harm our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on being faithful to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to the Momentum members in the Notingam movement, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political intention will prevent me from acting as I think it is to the best interests of all of you.

Ir - Melrose: 38 - 17: Irish Ir ascends to the top
Two late-gols may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that IR was worth winning in this extremely recreational today's tennis championship game.
He's now at the top of the class, the only homeless group in the ten.
Finally, it was her highest defense, as well as the best exploitation of the opportunities, which made the balance for the peasants and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tried our games so far and we're still rude, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrows said: "Congratulations in Ireland, opportunities were exploited better than we were."
Grand Anderson's ball at the 14th minute, turning Fraser Klimo, brought the Air ahead, but a yellow card to Scotchezo Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to exploit the digital advantage and Jason Baggot scored a ball without a change.
The climate increased IR's lead with penalty before scored, exactly in the middle of the year, a ball with conversion, leading IR to scores 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half-year well and Patrick Anderson's golf course, with Baggot's conversion, reduced the course to five degrees.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruard Nott, which was removed by a vehicle, and, after the resumption, IR also increased the difference with a bullet from Stafford McDoual, with climate change.
Deputy Chief Blair McCarson then took a yellow card and Melrose was once again exploited the numerical advantage with Bruce Colvin's gall without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The farmers returned, however, and, when Strowan Hatsson took a yellow card for a taclin in the climate without the ball, from the penalty line, McCarson scored a ball at the back of the attack that IR.
The climate has changed, as it has done almost again since the resurrection, since first, Kyle Rowe packed David Armstrong's cage and sent the Gregor Henry stretch away for the fifth floor of the peasants.
Still Game winner starts a new career at the focus
The winner of the Still Game ford Kirnan series is ready to jump to the focus industry after it has been revealed that a director of an licensed restaurant company has been appointed.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis's role in the popular BBC show, which he writes and is competing with his longtime partner at Greg Hempfield's comedy.
The couple announced that the next fifth cycle would be the last of the show, and it seems that Kiran is planning his life after Gageland.
According to the official registers, he is the director of Avingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, although a Scottish Sun source insisted that Kiran wants to deal with the "absorbed industry of the concentration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": the exclusive Bolivia hopes that the court will once again open the way for peace
They're going around in the fully-equipped head of the Navy in La Paz.
In public buildings, there are blue flags.
At the sea bases from Lake Titika to the Amazon is written the motto: "Our sea is legally owned.
It's our job to get her back."
In the whole closed by St. Bolivia, the memory of Chile’s coastline after a bloody conflict on the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century continues to be alive, as did the desire of its people to travel to the Pacific for once again.
These hopes have been lifted today more than ever, for decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Volivia has the strength, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course awaits the result with a positive eye," said Romperto Calzandila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of the Bolivian demonstration that Chile, after decades of constant talks, will be obliged to negotiate to Bolivia a major sea exit.
Evo Morales, the charming autonomous President of Bolivia, who gives a controversial fight for his re-election next year, has much to gain or lose from the decision of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide in favour of Bolivia and that, even if it did, it would not change much.
The United Nations agency in the Netherlands has no power to grant thousands of land and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be issued only six months after the submission of the final undertakings suggests that the case "was not complex", said Paz Zarate, Chilean specialist in international law.
And instead of further promoting the goals of Bolivia, last four years may have undermined them.
"The current government of Bolivia has raised the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morale's aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining good mood of Chile, he supported.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged letters since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velje, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision procedure was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end 139 years of disputes with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzandilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular leaders in Latin America, is using the issue of going to sea as a political dean.
"Volivia will never deny its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea declares there will be no nuclear disarmament if the US cannot be trusted
North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Yong Ho says his state will never disarm his nuclear weapons first, unless he can trust Washington.
Rey spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made by the heads of the two states during a summit in Singapore.
Rey made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeii seems ready to relaunch the nuclear diploma that had ended three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Young Won.
Rey states that the view that continued sanctions and the U.S. refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will sometimes force Northers to "grow back" is a hot night's sleep.
Washington is trying to agree to issue the relevant declaration if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament movements first.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trab want a second summit.
But there is broad speculation as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering declaring a weapon that the country considers likely to be the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeii plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trab Summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available at a store near you
If you want to grow the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop searching.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of foreign super-magnetic hats in the pasarela for their collection in the Spring-Callocay 2019 that stole the presentation at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Extraordinary bad hats covered the Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the pasarela.
The piece he left of Valentino was an excessive bez hat decorated with a flat handle with feathers that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other super-magnetic accessories there were pieces decorated with stones, a magic hat, even a pineapple, but these have not been designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, over time for Halloween.
Many of the multicolored masks had slender lips and were more prone to Hannibal Lekter than to high raptic fashion.
One creation brought to mind complete equipment of blowers and glass, while another was like molten ice in a corner.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach central commercial roads near you.
The super-sized hats made their appearance very quickly after La Boba, the search hat with the very wide power that we have seen wear so many, from Ryana to Emily Rataikovski.
The popular company that created the extremely rough hat that surrounded the social media sent another great creation to the pasarela, a bag of sand almost as big as the model it wears by wearing its mother.
The dark orange bag of raffia, decorated with raffia and a white leather handle, was the piece that escaped from the collection La Riverera Spring-Callocay 2019 by Jacquesmus in the Fashion Week in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitaz said in the column of FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing large hats and large beach bags at the shops next summer, as the designer made such a great feeling that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for super-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are needed for citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a pre-history in academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with another series of excellent results in the examinations, which have simply been further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are struggling to provide the best possible level of service to students and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher levels of education, the vocational course they will choose as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum by order, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice lesson in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, then what you say goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of the annual reviews, we find that languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved a degree of L.A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a degree of A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also had a degree A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered equally important with science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the EU Employment and Rights Committee in 2014 revealed that, as regards the reasons why employers found it difficult to cover empty jobs, a 17 per cent grade was due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the need for language skills is becoming increasingly urgent for young people to be prepared for their future professional career.
Since more future employment opportunities require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person will choose, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future because of this skill that he will be able to enjoy throughout his life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults in the US in 2013, 75 per cent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a discussion, while the French were the only language that spoke a double percentage of respondents (15 per cent).
For this reason, the investment in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the US with Horizons in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose from independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
The independent schools of Scotland provide with dedication a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, no matter what the future holds.
Today, no one can deny that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and preference for young people in Scotland.
They have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
Lebron will make his debut at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for the lovers who are looking forward to seeing Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers Luke Walton's coach announced that James will play Sunday in the first game before the fight against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is probably gonna play for a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six games that Lakers have to give before the competition period.
"I don't need preparation games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trab concentration in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trab begins a series of meetings from the Wilderness of West Virginia.
These are the first of the five planned meetings of Trab next week, which include periods in friendlyly scheduled areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his election to the Supreme Court to wait, the Trab seeks to strengthen popular support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trab's concentration in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trab concentration in the Wilding of West Virginia is scheduled for 7 μm. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trab concentration in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trab is likely to be referred to the hearings this week for the candidate for the position at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, which were held in a broad atmosphere due to allegations of sexual offences, with a vote of confirmation of the Senate pending for up to a week while the FBI's investigation is under way.
However, the primary objective of this series of mergers is to help Republicans who face a misconception in the November elections in order to gain some strength.
Thus, President Trab's campaign performance stated that these five meetings next week are aimed at "mobilising volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the members of the House of Representatives and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congression control is so critical of its agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible, as we drive in the multi-stakeholder campaign period," said a representative of the Trab campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The planned gathering tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Willing could bring supporters from "Haio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month that Trab visits West Virginia, the country that won with a difference of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trab is trying to help Patrick Morrisei, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is low in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisei that the president should come and try to give him an incentive to the imaginations," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the strength to fight by keeping the hopes alive as it leads to Sunday's singles
After three single-sided games, the four Saturday evenings may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The talented tails of the helmet are a perfectly designed sporting idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such measurements.
Where would they say the serum is now?
"There were six degrees ahead and now there are four ahead, so we probably have a little serum," Jordan Spith said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of going four degrees ahead and staying twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air on their beaches" and have a lot to encourage them, like the two Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one broke three degrees out of the four.
Spyth was deadly from tea to green and set the example.
The voices of the applause became stronger as he continued his round, achieving a crucial hit to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were below two after two.
The blow they won the game in the 15th was accompanied by similar demonstrations of their conviction that the American team is not alone.
"You have to look deep inside and worry about your game," said Spith.
That's what every player has left.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more degrees than both Home and Thomas in the last two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Flywood, Ryder Cup's unmistakable story.
The strange but precious two of Europe has succeeded in four in four and it seems that it does nothing wrong.
The "Molywood" was the only two that didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way energy seems to flow towards and from the noisy viewers, underscores the fact that it is players who should win Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flywood or Molinari to print a possible European victory while the sun is beating over Le Golf National.
Both preferably at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European dignity remains an early one.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they had Spain and Sweden so deep in a hole they couldn't get out of it.
But Sunday, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting games to watch them closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a group so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome game has also shown that the US team has the resources, despite the doubts of some.
Europe takes over 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after its tour of the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with 10-6 against the US.
Tommy Flywood and Francisco Molinari's inspired twin made two matches against a competing Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National so far at four degrees.
The European side of Thomas Byrne, who is trying to preserve the troupe he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, ruled the wrong American side in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The US was more opposed to foursomes, winning two matches, but couldn't cover the difference.
Jim Furick's side needs eight degrees of the 12 single Sunday matches to maintain the trophy.
Flightwood is the first European emerging player to win four degrees series, along with Molinari, also known as Moligwood, after a separatist weekend is just the second two to win four degrees in the first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having broken Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they joined their forces to turn a tired Woods and the American newly emerging Braison DeSambo into an even more powerful 5-4.
Woods, who competed in the two games on Saturday, showed random lightning explosions, but has lost more 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning fourball, returned to Henry Stanson's partner for the 2-1-octa foursomes of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, winning the first and third place in the world.
They did not all go well for Europe, despite the pleasant, sunny day south-west of Paris.
Three times winner Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas set up a two-degree trip for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a hard win 2+1 on John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to win the Poulter and Rory McKilroy 4-3 in the foursomes while they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a group could recover while missing four degrees in the singles, although because it's the coward, Furik is enough to achieve balance to maintain the trope.
However, after being in second place for two days, it appears that a reflection on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it is not going to be disarmed alone without confidence measures
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened the sense of mistrust against the United States and that his country is not going to leave its nuclear weapons alone under such conditions.
Ree Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" in the past year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the expulsion of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way of starting our disarmament alone."
While Rei repeated well-known North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to the possibility of a "staged" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea will be awarded as progress in the process, his statement was important that it did not completely rule out mononuclearization, as Pioning did in the past.
Rei reported to the public announced by Kim Young Won and Donald Trab at the first summit that took place between an active US president and a leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trab promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is officially trying to end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first "deliver" its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the calls to relax the hard international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on becoming "first denuclearization" and increases pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their goal by exorcising them, even putting obstacles to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ree said.
"The realization that sanctions can be passed on to us is a dream that they don't know us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Rey made no reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trab, which the US leader pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jein over the past five months and added: "If the partner on the issue of denuclearisation was South Korea and not the US, denuclearisation of the Korean regime would not have reached such an outage."
Even so, the tone of Rei's speech was very different from yesterday, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the goal of the U.S. home with ballistic missiles from North Korea was inevitable because the "Wicked President" Trab called Kim "a fireman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trab, who threatened to "completely destroy North Korea" last year, complicated Kim's courage to move forward with disarmament measures, but said that there must still be a lot to be done and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trab said he didn't have a timetable for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it's okay."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pionjang for the measures it has taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue to be intensively and unresolved until complete, final and confirmed nuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously approved the sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an effort to reduce the financing of Pionyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeii met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pionging again next month to prepare for a second summit meeting.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left the Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, to be accused by North Korea a few hours later of having "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea committed itself to meeting with Mun this month to dismantle a nuclear facility and also a nuclear facility, if the United States had "anticipated measures".
He explained that Kim told him that the "opportunity measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trab promised in Singapore and are promoting the embodiment of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow lessons on how to get enough rest
This year, a new study at Harvard University seeks all advanced students to sleep more in an effort to fight the growing mass culture of the night study by consuming a lot of caffeine.
One academic discovered that students at the number 1 university often do not know basic things, such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed the lesson, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the lesson after a talk about the effects of sleep loss on learning.
"At last, a girl came and said to me, "Why do I learn about this right now in my last year?"
He said no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," The Telegraph said.
The lesson, which began for the first time this year, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performances, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School, and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to include the lesson when it was found that students were falling asleep within the week to a significant extent.
Early learning includes a series of interactive work.
In one unit there is the image of a student sleeper, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routine.
In another unit, participants learn how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of inflammation, brain, depression, and cancer.
A university map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students directly.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," added Professor Chisler.
His culture to be proud of because you studied all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that falling asleep is a problem that is getting out.
The sufficient sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, exhaustion and stress, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep loss puts the brain in a pitiful state, resulting in a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chisler to plan the lesson, following one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He said his lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a lesson across the university.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to follow a similar programme before starting their studies at this particularly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chisler advised students to regulate a notification about the time they should go to sleep, as well as an alarm clock for the time of awakening, and to know the harmful consequences of the "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can decouple the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga puts golf in Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad out-of-the-seat attack, as Dolly Menga's suit led Steven Jarred's uncoordinated side to a 1-0 attack in Livingstone.
Ibrox's team wanted to mark her first victory off the seat of February's 4-1 triumph in St. John's, but Gary Holt's team just caused Gerard's second eight in 18 games as a coach, leaving the group eight degrees behind the Charts, which is the first in the Ladbrokes championship.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-year-old and the inhaled Rangers' roaster seemed unable to respond.
While Rangers now falls in sixth place, Livingstone ascends to third, with just a globular difference from the previous Hibernian.
And Rangers can also wait for other trouble, as then Calum Spence needed to receive first aid for head injury caused by an object that was blown away from the court.
Gerard made eight changes in the team's composition and destroyed Air in the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Libya 11" that took a degree from the Chart last week and would be happy to see how this cooled machine could blow up every effort of the opponents.
Rangers may have ruled the estate, but Livingstone did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first distance sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the middle didn't find the ball.
A deep-free suit of Kigan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halkett, but his partner Alan Litgou's defense was all he could do was send the ball away from the dock.
Rangers took control, but it seemed there was more hope than faith for the game in the last three.
Alfredo Morello certainly believed that he should have won a pen at 15's, when he was in conflict with Steven Loules, but the prosecutor Steven Thompson ignored Colombia's complaints.
Rangers had only two suites in the area in the first half of the year, but Ibrox's former terminal guard, Liam Kelly, didn't worry at all about Lasana Kulimbali's head and Obi Ejaria's subtonic suite.
Even though Livie was clearly below expectations in the first 34 minutes of the match, no one can deny that she deserved the victory for the effort alone.
And again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher smashed the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept his cold and found Menga who just finished the effort.
Gerard made changes in the half-year by pulling out Kulimpali and putting Ryan Kend. The change almost immediately gave up, as the finish hit the ball in Morello, but the impressive Kelly drove off his line to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to lure the guests into the style of the game she knows and enjoys, with the Litgous and Halkett to take away the one distant ball after the other.
Holt's side could have increased the difference towards the end, but McGregor dealt with Jacobs in the same way, stopping him before Lithcow's attempt by the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Midton, had another phase of penalty to the end, as he ran into Jacobs, but again, Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Goger cash
A page from the German Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: like today, 136 years ago and VALE ... the day in Germany the future natural Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Güger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the device that is now known as the Geiger meter.
A science pillar when it was time, the counter went through the sphere of the pop culture, such as the 1950 movie Bells of Coronado, with the champions of the incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a counter-gager, used to detect radioactive metal elements such as the sky.
When you wear these acoustics, you listen to the action of the people caused by radiation in the metal elements."
Evans: "Look, he's acting crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name continues its work.
New anti-carcinoma vaccine teaches the immunosuppression to "see" the problem cells
New anti-carcinoma vaccine teaches the immunosuppressor to "see" the problem cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immunosuppressive to recognise the problem cells during treatment
The method includes the export of immune cells from the patient and their modification to the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common to various types of cancer and then become their infusion again
A tested vaccine has positive effects in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine who taught the immune system to recognise the problem cells saw the cancer of her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the export of immune cells from the patient, their modification to the laboratory so that they "see" a common protein in many cancers, called HER2, and then the re-infusion of the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski, from the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Meerland, said, "The results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzofski explained, the HER2 protein "is the engine power for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and fat.
A similar approach that is being exported to patients and then "learned" how to target the cancer cells has been used for the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanie West defended Trab, wearing a hat with the MAGA suit, after his appearance at SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanie West was awarded at the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a foreign conference in which he nominated US President Donald Trab and said he would run a candidate in the 2020 elections.
After presenting his third song for the night, entitled Ghost Town, wearing a baseball hat with the slogan Make America Great Again, he gave a statement of discontent against the Democrats and repeated his support to Trab.
"How do you like Trab? He's a racist."
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
SNL opened with a sketch in which Matt Damon, with Hollywood's star, competed for Bret Caveno's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the complaints of Christine Blazi Ford about sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video with West's interruption was uploaded to the social media by comedy Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to frame West with this legacy.
West also protested to the public that he was not treated well because of his hat.
"I got bullied in the front door.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
I'm being bullied!
And they say I don't know what's going on with me," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "I don't know what's going on, I'm gonna wear his superman coat, so no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were appreciated at least twice by the public and SNL's factors seemed to be in a difficult position, Variety said, with a person saying in the magazine: "The whole studio held a death-sacrifice."
West was called a replacement for the last moment of singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused enough when he sang the I Love It dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West supported Kandas Turner, head of the conservation team TPUSA, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest spirits: IN THE EWARDS REPRESENTED TO THE OCHLO".
However, the show presentation, Karen Hunter, quoted West as saying that it was just "his own and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") who I think is interfering and exposing an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "the one previously known as Kanie West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Ddy's steps, also known as Paph Daddy, Paphy and P. Daddy.
Rapper Snoop Doug had changed his name to Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of the Prince music had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist formally Known As Prince.
Category of attempted murder for assault with a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old was accused of attempted murder after a knife attack on a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balichacomor, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Prosecutor.
The Star of Game of Thrones, Keith Harington, criticises the toxic malehood
Kitt Harington is known for the role of John Snow in the violent medieval HBO fantasy series, the Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor condemns the stereotype of his mother's hero, saying that such roles on the screen pass the message to the little boys that they should be hard to gain respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that "something is wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxicity can be combated in #MeToo's time.
Keith, who recently married his partner in the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted to having a "strong" view on the matter.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much, where did we make the mistake of the virginity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, about the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television can partly be responsible for increasing the toxicity of the pregnancy due to the male characteristics promoted.
Continue: "What is implanted and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they need to show such behavior in order to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Certainly something has gone wrong with our young people."
In the interview it was also admitted that it did not intend to play in any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "end in battles and horses".
From November on, Keith will be leading the life of Sam Shepard's True West project, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that his acquaintance with Rose's wife is the best he's ever had since the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in a row, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here and over," she said.
Rose was driven to the Gritt, John Snow's fallout, the character of Keith, in the Emmy Series award.
The couple married in June 2018 in Lesley's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were about 40,000 new seizures reported.
In their overwhelming majority, the new fractures were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost disappeared, as said leaders of the Chinese health sector at a convention in the province of Yunan.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LOAT community in China.
Homophilia was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LOAT community remains common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxin Waters lies that a man has leaked data from Republican senators, condemns the "dangerous lies" and the "consensual theories"
This Saturday, the U.S. Representative Maxin Wothers interrupted the allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information from three Republican senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic MP of Los Angeles has argued that the allegations were promoted by commentators and websites of the "end of the right".
"False, lie and even more terrible lies," Waters reported on her statement on Twitter.
The published information shall include the address of the home and phone numbers of the mayors Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and of Mike Lee and Orin Hatt of Yota.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from the environment of Capitol Hill during the hearing of the committee of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Caveno.
The leak occurred some time after the three older men had questioned Caveno.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the reports was linked to the Waters office and published the data of a member of the Waters staff, reported The Hill.
"This unwarranted claim is a completely foolish and forthright lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these false and false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unwarranted claim is a completely foolish and forthright lie."
The Waters statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, including by the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleser.
"That breath is full of anger," Fleser wrote.
"This shows it doesn't have the strength to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He's not supposed to be brave.
He must not question the motives of the one who accuses him.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleser seemed to compare the Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavano, who was accused by his critics of being very angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a candidate for the Republicans who is trying to overthrow Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," tweeted.
In her statement, Waters reported that her office had notified "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these false allegations".
"We will do everything we can to find those responsible," he continued, "and to account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Review of the film Johnny English Backprints - a subtone spec film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to search for Brexit's signs in every new British film and this seems to apply in this live-up of the franchise of action-comodia films with hero Johnny English, which started in 2003 with the Johnny English film and returned in 2011 with the Johnny English film: The Return.
Can this humourous self-esteem about how bad we seem to be to become the new opportunity for the nation's exports?
In any case, the inquisitive Johnny English with its eyelids was able to renew his permission to do so for a second time. His name states that it is a wider comedian created designed for non-English cinematographic viewers.
This is, of course, the Azama secret agent who, while pretending to have the light and ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouseau, with a dose of "main bin" and something from the guy who played one and only south on the music theme of the movie The Fire Roads at the opening of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the traveling and international mystery man that Atkinson was once exposed to Barclaycard's most forgotten television advertisements, causing chaos in his passage.
There's one or two good times in this last movie of J.E.
I liked it when Johnny England approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the ellipticals hit his skull.
Atkinson shows his talent in the comedy, however, humour is quite subtonic and strange, especially when "serious" film franchises such as the 007 and Hazardous Shipping now contain enough comics.
humour seems to be addressed to children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's crazy rides are not as imaginative and related as the Atkinson's cartoons for Binson's character.
The eternal central issue is that Britain has a serious problem.
A government hacker has infiltrated the super secret Internet network of British spies, bringing to the fore the identity of all British agents on mission, to the great disappointment of the agent in service, which Kevin Eldon is being driven into a unfortunately small role for his future.
It is the last stage for a ambitious and ambitious prime minister who is in love with the collapse due to political intelligence: Emma Thompson is doing the best he can with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the scenario does not help her in particular.
Information advisers shall inform it that, since each active lens has been discovered, it should return someone unarmed.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a director at an aristocrat school, but gives unofficial lessons about secret agents: there are some nice scenes here, as English offers a mirror academy of the type A High Rock School.
English returns to Whitehall for urgent information and re-connects with Baff's former and sick partner, whom Ben Miller again suffers.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which Vicky Peperdin is not fully exploited.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the Bay for the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful and shared benefit of the Bouletova that Olga Kirilenko is subjected to.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being reproached for the charming billion-dollar technology that claims he can solve Britain's technological weaknesses: the threatening Jason Volta, whom Jake Lacey suffers.
English and Buff start the forest of their pascocomody: transformed as waiters, set fire to a soft French restaurant, cause chaos as they try to smuggle illegally into the luxury yacht of Volta, and English causes anarchy as they try to use an iconic reality device to get familiar with the interior of the Volta house.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as lovely and fascinating as it is, it continues to remember a little child television.
A few things.
And as with the other films, Johnny English, I ask myself: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he will really grow up with his talent?
Workers lie that they are considering a plan to work the British quarterly, but to be paid for Thursday
Jeremy Corbin's Working Party is going to consider a radical plan to work the British four days a week, but to be paid for five-day work.
The party, according to information, seeks to provide the company’s directors with the savings achieved through the restoration of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an additional day off.
Thus, workers will enjoy a three-day weekend, without any reduction in their wages.
Sources say that the idea coincides with the economic agenda and the party's plans in order to strike a balance in favour of the workers.
The change in a four-day week was approved by the Labour Societies Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A higher source than the Labour Party said in The Sunday Times: "A policy change is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen in one night, but the four-day work week is a ambition aimed at bringing the party closer to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as the overall strategy of the party for industry."
The Working Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party's policy and is not examined by the party."
The secretary of the shadow government, John McDonald, used the Labour Conference last week to develop his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonald said he was determined to regain power from "personal directors" and "profit-makers" in the public benefit companies.
The plans of the secretary of the shadow government also mean that today's shareholders in the irrigation companies may not take their full share back, as a potential Labour Government could carry out "trading" because of suspected disasters.
It also confirmed plans for the placement of employees in company boards and the creation of mutual participation capital, so that 10% of private-sector companies would be given to employees who would receive annual contributions of up to 500 sterlings.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking at the 60-minute show about whether the FBI's investigation into Kabano could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the service could affect some Republican elders to withdraw their support.
In his interview on Sunday, Scott Peley, responding to the 60-minute show, asked the Republican elders John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could be upset by anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, it does," Kennedy said.
"I said by going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him straight, "Did you do it?"
He was an ametheque, determined, categorical."
However, Graham's vote seems to be not going to change.
"I have decided on Brett Caveno and there will be an explosive class to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejected it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blazi Ford.
"And whoever's appointed can't confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and famous stars, but also an equally impressive mission: eradicating world poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are scheduled to meet at the Great Lawn of Central Park within the framework of the Global Citizens Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardie Be and Son Ments, but also to be sensitive to the real goal of the event, which is the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those who are actively fighting against it.
In order to ensure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as declaring volunteers, sending an email to a world leader, calling or finding other essential ways to contribute to their awareness of the goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of a reward with a free concert the right way to convince our citizens to take action or is it just another case of so-called "clicking" when some feel that they really make the difference by signing an electronic request or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen Group has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, promoting a number of different objectives.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of over $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the secured capital has so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the basic commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British investor and developer union, which has undertaken the commitment "to help children make full use of their capabilities", promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to eliminate subsidies, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of bribery a footnote in history," Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public during the London live concert in April 2018.
The group also stated that following 5,000 actions and calling on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, which addresses 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
Answering the question "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" which is included in the site's frequent questions,
a member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the great movements for human rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because we are united stronger.
Janet Jackson, Vincent, Sean Mendes, Cardy Bee and Janel Mona are some of the artists that will be shown at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Debora-Le Farnes and Hyu Jackman.
The US can use the Navy to "exclusion" by preventing Russia's energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington can turn "if necessary" into its Navy to prevent the availability of Russian energy in the markets, including the Middle East, as US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it operates following a call from the legal government, is a decision to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons why they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to address Russian activity.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, in order to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke was addressed to participants in the event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is described as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He agreed with Washington's approaches to addressing Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, a little bit too much, the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "pain that only knows a trick," as it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as the Trab administration has undertaken the task of strengthening exports of US liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper choice for European consumers.
For this reason, Trab's administration, including President Donald Trab himself, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trab, will make Berlin a "agreement" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that pipeline Nord Stream 2, a project with a budget of $11 billion, which is going to double the existing capacity of pipelines into 110 billion Cuban measures, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's firm resistance to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States led to the reaction of Germany, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's top industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kebfe, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously examine the possibility of applying for the presidency in 2020, says Massachusetts governor
The mayor of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that she would seriously consider declaring herself a candidate for the Presidency after the interim elections.
At a meeting in the capital of Holiok in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and correct our troubled government, and that is why a woman needs to be at the top," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will examine the possibility of a candidate for the Presidency."
Warren criticised President Donald Tramb during the meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trab does in our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't spell her words about Trab and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Caveno.
On a Friday tweet, Warren said that "of course it is necessary to investigate the FBI before the vote."
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not believe that they should vote for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said that the elderly should not apply, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% was in favour of such a candidate.
The review has shown more support for a possible candidate than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible candidate and 48% in favour.
Other popular names from the Republicans who have been discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidate are former vice-president Joe Baiden and Mayor Bernie Sanders of Bermuda.
Baiden said he'd decided officially by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sara Pilein referred to Track Pilein's Trauma Strain Disorder at Donald Tramb's concentration
Track Paulin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his campaign in September.
Arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"With what my son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families living with the effects of the Strait Disorder and the injuries that our soldiers carry when they return to their homeland," he told the public in the context of Donald Trab concentration in the Gulf of Oklahoma.
Pauline described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said about her son and other veterans that "they return slightly different, return harder, return harder, ask questions if there is respect for what soldiers, aircraft and any other member of the army have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, an intervention in reference to domestic violence and armed robbery while in a moody state, according to Dan Bennet, a representative of the police department of Vasila.
18 countries and the region of Colombia support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the region of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to provide asylum to victims who are trying to escape from alliances or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the region submitted a report on Friday's friend curiae in Washington, supporting an asylum-seeker to challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions' treatment submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August has not been discovered against federal policy.
He stated that her "and her violent sons who are members of society" abused her, however, US officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
He was held in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come, as countries dealing with intense problems with associations and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy thwarted the 2014 decision of the Committee on Migration (BIA) and allowed undeclared immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the Columbia Region, Carl Rasin, said on Friday that the new policy "misses all decades of civil, federal and international law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such a plea violates this principle," in the report friend curiae.
The lawyers also claimed that the policy of refusing entry to immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, claiming that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "have the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Seison ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," the session said in its statement on 11 June on politics.
The goal of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) people face every day throughout the world.
Unresolved rescue efforts in Palus, as the number of dead is doubled in spite of the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was constantly deteriorating.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Rizza Kusuma, trying to relieve her baby who had a fever, in a eviction center that had been set up in the devastated town of Palus.
"Every minute the hospitals bring other bodies.
The clean water is sprinkling."
Some residents have taken steps to return to their ruined homes and to collect through the water their existing ones, trying to fill what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged by the 7.5 earthquake of the Richter scale, were unable to cover the needs.
Some wounded, such as Dui Harris, who suffered a fracture of the middle and the shoulder, stayed outside the Palus Military Hospital, where the first aid was given to the ground due to the continuing strong movements.
Dakrya poured out his eyes as he was instructed how he felt the violent earthquake ravaged the room on the fifth floor of the hotel shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I was trapped in the cracks of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "fear" with "advertising ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a quarterly advertisement in a daily newspaper of the United States surpassing the mutual trade benefits between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trab reported last Wednesday on China Daily's on- payroll that appeared in the Des Moines Register, the newspaper with most sales in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Congress elections on 6 November, a category that China refuses.
Trab's claim that Beijing has been involved in American elections marked what US officials have reported on Reuters that it is a new phase of the escalating campaign that Washington has unleashed in order to exert pressure on China.
Although it is not prohibited for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating trade war and have imposed different import duties on each other.
China’s customs copyists at the beginning of the trade war aimed at affecting exporters in countries such as Iova, who supported the Trab Republican Party, reported Chinese and American experts.
Teri Brandt, US ambassador to China and former long-term governor in Iowa, a state that is an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Brandt wrote in an opinion article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is afraid of this kind by publishing propaganda advertisements on our free press".
"In an attempt to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the precious tradition of freedom of speech and the free press of America, publishing on a payment advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Brandand wrote.
"On the contrary, in the wake of Beijing, you will find minimal deviating voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's difficult economic path, since the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal which.
The Republicans host women voters in the interim elections because of the flag with Kavano, analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend the Supreme Court's application for Brett Caveno despite complaints of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, in the forthcoming interim elections.
The feelings on this issue are particularly intense, and most Republicans have stated that they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be restored," Grand River, professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Reier doubts that the move at the last moment of Senator Jeff Fleick (R-Arison) to request an investigation by the FBI will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, are not going to forget it tomorrow, and are certainly not going to forget it in November," said Karen Jean-Pierer, senior consultant and national press representative of the MoveOn Progress Group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators regularly called the slogan "November is coming!" on the run of the Senate, as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission gave the green light for Kabano's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazi Ford, mentioned Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach record level," said Stu Rodenberg, an uncompromising political analyst at the news website.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of undecided women voters in the fore and younger voters, aged 18 to 29 years who, while opposed by the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which he described in detail her complaints of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, the analysts had predicted that there could be a reaction if the Republicans went ahead with the money.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote in committee or the final vote or whether Kavano will be put out. It also has to do with how the Republicans handled the issue and how it was dealt with," Gai Cesil, director of the Priorities USA team who helps in the election of the Republicans, said on a news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat disillusioned for whom to believe after the depositions of Fort and Caven, slightly more in favour of the second.
A new overview of YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were sure or probably believed in Ford's deposition, while 35% said that he was sure or probably believed in Kavano.
In addition, 38% said he thought Kavano was probably lying about his deposition, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Fleick's move, the FBI began investigating Ford's complaints and at least another complainant, Debora Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an oath before the Judicial Committee of the Senate that Kavano was attacked while he was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her organs while they were at a party, when both were studying in the Gale in the 1980s.
The World News Explorer plans to start a new Web to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Bernards Lee, the inventor of the World East, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new penalty for this legend of technology is Inrupt, a company based on the open Berners Lee Solids platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, and who can have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Bernards Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is the "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology by allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage space" or an POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of outstanding works, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify to be all available in a browser program and all these at the same time.
The only characteristic of the personal data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this option "personal strengthening through the data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to provide resources, procedures and appropriate skills for the Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company consists of Bernards Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some involved programmers working on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Bernards Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether they were allowed to make radical changes, reversing business models in one night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication on the Medium that circulated on Saturday, Bernards Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of the Solid platform".
In 1994, Bernards Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Bernards Lee has had a strong voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with Inrupt, Bernards Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next time on the Internet," Bernards Lee added.
Bernard Van: Honorary tax on heir who received the Victorian Stock Exchange in World War A
The only heir of the Anglican Church who has received the Stairs of Victoria during the A'World War as a soldier was honored in the homeland 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a free spy four days later and never learned that he had spread the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday, the discovery of a memorial plaque was made by his two grandchildren, who were accompanied by a visit to Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "exceedingly symbolic" that the plaque's discoveries were made just 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the metal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vice-Chairman Van led his squad into the St. Ken Canal through a very dense cloud and was taking strong fires from weapons of battle and gunpowder."
Later, he stepped on the front line and with "excellent manhood" he led the line forward before hitting himself with a weapon of battle three out of the split.
Colonel Van was killed by a German free spy on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never get there, it's something that makes you feel unlimited respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid down a ceiling after his departure, led by the Philharmonic of New Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he "felt great appreciation for the presence" and added that "the manhood of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he has from many people."
MMA's fans stayed to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa in Uruguay
Consider the following scenario: you have stayed to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but you are thrilled to see this unique sporting event.
The program in San José included 13 matches, including six in the main card, and would live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, to the night zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to go out in the ring, the viewers in the United Kingdom remained sympathetic when the show changed Peppa Gurunaki.
Some did not like it at all, as they had stayed awake until the first hours of the morning especially for the fight.
A Twitter fan described the children's program as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so the children's programme had to be disrupted," said Dave Svarts, senior marketing deputy and Bellator's communication when asked for transmission.
"Peppa the Gurunaki, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Koker, said they are going to process the programme in order to include UK observers in the future.
"If we think about the reefs, I think we can make it," Koker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there and we won't be able to do it until our own Sunday, i.e. their own Monday.
But we're trying.
Trust me, when the change happened, a lot of messages were exchanged back and forth, and it wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you that next time something like this is not going to happen.
We'll limit it to five matches rather than six, as we usually do.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" because of his sexuality
The Olympics in the afterlife, Tom Daley, said that he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, however, it moved him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until high school that "they're not all like me."
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Lavern on Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that since he became a parent, he had less interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Yang, a regular presenter for the famous radio broadcast, was on leave for several months due to illness.
As invited to Lavern's first show, Dale said she felt "inadequate" compared to others when she grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and desire to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The Olymponian Galcine twice is an advocate of the rights of the LOATKI community and has been exploited to participate in the annual Community Competitions in Australia to call for more countries to move towards decriminalisation of homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without impact, and that he wanted to give in to other "hope".
The three times a world champion said it was "surprising" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley got married last night to Oscar Dustin Lance Black, who is 20 years older than him, but he argued that the age difference was never a matter.
"When you go through so much at such a small age" (it was the first time in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find someone who has similar good and bad moments."
The couple adopted a son of June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said he changed his whole perspective.
"If you asked me last night, all I wanted was to win the gold," he said.
"But there are more important things than gold Olympic metals.
My gold Olympic metal is Robby.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from cancer to brain.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had taken tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you wouldn't be near us to sit in the first row," he said.
"I kept his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the metal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life, fighting in the matches at the Olympic Games in my country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of the first song, Heather Small's Proud, which froze him in his preparation for the Olympic Games and still causes him to be discouraged.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The off-form Michelson will sit on the ice on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Michelson will score a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Michelson, who participates for the 12th time (record number) in the games organised every two years, was forced by Chief Jim Furick to sit in the pool for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as usual for the United States, the winner five times shared the day to cheer up the lines and "work" his game hoping to fix his trouble points.
Without ever having the most direct driver even at the bottom of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for the narrow field of Le Golf National, where the distant ones are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the field had not reached, Michelson, in the ninth match of Sunday, faces Francesco Molinari, the British Open winner, who is working with leading Tommy Flywood to win their four matches this week.
If Americans, who were four degrees below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Michelson's game may be crucial.
Furick expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he's playing today, hit me friendlyly on his back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has great self-esteem.
His name is in Hall of Fame and has offered too much in these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but we ended up there and we thought we should go.
He wants to get out there, just like everyone else."
Michelson's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record for most of the cyractic games at Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that didn't reach the height of his personal record.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 grand and seven half, even though Furick said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make jokes and he's excellent in the group room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun bothering him this week.
His contribution is not just in the game."
The leader of the European team, Thomas Byrne, knows that the big drive can soon be lost
Thomas Byron, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great drive from the singles of the last day to Ryder Cup can easily be turned into a draw.
Danos made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros succeeded in winning five degrees against the Americans, but just managed to cross the finish line with different breasts, winning 141⁄2-131.2.
"Remember yourself all the time that we had a big show in Valderrama, we had a big show in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just after violence," said Beorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 generation to win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 to Le Golf National.
So the story will show to me and to all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're going to get ready tomorrow to give it all.
We'll get out there and play right.
Nothing's finished until you see the grades on the table.
We have a goal, to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players in our group, but we know very well that the other group also has good players – the best in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of its players in a difficult golf course, Byron adds: "I wouldn't hesitate to predict the result.
Tomorrow's another animal.
Tomorrow's individual performance is measured, and that's something different.
It's great to be in the field with a customer when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then you're trying your full skills as a golfer.
This is the message you have to deliver to players, how to get the best of themselves tomorrow.
You leave behind your partner and he must give them all and show them to the best of himself."
Unlike Byron, Jim Furick from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than those they had with their players, except for Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas, who won three degrees from the four.
Forrick himself has lived both ends of the revolutions of the last day, as he belonged to the winning team in Brooklyn before the unexpected coup, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every row of his word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenso, chief in 1999, had choked his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When we get this serum, there's a lot of pressure in the middle fights.
We decide our turn accordingly and we play with the turn we're going to try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has taken the lead in the match and is dealing with Rory McCillroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flywood and Ian Paulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the series.
"I went with this group with this series because I think it's covering the whole way," Byron said, justifying his choices for the singles.
New Deployment for the new warship of Germany
The new flag of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but will not be received until at least next year, due to faulty systems and costly costs, the local media report.
The position in service of Rhineland-Palatinate, the commander of Baden-Württemberg, has been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Maritime War in 2014, but the problems with tradition were crucial for the success of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen class aircraft.
They will bring a strong rule, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and ship-to-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, superconductors and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as the use of new aircraft will be possible for up to two years apart from German ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that even if warships are considered the last technology, which will allow Germany to show its power abroad, until they are finally put into service, they will already be over, says Die Zeit.
The F125 crash was launched last night, when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a ship after delivery.
There has not been much information on the reasons for the return, but the German media reported a number of significant "complexities with software and material" that would have put the warship into use if used in a battle mission.
The problems of the software were particularly important. as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, just half compared to the oldest Bremen class brakes.
It was also discovered that the ship has a much higher weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz fleet is believed to have the double weight of similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the whole project (including the training of the crew) was also a matter.
It is said that it reached the EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the initial budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the new air carriers are particularly important because the maritime force of Germany is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Military Navy "will not have a ship for missions in the near future".
The officer stated that the problem had been resolved over time, because the old ships had been disarmed, but there were no other ships to replace them.
It was claimed that none of the Baden-Württemberg class fans could join the Navy.
The National Trust hides the secret life of the nightbirds
A new research carried out in a village in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to discover how nightbirds use the landscape when they hunt their food.
The conclusions will shed new light on the behaviour of these only-ridden women and will contribute to the design of future actions for the protection of the environment.
The study by scientists of the National Trust on Scotland will explore the habits of the common nano-night and micro-night, as well as the coffee autumn and Dobden's muscle in the Inverewe Gardens gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the countryside to monitor nighttime activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile research using sensors.
The analysis of the sound of all sound recordings by experts will determine the frequency of nighttime calls and what types of behaviour this behaviour is.
Then there will be a map of the habitat and a report to form a detailed picture of their behaviour on a local scale.
Rob Dewar, an environmental adviser to the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are more important for the nightlife and how they are used by all kinds of species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of management of habitats, such as the creation of habitats and the best way to maintain forests for night-time and other related species.
The nocturnal populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly since the last century.
They are driven by the construction and development projects that affect the parts where they rot and destroy their habitats.
Respiratory and lighting are also dangerous, as are collapsing films for mice and some chemical processes of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Nights are not really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their fear.
They use an advanced audio detection technique to detect atoms and obstacles in their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, considers the nightmares very important.
He has ten trained experts, who conduct regular research, inspect the parts where the night skyscrapers and sometimes rescue them.
The organisation has also created Scotland's first and only refuge exclusively for nightbirds in the county of Thrave, in Damphris and Galouy, where eight of the ten species of Scottish nightbirds live.
The land manager, David Thompson, says that the land is the ideal ground for the nightmares.
"Here at Thrave we have an excellent nightlife area," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of big trees and an ideal habitat.
There are still many that we do not know about the nightmares, so the work we do here but otherwise will help us to understand better what is needed to increase their populations."
It notes that it is important to first check the existence of nightmares before any housekeeping work, as the destruction of one and only small-scale follicles could kill up to 400 women and small ones, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
The nightmares are protected species and we are forbidden to kill them, disturb them or disturb their peace, or destroy their dens.
Elizabeth Ferel, a staff member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer help.
He said, "There's a lot left to learn about our nightmares and about many of our species just don't know the evolution of their population."
Ronaldo rejects complaints of rape, as his lawyers are preparing to report a German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo described complaints of rape against him as "fake news", saying that some "want to be self-proclaimed" exploiting his name.
His lawyers are about to announce the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the complaints.
The attacker of Portugal and Juvendus is accused of raping an American named Catherine Magorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, she was brought to pay $375,000 to buy her silence and not to mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live video at Instagram at 142 million fans after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time winner of Gold Balls in the camera.
"They want to get ahead of themselves and exploit my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to report Der Spiegel on the allegations he has published, which they have described as "an unacceptable reference to private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Skertz said the player would seek compensation for "ethical damage in proportion to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of private life in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After their acquaintance at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player’s room, where he was brought to rape by nature according to documents filed with the Regional Court of the Clark County of Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronalto fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy", but handed him the other "one percent".
The papers say Ronaldo admits that they had sexual contact, but that it was consensual.
Magorga also claims to have gone to the police and to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because "he feared the possibility of opponents" and was concerned about her "public reconciliation".
The 34-year-old says she's trying to reverse the settlement, as she's still suffering from a trans-traumatic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was willing to receive a transfer to Royal Madrid from Manchester Youth in the time of alleged abuse, and this summer he moved to the Italian Juvendes to secure an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will regret forever" the loss of automotive industries
The United Kingdom "will regret forever", if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automotive industry said that the impact of cross-border delays in Brexit would cost jobs without an agreement.
The factory in Bernston, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis models are being manufactured, supplied almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will cease," said Marvin Kuk, Toyota's CEO at Bernaston.
Other automotive industries in the United Kingdom have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has stated that it will close Mini's factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern risks to the supply chain according to the automotive industries in the Brexit case without agreement.
Toyota's production line follows the fair-in-time. Exchanges arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the borders, resulting in delays and lack of independence according to the industry.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to keep a stock outside one day at her factory in Derbysair, the company reported, so the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is working specifically to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement, we want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to exploit this opportunity," said Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The data that come not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is necessary to ensure the continuity of supply chains".
Toyota was not in a position to say how bad it would stop production, however, warned that in the long term the additional cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Chuvalaris, who has been working in Bernston for 24 years and is the union manager at the factory, said that the members of the company are increasingly concerned: "My experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
A government representative said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trab's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, White House announces.
The important meeting of Donald Trab with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can "fight another week", as the dispute for the candidate continues at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Rapporteur Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian intervention in the elections, the Trab's assistance links with Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Trab may fire the Deputy Attorney General, endangering Miller's independence, and feeding Washington's troops for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a chair in order to record his talks with Trab and allow the President to be removed from office on the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, last Monday he moved to the White House through reports that he was going to resign.
On the contrary, a meeting with Trab was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trab said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order to disagree with the hearing before the Senate's Committee on Judicial Affairs, in which both Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trab ordered the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kabano, thus delaying the holding of a vote more than the plenary.
Sarah Sanders, a representative of Trab's type, appeared on Fox News Sunday TV.
I was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "A date has not yet been set, perhaps this week, but perhaps another data week of all other cases involving the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I still like to always inform the guy."
Some journalists have responded to this claim: Sanders has had to update a type in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of information was not due to the "printing" movements of television journalists, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are shown."
Then he let it mean that there will be increased or direct communication between the Trab and the guy.
"The President gives more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without adding any evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
There will still be updates, said Sanders, but "if the guy has the opportunity to address questions directly to the President of the United States, that is even better than talking to me.
We try to apply it often and you've seen that we've been applying it often in the last few weeks and it'll take the place of the type information where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trab often accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or interviews with official visitors.
Individual type interviews are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is happening, with an anti-conventional and sometimes foreign appearance in front of assembled journalists.
Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health System through fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens working in the National Health System of Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and to wish them to stay even after leaving the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Jean Freeman, Scotland's MP, sent a letter, leaving less than six months for the United Kingdom to leave the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed to cover the costs of application for a "setted status" for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Ms. Freman wrote in her letter: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on departure continued and led to expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario of non-agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every official in terms of nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we want you to stay here."
Kristion Abercrobie undergoes an emergency surgery following head injury
The defender of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrobi, was subjected to an urgent surgery following an injury to the head in the Saturday fight, where the Tennessee State Tigers were shot 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by the journalist in the Tennessee newspaper, Mike Orggan.
The main coach of Tennessee State Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-year.
"He came to the pond and just broke up there," said Reed.
The nurses and medical personnel gave Abercrobi oxygen to the pond and then put it in a trunk and moved it back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State star told Chris Harris from the WSMV TV station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrobi was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no "data on the type/extension of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrobi, a second-year student with limited participation status ("redshirt"), distributes his first season to Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He did five total pitches on Saturday before leaving the game, thus reaching the 18 total pitches for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with the highest price of the real estate market in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher price on the real estate market in the United Kingdom, while the additional amounts will be used to assist the homeless, in line with the new Torris plans.
The measure will undermine the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the end of the paper will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to provide assistance to host
Foreign buyers will be forced to pay a higher price on the real estate market in the United Kingdom, while the additional amounts will be used to assist the tenants, as Tereza May will be announced today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to undermine the success of the Jeremy Corbin campaign to attract young voters with promises of more economic housing and to target high wages.
The increase in the end of the paper will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional amounts will strengthen the government's campaign to combat the lack of housing.
The increase imposed at the current end of the paper, together with the highest tax rates imported two years ago for the purchase of second-houses and rented-houses, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to yield up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, leading to price increases and making it more difficult for first-house buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become cities-families because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy is introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the end of the paper, so that more young people can get their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of the real estate high, gaining land without, however, using it and calling on Mrs. May to destroy the floor in economic dwellings in order to restore Britain's "solvent desire".
Mr Corbin announced an impressive series of proposed loose reforms, including rental controls and banning "no need for" exports.
He also wants to give greater powers to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "I said that I would devote my prime minister to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
This means repairing the dissolved real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies based abroad to buy at home as easily as hard workers British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of housing ownership has become too far away and the lack of housing is still sustainable."
Jack Ross: "My absolute ambition is to train Scotland's team."
The head of Santerland, Jack Ross, states that his "absolute ambition" is at some point to become a coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotchez is thrilled with the challenge of setting up the team of northeastern England, which is now in third position in the English Football Category (League One), three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Light Stadium in summer, after previously returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Championship the previous competitive season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team, and that's what Ross said on Scotland's BBC radio station Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland's team in Hamden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something he always brought me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed in training groups."
Among the leaders of Ross in Santerland is Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gas Poyet and Paolo Dee Canio.
Aloe Athletic's former coach reported that he did not feel a debt when he was called to take such established names to such a large group, having previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Taun's approaches.
"At this point, success for me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question "Can I return this group to Primer Lig?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this group, it certainly belongs to Primer Lig," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I'll probably find myself successful here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross started his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period as a assistant coach in Dabarton and a period of 15 months in the training staff of Harts.
He then helped Aloe to return from submission to the third category and led St. Mirren from the lips of submission to the acquisition of the Championship next season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlpool, Folkerk, St. Myren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroad," he said, recalling taking over the position of coach Aloe.
"I really thought I was more interested in being a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, making decent money out of it, and I got pretty high.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to put up with a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having trouble with the stress and the pressure on my job, but my coach's job is perfectly suited.
I always wanted to train, and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I felt with myself all my adult life."

The best time for beer is 5.30mm on Saturdays, according to research
The hot fuel boosted the profits for the testing pubs in Britain but brought more pressure to the chains of restaurants.
The pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of the restaurants were reduced by 4.8 per cent, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from CGA's advisory company, which collected the data, said: "The continued sun exposure and the largest expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern with the previous month, June, where the profits of the pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant revenues in June simply deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars serving alcohol went far better, with the corresponding figures of the previous years having risen more than the corresponding figures in the restaurants.
The pubs serving food also underwent sunny days, although not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
In all the managed pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sales of food decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM's entertainment and hospitality analysis department, said: "These results verify the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of the major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors with regard to sales on the outside market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to be difficult, but the fall in sales by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis will be particularly painful data from ongoing cost pressures.
The long, warm summer could not have appeared at a worse time for entrepreneurs in the centre and the time would indicate whether the lowest temperatures we experienced in August would give a long-term extension."
The overall increase in sales to pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in sales launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales indicator for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyzes efficiency data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of more than 9 million pounds and is the established reference point for the industry.
One of the five children keeps secret accounts on social media, hidden from their parents
As research reveals, one in five children - even 11 years of age - keep secret accounts in social media, hidden from their parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta in Instagram
This news raised fears that sexual content might be involved.
Twenty percent of students said they have a master account to show their parents
One of the five children - even 11 years of age - create accounts in the social media, which they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts - this is a reference to Instagram photo reporting website.
This news raised the fear that it belongs to sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they maintain a healthy "main" account to show their parents while keeping private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who allowed others to rape her ("hire me").
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the School Directors and Directors’ Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Bukanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and their teachers cannot identify them."
Elind Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish station council
Elind Doyle was elected as a non-executive adviser to the Scottish Station Council at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning sports star and President Ian Beaty has commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who are running the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience in the last decade.
"Eilid enjoys unrelenting respect throughout the Scottish, British and global stable community and we are sure that the stable in Scotland will have a huge benefit from its entry to the council," Bity said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in the Atlante Olympic Games in 1996, has won a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular commentator on BBC, remained paralyzed after a transient ischaemic angina brain accident.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I got brainwashed.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will show whether or not I'm going to recover.
It was exhausting, but I got completely sick, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing some exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Female advertising comparing mothers to cows spreads the online public opinion
A women's production company has lost its online public opinion with an ad comparing mothers who are pregnant with cows who are pregnant.
In order to launch the so-called "worldly first silent and portable telesaster", the consumer technology company Elvie circulated a humorous advertisement inspired by video clip to show the freedom offered to pregnant mothers by the new telesaster.
Four real mothers dance in a herd of cows full of ash, with a song that includes tracks such as: "Yes, I fit myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you didn't notice, these aren't masts, they're my breasts."
The song goes on: "Crowd it up, grow it up, feed the baby, grow it up, grow it up, make it up to my ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the Facebook page, has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it does not take the "frequent" of the milk industry seriously.
"A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to stay pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their babies steal it a few days after birth," someone commented.
Elvie's theatre is discreetly housed in a nursing home (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a mother's theatre that can hold their babies?"
Someone else added, "An advertisement totally out of reality."
Others defended advertising, while a woman admitted that her song seemed "cardiastic".
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy a store like this if I was still stocking.
The boost made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I didn't sit over it.
It's a clever product." Someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who pump their mother's milk (often in their workplace or in their toilets) and feel like "bees".
It is not an advertising that incriminates or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that everyone danced with the discriminating theaters in their backyards.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast milk with a teapot say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Theatre, however, is completely silent, does not have cables or tubes and has discriminating inside a bra, allowing women to move, keep their babies and even go out during the landing.
Anna Balarin, partner and Executive Director of Creation at Mother, commented: "Elvie's theatre is such a revolutionary product that it was worth a bold and challenging launch.
By making a comparison between the pregnant women and the dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the breeding of mother milk and all the challenges it has, at the same time showing in a fun and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tent will bring.
It's not the first time Elvie has become a front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the pasarela for the fashion design Marta Jakobovski while using the product.
Hundreds of children of immigrants moved silently to a camp at the Texas border
The number of children in detention of immigrants has risen, although the monthly border visits remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trab administration have made it more difficult to match children with conservatives.
Traditionally, most conservatives are also the same immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to come forward and ask for a child and thus endanger their ability to stay in the country.
The risk was compounded in June, when the federal authorities announced that powerful conservators and other adult members of their household should give fingerprints and that the data would be notified to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, told Congress that the service had arrested dozens of people who were asked to maintain unaccompanied minors.
Later, the department confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had a white criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either conservatives or members of the housekeepers are illegal in the country and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to seek these people," said Mr Albens.
In order to speed up the handling of children's cases, the responsible authorities introduced new rules that some of these children should appear before a court within one month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as previously established, according to refugees.
Many will appear through an icon-televised conference, instead of a self-representation, in order to develop their claims for the granting of a legal regime before the competent court on immigration matters.
Those who believe that they do not meet the conditions for exemption will be released immediately.
The more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent explosions or attempts to dismay, according to refugees and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
The speakers said that these concerns are increasing in larger facilities such as Tornigo, where indications that a child is having difficulty are more likely to become unintelligible because of the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the theater without giving enough time to prepare the children psychologically or to say good - bye to their friends can exacerbate the injury they are already fighting.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "capitulation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mulam also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and "will receive appropriate treatment."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said at the assembly.
Mualem argued that "the war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions more have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "give this sacred battle until we persecute all the Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and informing both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Basar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground of the war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good for their return and accused "certain western countries" of "dispersing unreasonable fears" that led refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Policy a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be granted for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assand and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a destabilized zone in the last major premier of the rebels in Indlib created an opportunity to promote political debates.
The Russian agreement has prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Muhammad, however, pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target giants, including fighters from the Al-Qaida-front-Nushra connection, who "will be defeated".
UN Special Envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Mualem put the conditions for the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interventions should be made.
Because Trab will win a second term
With this logic, Mr Trab will win the 2020 elections again, unless, as many liberals may hope, the proposal for a bribe and scandals put an end to his presidency in advance.
Something that would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic finale of the presidency of all times!"
So far, there is no evidence of abstinence from the viewers.
Since 2014, television numbers in the high television area have been overdoubled, reaching 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million in MSNBC.
The Fox News television network has an average of 2.4 million TVs in the high television area, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" has saved TV numbers on satellite television, with 3.5 million TVs in the evenings of important news.
It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Bear, producer of the ABC's drama series "Designated Survival" where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capital.
Nell Scowell, a veteran screenwriter and author of the book entitled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
Remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trab.
He asked "Why?"
"You answered "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scowell said.
You can have fun even with chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens to television sets, scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy versus Wade case, if immigrant families can also reunite the health of the world economy.
The change of frequency is a luxury that only the most privileged TVs can enjoy.
And yet, you surpass the definition of the informed citizen when you are six hours away from watching a group of experts discuss the use of "multiple interviews at the scene" by Bob Woodworth for the book "Fear", Paul Manaford's bomber jacket of $15,000 worth of strawberry skin ("a clothes full of matter," according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the glamorous descriptions that Stormy Daniels made regarding Mr. Tramb's atomism.
However, I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What he does and what gives you the sense of reality show is he gives you something every night," said Brenda Montgomeri, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars TV program, about the constantly changing actors and the day-to-day reversals in Trab's show (starts fighting with N.F.L., he blames Kim Young One).
You don't have the luxury of losing any incident, otherwise you stay back.
When I met Mr. Flais this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius out of his house on the north coast of Kaya, but he was locked inside looking at MSNBC looking at the CNN.
He could not stand, not when Brett Kavano was about to appear before the Judicial Committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court was suspended by a branch.
"I remember doing those crazy shows back then, and the people said, "This will mean the beginning of the end of Western culture," Mr. Flies told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right at last."

External money is entering the most marginalization for the intermediate elections
It is no wonder that the 17th electoral region of Pennsylvania in Congress accepts a flow of money, thanks to the reintroduction of the electoral regions of Congress, which has put two members of Congress in action for the same position.
This recently redesigned suburban region of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamp, who was elected to another region in special elections held last spring.
Lamb has another active representative, the Republican Keith Rothphos, who represents the former 12th electoral region of Pennsylvania, which is largely coincident with the new 17th electoral region.
The maps were redesigned following a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old regions were dealt with in an anti-constitutional manner for the benefit of the Republicans.
The electoral renumbering in the new 17th electoral region led to a financial competition campaign between the major financial departments of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republical Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a final victory at a special electoral census held in March, for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania in Congress, which was attended by many people.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trab won the region by 20 degrees.
The political analysts give a slight advance to the Democrats.
The United States has examined the possibility of punishing El Salvador for its support in China, but they have turned back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trab had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and maintained a hotel in Panama until the partners sent the management team of the Trab Agency.
State Department officials have decided to revoke the US diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Newert, a representative of the service type earlier this month.
However, the imposition of sanctions was examined only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received around US$ 140 million as US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in economic aid and targeted restrictions on passports, would be painful for the Central American country, with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings developed, officials from North and Central America set up a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being, as a result of a corresponding concentration that took place last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the transition of refugees to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior executives made it clear that they wanted to proceed to the conference, giving a substantial end to the idea of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens is going to address the conference, which has now been scheduled for the mid-October, as an indication of the great importance the meeting has for administration, as the diplomats said.
And the three Americans returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in silence, without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultations, subject to anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the terms of the anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be the report by the Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the abuse of justice by Mr Trab, for which very strong evidence has now been published.
It is announced that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into the possible interaction between Mr Trab's pre-election campaign and Russia with regard to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr Trab will find an account before this body, as he is preparing to re-claim the presidency in the next elections and perhaps finally before the jury.
The 'if' is a lot and I do not suspect that Mr Trab's fall, nor his pledges in Europe, is inevitable.
There are options that must be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the course of this fight.
In 1938 German officials were ready to take action against Hitler, if his West had opposed and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The flow of history is turned around by such bending points and the steady course of democracy is accelerated or accelerated.
The Americans are coming against me now enough of these bending points.
What will we do if Mr. Trab fires the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was written in that newspaper that last night he proposed that the president be recorded secretly and that he was considered inappropriate for the president's position.
Mr Rosenstein said the adoption by the Times was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the recently requested F.B.I. investigation into Brett Caveno is not complete or fair or if it is appointed to the Supreme Court despite the basic charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim elections a Congress that will put Mr. Trab on account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I got at the Realm, I don't think we're going to fail.
My mother was Czechoslovaka Jewish who was transferred to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime she once held in my embassy home.
He survived, moved to America, and 60 years later he sent me to set up a Jewish Sabbath candle on that table with the bastika.

Graham Dorans of the Rangers is eager to fight Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equation in Spain with the Viareal earlier this month, will give her a lot of chances of proviso by the 7th Group of Europe League.
A knee injury has prevented Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until the match with the 2-2 level with the Victoriareal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a lever for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Vigiral is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We went to the game believing that we could do something and get out of here.
We may be able to escape at the end, but, in general, equality was a more just result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were a better group in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another great European night.
Well with things, we can take three degrees, but it will be a difficult game because they have brought good results in their last game, but with the world in play, I am sure that we can put our strengths and bring a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, because of my injuries and the changes made to the group itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, training is good.
Let us hope that we can do our best now, leave behind the last season and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of their fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few discussed it with their family.
Nearly half of the nationwide survey participants said they were discussing with their husbands the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about this in their children.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to hold the debate," said Holly Sneider, vice president of the Nationwide Life Security Company.
Start with that.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will be cared for, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial advice: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance at a purchase price to help you cover these costs or self-security with your own property - enough to have the money.
Draw up your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make sure that healthcare professionals comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also, you collect the possibility of making a full account for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your part and make sure that your accounts are paid, if you become untraught.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Please mention these details in a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just the economics, but who are the doctors?" Martin was asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Take care to prepare this plan."
A man accepted multiple guns with a gun aircraft in Ilfracob
One man accepted multiple guns with a gun as he was walking to his house last night.
The victim, about 40 years of age, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracob in the county of Devon, when he was shot in the chest, chest and arm.
The police described the event, which took place at 02:30 British Star Time, as a "random event".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries he suffered are not life threatening, and the police call for witnesses.
Associations and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palus on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With the communications to be interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have failed to obtain information from Dongala, a region in the north of Palus, which is closer to the centre of the 7.5-degree crisis of the Richter scale.
In Palus, more than 16,000 people were removed after the destruction.
The following are some important data on Palus and Dongala, on the island of Sulawezi:
Palus is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an anti-kingdom extending over 300 kilometres (180 miles) of coastline to the southwest of the island of Sulawezi.
The anti-government, a degree of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture constitute the main support for the economy of the province of central Sulawesi and, in particular, in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it meets more in Morouali, on the coast of Sulawezi.
Palou and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Disaster Management Service of Indonesia.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Chunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in the Seismic Finger of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most recent earthquakes and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indian coast in northern Somalia on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, while over half of them were in Auschwitz.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of May and early April.
Hundreds of dead in the island of Nyas, near the coasts of Sumara.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck the southern part of Javas, the most popular island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Seismic 7.6 degrees of Richter scale with focus close to the town of Pandang, capital of the province of West Sumara.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the Isles of Mentaui, near Sumara, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and cost some 300 people their lives.
2016: A low-density earthquake struck the Pindi Jaya region in Auschwitz, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the disaster that triggered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
It wasn't a tsunami this time, but over 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Great earthquakes struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Payline's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Pilein, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and candidate for Vice-President Sara Pilein was arrested for assault.
29-year-old Paulin, from Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, an obstacle to domestic violence and opposition to the principle, according to the report published on Saturday by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a well-known woman tried to call the police to complain about the crimes she was being committed, she grabbed the phone from her hands.
Pailin is temporarily held at the Mat-Su temporary reservation store, with a guarantee of $500, as mentioned at the KTUU television station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "surely, innocent" when asked, as the network reports.
Pauline faces charges for three category A outbreaks, which means he may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and a financial penalty of $250,000.
It is also charged for category A flood, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time he's been prosecuted against Pauline.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paulin.
His mother, Sarah Payline, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, accusations of domestic violence, complaints of criminal offences of domestic violence and possession of weapons were brought against him, while he was in a state of riot.
His companion claimed to have stabbed her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by veterinary groups in 2016 when she associated her son’s violent behavior with a trans-traumatic anxiety disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Seismic and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people lost their lives after a earthquake hit the island of Sulawezi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 degree earthquake on the Richter scale caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been cut off, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake hit central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social media, videos have been broadcast since the disaster.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a party on the beach in the city of Palus when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are asking for a very severe death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the imposition of a death penalty on Saiful Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack on New York that cost eight people their lives - a rare punishment imposed on the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is brought to use a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan, dragging passengers and bicycles found on his way on October 31st.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors should prove that Saipoff killed the eight victims "with intent" and caused serious bodily harm "with intent", according to the death penalty declaration lodged at the Court of Justice of the South York Region.
Both of these categories are subject to the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Saipov to face with the 22-point category, which included eight counts for murder against a criminal organisation, a regular practice often applied by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime and a category for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and study," the prosecutors said, describing the way in which Saipoff ended the attack as "apostate, hard and useless."
"The Saifulo Hambibulaevic Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to Diego's families and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Loir Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferouche, Ernan Diego Mentosa and Alekhandro Damian Panuko", as mentioned in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been decades since the last time the Court of Justice of the South Region of New York held a prosecution for a case involving the death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually subjected to an equal treatment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was imposed for a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the wives of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being sentenced to a conspiracy to perform a funeral for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The two Rosenbergs were performed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, was found to be irrevocable in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
He told the interrogators that he felt satisfied with his work, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to complete the attack by an ISIS video that he saw on his cell phone, according to the category.
He also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to the police.
He made a statement of innocence for the 22 categories listed in the category.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipov, said they are "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to impose a death penalty rather than the acceptance of the declaration of consent for sophistication with no likelihood of detention will simply extend the injury caused by the events for all concerned," Paton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty.
Mr Toris said that NAITZEL FARATZ should be the head of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Faraz vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during the protest assembly at the Toris Conference.
The former head of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians had to "feel pressure" from Eurospectors, as one of Teresa May's MPs said he should be the head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bowne told the protesters in Bermigham that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" so far if Mr Farage was the responsible minister for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May is facing in her attempt to reconcile her deeply lost Members was underlined by the fact that supporters of the EU stay in Toris participated in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the Chekers compromise plan under control through attacks by Brexit defenders, EU and EU-dwelling defenders.
The Allies continued to move forward with their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and to force Euro-Specists and Workers to choose between its package and the "haos".
Mr. Bowen said to the assembly of the Leave Means Leave (Design means Departure) in Solihal that he wanted to fly the "Chekers Plan".
He said that he should have been given a title of kindness to Mr Faraz and that he should have been given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we would have left now," he said.
Wellingboro MP added, "I will support Brexit, but we have to fly the Checkers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Boone rejected the allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The suggestion that the British people have changed their opinion and wishes to stay is completely absurd."
Brexit's pro-vote member of the Toris Andrea Jenkins was also in the protest and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checkers plan does not accept the broad public, the Opposition is not going to vote on it, it does not accept our party and our activists coming down the streets and below us elected.
Please leave the Chekers plan and start listening."
With a strong message to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraz said at the protest meeting that politicians should be forced to "feel pressure" if they are going to betray the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of confidence between us - the people - and the order of our policies," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you save her if you do that."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, feel pressure.
"We move the people's army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the EU's live-in champions showed in Burma before holding a regular concentration in the city centre.
A few activists were praising the Toris against Brexit after the group gathered this Saturday.
The Labour MP Lord Adonis locked the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with an application by the party at the start of the meeting.
"It is the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technology needed for the EU-type agreement – Canada with wealth, for the unspoilt border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
It doesn't mean good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take seriously the possibility of applying for the presidency
American midwife Elizabeth Warren says she will take seriously the possibility of applying for the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the deputy of the Republicans from Massachusetts spoke about its future plans during the concentration in a municipality of western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Tramb, protests her re-election in November, with opposition from the Republican representative of Jeff Dill, who co-chaired the Tram campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly believed that it can be measured by Trab in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event was her 36th meeting with voters using the structures of the municipality since the start of Trab's term.
One present at the meeting asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "to go to Washington women to build our dissolved government, which means that a woman must be found at the top."
Arrest for the deadly shooting of LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rose of Los Angeles announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect of the deadly shooting of LSU Wade Sims's death bomber on Friday.
Baton Rose's police department announced the arrest of Diton Simpson, 20 years old, at a type interview at 11mm (East Zone of Time).
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot fatally near the site of Southern University early on Friday.
"Wide Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head, which led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said in the media on Saturday, according to the 247s web site.
Wade invested to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the point of possession of the gun and confessed to shooting Wade Sims.
Simson was arrested without resistance and detained in the Police Department of the Eastern Baton Rose neighbourhood.
Third year student Sims at 1,98, who grew up in Baton Rose, played 32 matches, with 10 appearances as a main player last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Grand Pri of Russia: Lewis Hamilton goes for a world title, as the team's instructions gave him the victory over Sebastian Fetel
It became clear from the time Valteri Botas passed in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the match.
At the funeral Botas had a good start and almost hanged Hamilton, defending his position in the first two turns and calling Fetel to attack his stable.
Fetel went to the pit first and let Hamilton run in the tail of the race, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit one round later and went out behind Fetel, but Hamilton went out after a wheeled race, which forced Ferrari driver to accidentally leave the interior because of the risk of being subjected to a double motion violation in order to defend the third corner.
Max Fersteven started from his last position and was the seventh of his 21st birthdays at the end of the first round.
Then he remained first for a large part of the match, keeping his tracks aiming to end quickly and pass forward to Kimi Rikonen in fourth place.
He finally went to the pits in the 44th round, but he couldn't increase his speed to the remaining eight rounds, as Rikonne came fourth.
It's a hard day because Walter was fantastic all Saturday and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team went great and did the two," Hamilton said.
Body language was very bad
President Donald Trab sealed Senator Diane Fainstein at a meeting on Saturday to insist that he did not break the letter of Christine Blazi Ford, in which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Caveno for sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate's Committee on Judicial Affairs, commenting on the fact that the members of the Senate proved that people are "disgusting and disgusting and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate in the last days, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and rude and ugly and lying," he said.
"When you see publications and leaks and then they tell you, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you do the leak?
Remember her answer... you broke the document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Well, just a minute.
If we ran out... no, we didn't run out," he added the lieutenant's nickname.
Finnstein received a letter from Ford containing details of the charges against Cavenos in July and she passed earlier in September - but Finnstein refused to let the leak come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't break her story," Finnstein told the committee, as reported in Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as he asked me to."
But her refusal did not seem to convince the president, who commented during the Saturday's assembly: "I will tell you something, the body's language was very bad.
He may not have done it, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was charged with three women for sexual harassment, the President allowed the fact that the Republicans use the charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by using any necessary means.
You see corruption, immorality, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step on to gain power and control," the president said according to mediate.
Elite Lig: Danny Starks 5-3 Belfast Jades
Patrick Doeer put two goals for the Jiands against Dandy.
Dandy Stars took her lead in the Friday match at Elite Lig from Belfast Jaids, winning the 5-3 revenge at Dandy on Saturday.
The Jades took a easy two-goal ride with Patrick Duyer and Francis Boviyer's suit.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought the estate for the peasants before Düyer returned the Jäids parade.
François Busar was a fan of Dandy and then two gals from Lucas Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third match in Elite Lig in the season for Adam Kiff's men, who were winning with a score of 2-1 on Danti in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two groups, with the Jades winning the previous three matches.
Duyer opened the score at the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFall's assistant, while David Rutherford gave the assistant a favor to which Boviyer doubled the performance four minutes later.
In an ambitious period of full action, Sullivan put the field team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the aisle to the equation from Kauni at 15:16.
Düyer secured the Jäids race in the first half of the year when he won his second round for the night to the end of the first period.
The group of landowners was rebuilt and Busar was re-accompanied with a display of power at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined their forces to help Nealsen give Dandy the lead for the first time in the fight at the end of the second period and he secured the victory with his team's fifth round in the middle of the last period.
The Jades, who have already lost in four of the last five games, are playing in their seats with Milton Caines in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to rescue hundreds of aircraft passengers from a earthquake
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, losing his life in his attempt to secure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were ignored because of a major earthquake that hit the island of Sulawezi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong transfers continue to affect the region and many have been trapped in ruins in the city of Palus.
However, despite his colleagues ’ attempt to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunauan Agung refused to leave his position in the tower of control that he was in traffic, at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport of Palu.
It remained in place to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then on the take-off route, could be safely landed.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was broken.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's representative, Yohannes Sirett, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia's ABC News television network.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Calimandan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before he got to Palus the helicopter.
"We're stuck with his death," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the dead may be thousands, while the disaster management service of the country reports that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of the dead is believed to be going to increase further, as many bodies are still under decay, while many of them have not been able to reach them," said the service-type representative Sutopo Purguo Nugroho.
Waves that reached the six measures destroyed the Palus, which will complete a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a nurse brings bodies.
The clean water is a little bit.
Mining markets are all over the place."
Jean-Gelfand, president of the International Red Stairs in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Stairs is struggling to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joco Weidondo, arrived at Palo on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to complete any work related to the expulsion.
Are you ready?" CNN transmitted.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which cost more than 550 people their lives.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the crash of aircraft in a lake
The airline flying to a Pacific port in Micronesia now reports that a man is missing, while earlier it said that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely disembarked the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini on a type card stated that since Saturday afternoon it is not in a position to find the tracks of a passenger man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to identify the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the region helped save the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water as he was trying to land at the island Chuk airport.
The authorities told Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were waiting at the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact correlation of events remain unclear.
Earlier the US airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed at the seaport outside the landing corridor.
Some witnesses thought the plane was beyond the landing corridor.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane went down very low.
"That's very good," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others managed to get through the water that reached them as the average to the emergency exits of the inundated plane.
He said the airfields had panicked and cried out the same slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working close there to improve a submarine also helped save by using a floating boat to transport people to the shore before sinking the ship to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in conflicts of air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but in none of these conflicts Air Niugini was involved.
Analyst presents the schedule of the night in which a woman burned alive
The accused authority completed her purchase on Saturday in the repeat trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014 from Mississippi.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice Analyst Paul Roulet has spent hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone files to put in order the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Roulette said he received location files from various mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, lying about his previous claims, as reported in the Clairion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell the time he claimed to be with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford put up a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Telis was telling the truth that she was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "She was lying, because my truck was in Nasville."
Another objection was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Mobile records showed that they only knew one week.
Roulette said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Telis wrote down the mails, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"He wrote her out of his life," Hale said.
Defence is about to begin its purchase on Sunday.
The judge said he valued that later that day the trial would be brought to trial by the jury.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop three wants to question the negative view of the species, filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has escaped its roots, which were political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as the Fugees and the Commons experience a recent recovery in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
And another black?
Dana in New York sends a message to a couple who released her after receiving a "racist" message.
A dentist from New York is conducting treatment in a couple for racist dismissal after receiving a message that was mistakenly sent by her mother where the latter complained that the dentist was "another black man."
The couple refuses to be racist, comparing treatment with "exemption".
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that the new Aunt Giselle Morris was black, as soon as the last one appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr. Morris twice.
As soon as she realized her pitfall, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman no longer fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their outgoing aunt, who was African-American, had not done any good work and waited for a Filipino, according to New York Post.
Mrs Morris was paid for her one and only working day and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris has been conducting proceedings against the couple asking for compensation for discharge and claiming compensation for the order of 350 dollars per day for the six-month period of work as an internal agent for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he said to Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's about discretionary treatment."
The couple objected to claims that they were racists, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris, fearing that they could not trust her again after they attacked her.
"My husband sent her something he didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even mistakenly?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing treatment with "exemption", Plasco said his wife had just been born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you be after someone who's in this situation?
It's not so kind," the bank investor added.
While the legal case is in progress, the court of common opinion sought to condemn the couple in the social media, condemning them for their behaviour and logic.
The penthouse publishers feared that readers would not be interested in a bear who spoke, as a new letter reveals.
Bod's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone who read it for the first time before his release.
There's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the great success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who was working as an iconic on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a Lutheran handkerchief, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "sweet", as her father left life ago.
Regarding Paddington, who describes him as "a very important member of the family", he added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't proud," he said.
"But because Pentagon was so true in his eyes, it was almost as if you had a child who was building something: you're proud of it even if it's not yours in reality.
I think that's the way he looked at Pandington's success.
Although it was a creation of his own and his imagination, he always gave the honours to himself in Paddington."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to Nicaea’s Louis Paster 2 Hospital, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nand kept calling and told me that it was very bad, that he didn't have much hope of success," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Sometimes Nand called me to tell me she was gonna die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "So I love you so much, honey.
I'll be near you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive gradually weakened and came out of her body.
He had already died a few hours before and that time and now everything is gone.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, yell, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay cold."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far remained silent about her daughter's shame, boarded the plane with the other passengers who were ignoring the test she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down and they ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I was struck by a feeling of compassion for Nand.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women who pass the loss of their own faces hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphreys hang in a bridge in Wallia with emotional messages and phone numbers that can be called for support.
Her son, Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a very promising boss with a handy smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died, as he was in a very bad condition.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he ended his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm really worried there'll be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards to inform the people that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if they're your friends.
Don't be quiet - you have to talk."
Mrs. Hamphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt fallen or narrow or something," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
She had taken a walk on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, she didn't look them in the eye."
He said his death caused them a huge injury, but they have to overcome it: "It dissolves the family.
It's destroying us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Caveno's future is uncertain, as the FBI is starting to investigate.
"I thought that if we could really achieve something like what he was asking for - a research of limited duration and limited object - perhaps we could bring some unity," said Mr. Fleick on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be dissolved through troubled partial dissidents.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Their unwillingness is entirely due to the timeliness.
The interim elections are only five weeks from 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected not to do so, they will weaken significantly in their efforts to succeed in the election of the person they wish in the Supreme Court of the country.
George Walker Bus calls to the Governors, urging them to support Mr. Kavano, who was working in the White House for Mr. Bus, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bus's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report is submitted?
A vote will be taken in the House, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Republicans.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanos can have at least 50 votes in the House, which would allow the Vice-President, Mike Pens, to take the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of rebels in North Korea falls under the authority of Kim
The number of rebels from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young Yun came into power seven years ago, according to a South Korea legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, reporting data from the Ministry of Integration of South Korea, said 1,127 distances were observed last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the highest charges on mobile persons were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made public comments.
In the vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are drifting through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross compared to the heavily protected Destabilized Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers illegal immigrants to be non-refugees and often exonerates them through violence.
Relations between North and South Korea, typically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Early in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on denuclearisation, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trab and Kim Young Won in Singapore, where they agreed on terms of cooperation to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il accused the US of missing progress ever since.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions, in no case will we disarm our country alone first," Mr. Rim said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Brett Caveno "sterical," says he is unfit to serve at the Supreme Court
Vice-President Nancy Pelozi called on the High Court candidate Brett Kavano "external" and said that it is inextricably inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelozy made these comments at an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman acted in this way, they would call it "external," Pelosi commented on the Kavano's statement before the Senate's Committee on Judicial Affairs on Thursday.
Cavano, with a strong impulse, refused the charges that he had committed sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blazi Ford when he was both teenagers.
During his extensive purchase, Cavano was deeply moved, sometimes almost cried, and his voice was echoed as he spoke about his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Republicans to the committee, condemning the charges against him as a "teratically and coordinated political murder" organised by liberals who have been angry with Hillary Clinton's eight in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelozy said he believed that Kavano's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was pre-democratic.
"I think he has excluded himself with these statements and with the way he managed against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelozy responded when asked whether he would try to speak up against Kavano if his appointment was confirmed and whether the Republicans obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if it does not tell the truth at Congress or the FBI, then it is not only appropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court at which it is currently serving," Pelozy said.
Kabano is a judge at the Regional Court of Appeals (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozy added that as a Republican he was concerned about Kaban's possible decisions on the Law on Affordable Care Act or in the Roy v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kabano avoided answering questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court might be warranted.
"Isn't it time for an ostrich, provocative man to go to court and wait for us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified breakup, months and years of anger are fluttering and can't get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "It helped me a woman who was a prostitute somewhere, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique that when she was angry and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And that's how it just went on.
And it seemed great to me."
The fingerprints are permitted as a partial breakdown of anger because they are basically unclear.
One of my most intense memories of a job I've done before, in an office where men ruled, is once I cried with unrelenting anger and was grabbed by a bigger woman from the black -- a cold manager I've always feared slightly -- and drew me to a ladder.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're tight and they'll be happy because you broke it."
Patricia Schroeder, then the Democratic Governor of Colorado, had collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mrs Hart was arrested for having entered into an extramarital relationship in a ship called Monkey Business (Bromodulia) and left the struggle humiliated, Mrs Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason not to consider putting the same candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he said laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow and the Seven Children."
Because the campaign had already begun for a long time, it was back in funding and so it was sworn that it would not have entered the election if it had not collected $2 million.
The fight was lost.
He discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave it only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very heavily burdened with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than for representatives and anger with sexism - who felt a lump in the throat.
"You'd think I had a nervous clone," remembers Mrs. Schroeder about the guy's reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my partner.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write in my graveyard?
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war can do good in Beijing
The welcoming gays of the trade war between the US and China were revealing and while the fight has much to finish, a gap between the two countries can benefit for the long-term Beijing, experts say.
American President Donald Trab threw the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing essentially Chinese exports of products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation this week was the imposition of new duties on US$ 200 million (150 million litres) in the form of half of all products imported into the US from China.
Beijing returns the fires to species every time, while recently it has imposed a duty of between five and ten percent to goods worth 60 million dollars.
China is determined to respond to American fires and the second largest economy in the world is not likely to put it down soon.
In order to succeed in making Washington resign, he would have to comply with their demands, but to publicly appear in the United States would be too embarrassing for China's President, Si Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, American pressure in the context of the trade war could be positive for China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have admitted to the past," said Abigail Grace, a research partner with a study center in Asia, at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the self-refoulement of the refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the destroyed one since the seventh (and now) war of a country.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister William Al-Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the country's situation is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore regularity.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Mualem said the aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country is welcomed by the Syrian government.
However, he pointed out that aid would not be accepted under conditions or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe locks victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team won the Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US team with a final rating of 16.5 versus 10.5 in the golf course Le Golf National, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been killed 6 consecutive times in European territory and has been winning the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took its first place again, as the Danish leader Thomas Byron's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The star of the US team Phil Michelston, who fought hard during the biggest tournament, threw his shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving victory to the Francisco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari disappeared all around him, and so it became 1 of the 4 players who achieved 5-0-0 since the start of today's tournament in 1979.
American Jordan City was killed at 5–4 by the lowest player in the European team, Dano Thorbyorn Olsen.
The best-ranking player in the world, Dustin Johnson, won 2 and 1 against Ian Pulter from England, who could play his last game at the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran eight Cypels Rainder, Sergei Garcia was founded the most victorious European of all times in the tournament with a total of 25.5 degrees.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold on.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we took the cup back.
Everything is for the team and I am glad that I was able to help," said Garcia, moved after the European victory.
Gives the puppy to John Ram's compatriot, who won the American legend of Golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel the incredible pride I've gained over Tiger Woods, I grew up to admire this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost his four matches in France, and now he's got a career record in Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the largest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and has only exceeded it by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty finding a goal all weekend, except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American leader Jim Farick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
A few moments this morning we have pressured Europe enough.
We fought hard.
Congratulations on Thomas.
He's a great leader.
And his 12 players played very well.
We will be redesigned, we will work with the US PGA and the Ryder Cup Commission and we will move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
