I could've done better.
I have some English books.
Can you make them smile?
Tom can go if he wants.
I want to work with you.
I love wearing sportswear.
Why were you so scared?
Tom and Mary yelled at each other.
I don't even have a job.
I like to imitate Queen Elizabeth.
We should have told him the truth.
I'm so proud of them.
Who is he?
Is the supermarket open tonight?
I told Tom exactly what I saw.
Mr. Suzuki teaches us English.
What is the best way to travel?
Tom lives here with you?
What's the matter, honey?
I don't want them to be angry.
Is Tom really sick?
You didn't wash your hair.
I read your letter yesterday.
Go to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my aunt's husband's grandson?
I believe them.
She was fun with her son's babysitter.
I said it was okay.
I have no reason not to trust Tom.
He was the first to help her.
Are the kids asleep already?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleared the road from yesterday's snow.
I'm not busy at all now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Give me a move, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at the University of Hyogo.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life was going without problems.
Nobody wants to help us.
They talk very quickly.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there a lot of squalls on these sides?
Tomorrow, if God wills, we'll be with your parents.
It comes from Sweden.
He didn't have any money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with lice.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this funny, Tom?
Tom was born October 20th.
It's a nice picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look after me.
We humiliated her.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom's working here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see you.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We're having fun.
It's disgusting.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom was upset.
I'm already old.
I've got the dirty criminal fiddle.
Good night, my friend.
I bought a book in English in a bookstore.
Tomorrow I'm going to the bookstore to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Come on, everybody.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm coming next.
Don't say anything like that.
It's worse!
Jim's Canadian.
You did good here.
Where did everyone else go?
I'm relaxed.
The cattle were pampering in the field.
He entered his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom's still absent.
I ate the whole apple.
Roast the bhakri while the pen is being heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare water food.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing soccer.
Stop babbling.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I meant it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
It's good in this game, isn't it?
Take care of them.
I dress in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't seem too surprised.
I'm not going to school Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's unfaithful, isn't he?
Is this cage designed to protect from sharks?
Tom wants to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
Don't you want a job?
I was playing the trumpet when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
To write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate a apple.
I got him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to get more active.
Tom and Mary are joking?
She broke the smoke.
I don't have an alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What's he gonna do this summer?
He's got an irritation.
You know how to speak Shanghai?
He narrowed it down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was it paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold the fiat.
Am I in London?
She's still there with you, isn't she?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What's your favorite rapper?
Say hello to Tom on my behalf.
It's nice to see her so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why is he leaving soon?
I'm rather proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
I happened to sit next to her at a conference.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom presented himself soon for the lesson.
It's a little overworked, isn't it?
Who's the man who's playing the plan?
I've decided not to.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
I slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his time drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom beat her.
I don't have feelings.
It's incredibly stupid.
We're landed on a lonely island.
He needs patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When's your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
Today's snowy.
She promised to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot if you drink wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue." "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should've bought a used car.
I intend to stay in a hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
He can park here.
Please tell him to take care of himself.
Tom hated them.
I'm happy almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't spoken to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not very funny at parties, are you?
He found the keys to the car in his bag.
I really don't want to talk.
So he must be Argentine.
I really like my work.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
She's gone.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
She'll be out in the afternoon.
He's getting blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that picture?
How many are the continents of the world?
It's good to sing, isn't it?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
Your idea is superior to yours.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
It's a party tomorrow.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I'd like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy.
I appreciate your intuitions.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still sleeping.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He sounds like a drummer.
It must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use more?
You lit the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before we came to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.

You're going to the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom is nice?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I might know someone who can help you.
Do you know how to ride?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a model.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
It was published in 1969.
We need to relax, and that's it.
He speaks Chinese to him.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I'm just saying he was innocent.
The fear of failure is one of the most common fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you never have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue in check.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We left this.
All I want to do is go fishing.
Do you want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.

Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe us? We're in Europe!
Wait for a bus to arrive.
I found the chemist.
You'll never guess where I am.
I wasn't okay.

It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I don't know how to drive very well.
I heard Tom's learning to drive.
She knows I love her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is, we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I cut down the branch with an ass.
The minigons are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
You're Mary?
After dinner walking on the beach.
Why didn't he go with him?
He's two years older than he is.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.

She's stuck with the bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom's my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.

I like my language.
Why don't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.

That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing.

She has seven children.
Let's listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
You bought me a nice coat.
The bell sounded.
Bring it to the men in room 318.
I'm in love with her.

I don't like big cities.
That's what I got.
He doesn't have a few friends in America.

Take my shoes off.
I'm learning hope now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those yours?

Tom was a lawyer.
People here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is not expensive, they will soon close down if the food doesn't taste good.
The man they're talking to Tom and Mary is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of speech.
I'm free tonight.

You'll know her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock's broken.

What are you suggesting?
Be a friend of his while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.

They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It costs only a coin.
I hope Tom and Mary make a mistake.
My cuckoo's too big!
Give them a minute.
We eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture on.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried to talk to him?
Where did he eat?
He's the last person to say a lie.
June isn't that far, either.
Why does Tom hate you so much?
Do you know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes were wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you gonna leave me?

How are you supposed to eat?
I'm surprised Tom doesn't speak French.
He was playing the piano.

They know who it is.
Let's open it.
It is disease to be obsessed with victory, it is disease to be obsessed with the use of martial arts, and it is disease to be obsessed with presenting everything you have learned. It is disease to be obsessed with the attack, and it is disease to be obsessed with the defense. It is also disease to be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. Setting the mind ossibly on anything is considered disease.
