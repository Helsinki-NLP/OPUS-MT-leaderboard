Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvester infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and must no longer leave the farm.
A security service shall monitor the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively on the Corona-Ereger Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as announced by the Dingolfing-Landau Regional Council on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further expansion, we have to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven workers had already been infected in the plant - this was the occasion of the sequential test.
The farm is a large vegetable garden, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, coal and red beet - but the cucumbers are only for planting glasses.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a population of 3300 in the vicinity of Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder called on the citizens to remain calm: "After our information it is a closed circle of people".
In the court, infected by uninfectious workers were separated, the site is now surrounded by a lockdown.
Greens and SPDs were co-sponsored by the state government.
The two opposition groups called on Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of seasonal workers' accommodation.
"It can be hard when such local infections occur and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
This looks quite similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Shlachthof in mid-May we have already requested a special control program for farmers with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"It is precisely the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions that we see need to be closely monitored.
This is obviously not happening."
The outbreak was "with the announcement".
Aidenbachstraße Metro Station: Dangerous fight: 19-year-old falls into Gleis bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße Metro Station, a 19-year-old fell by a shoemaker and fell into a sleigh bed.
Obersendling - On Friday it came to a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße Metro Station at 4.15 p.m.
One passerby alarmed the police who set off with several stripes.
According to first investigations, a Municher (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man rushed across the railway station and fell into the bed.
People from the 17-year-old group helped the disabled climb out of the gleaming.
There was no danger of an incoming train.
As the police reported, there was once again a dispute between the two parties.
The 17-year-old fled the scene first, but his staff could be identified later.
Along with his father, he went to police inspection 29.
The 17-year-olds are diagnosed for bodily injury.
Report: Seahofer pushes for longer storage of data
The storage of data is currently suspended.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data after a media report - instead of a half-year for the ten weeks envisaged.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter about a rapid change of law.
Seehofer therefore intends to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He thinks it makes sense to "make the necessary adjustments in the law already," the newspaper quoted from the letter.
The storage data is currently suspended.
A decision by EuGH is expected.
However, Seehofer wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said that it was only reasonable to examine whether legal adjustments were needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer had already spoken to the interior ministers of the countries for storage in June.
NBA: Stripclub Founder for Clippers-Star Lou Williams
Exciting in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, should have left the tournament neighborhood in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a release.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he was still visiting the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta at night.
Williams, who should have given the visit according to ESPN statements, is again in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, notm. d. R.) have the best swings in the city".
On Sunday at Twitter, NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced that NBA Williams had ordered a ten-day quarantine.
Thus the Clippers star misses the first two official parties after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the crown season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season final starting on Friday night.
Söder expresses itself after mass infection to the corona position
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a textile resin for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen on our homepage live.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau County has frightened authorities and politicians.
At the large vegetable farm, almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working, over a third of them infected with the corona hermit.
The court is currently under quarantine and is locked up with a building fence.
No one can leave the land, food will be delivered.
The good 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer the authorities free corona tests.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Land Council has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the Court.
"Knowledge": confession of the alleged founder of Nantes
"My mandate has proved cooperative," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He is very sorry for the acts, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "punished by the bishops of conscience and taken very seriously by the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, the man was threatened ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged last Saturday night by a fire.
The fire broke out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory investigations raised the suspicion of a fire foundation.
The suspect now arrested had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
But after one day he was released.
The man worked as a volunteer for the diocese Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent entry into the church, he rushed quickly to the field of view of the investigator.
discuss abolishing the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that we consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should discuss, at least, conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," Grindel of the "Picture on Sunday" said.
He stressed: "For the associations that can become dangerous in the former Bavarian and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this context, the debate cannot be debated as to whether it is not necessary to involve associations that want to break into this phalanx to facilitate the inclusion of investors."
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations prohibited in the Federal League by the 50+1 rule.
"There is still a legal risk of attracting the Bundesliga economic location in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former DFB chief sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more balance of competition in the Federal League, in the end, will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already huge among the first three associations.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this mistake and went through the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of a expensive watch that had led to his retirement in April 2019.
"That's what I've been working on."
The gift worth about 11,000 euros was received from a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a violation of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"With the ominous gift of the watch, I have been completely transparent and Arglossic.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a cure out of the gift", said the 58-year-old.
"This can be called naive, however this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": injured and killed
The protests against police violence in the United States have again been repudiated by Donald Trump's use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between demonstrators and policemen in different cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration train crossed a crossing.
Previously, in Portland, there had been clashes again during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including the Federal Police officers, set up on Saturday night to tear gas and violently drove demonstrators apart.
Hundreds of partly armed demonstrators marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday and demanded that those responsible for Breonna Taylor's death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot in March at a drug race in her apartment in Louisville.
The objective of Razzia was someone else who didn't even live there, and no drugs were found either.
When on Saturday, a member of a group who himself referred to as the armed federation of black Americans gave a shot, three people were injured.
According to the broadcaster NBC, they were brought to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because of the fact that demonstrators of a white militia had also formed themselves.
Finally, there was no meeting of the two groups.
In the Texan Austin, a person was shot and killed during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
According to the police, a suspect was taken into custody.
More details on the circumstances of the act have not yet been made available.
According to the New York Times, Mayor Steve Adler told us that he was, like many in the city, "concerned and unconcerned" about what had happened.
In the U.S. Metropolitan Seattle, demonstrators also met with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to a youth prison building car, the police set up blend grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police or bodily injury.

The fire could soon be extinguished again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a number of people who demonstrated on a highway.
As the police reported, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital.
There was also a window in a courtroom and a fire was put on it, as the police reported.
Investigations have been undertaken.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historic Costumes Trotzen Corona
Although the big sauce in the resort was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy-flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big parties in the city were missing, the masses of people and program highlights like Saale, Rakoczy ball or fortress, many came at their expense at the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we managed to spread Rakoczy-Flar," says Kur Director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, as well as the historians themselves stood in the focus of the festival.
Approved atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for over 25 years.
So is this time in the crown year.
The couple made themselves at the Luitpold Casino, watched the historians when flaning and listened to Cuban live music at the gaming bank restaurant.
"I also find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
It misses the masses of people who otherwise do not belong to Rakoczy.
However, you miss the usual program highlights, everyone in front of the hall burns on Friday evening as well as the historic fortress and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"It's already bad.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy-Reitturnier should take place again
For the representatives of the historical curators, the alternative programme meant in part more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in a normal year in the fortress and is there to be seen on the corner of the Kurgarten café.
This year she was on her way to the city on Saturday and Sunday in costume.
"That's already harder, otherwise we have easier," she says.
The Rider Association had less to do, even though individual Riders were on their way to the park.
"We very much hope that the Tabernacle can take place again next year," says President Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021 there would be a Rakoczy tournament again.
28 Corona cases in Spanish secondary Fuenlabrad
The Spanish secondary football player CF Fuenlabrada is getting deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newling from near Madrid in spite of the first Corona cases on July 20th was flying to a game in the city of A Coruña, a deep blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, as the Club reported.
Fuenlabrad from the same city southwestern of Madrid had so far had the chance to reach the rise-up-playoffs.
Now even the descent to the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the state prosecutor found out because of a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority of the CSD is considering the forced retirement of the club.
Players as well as other team members are sitting in a hotel in Quarantene.
"By the sixth day of the quarantine, they have not received a fresh towels and no gel," the sports newspaper "AS" wrote.
Let's see in photos how players had hung underwear and club clothing in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they had to wash themselves.
Also, the bed linen has not been changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Either it's good or it's not good enough, "AS" wrote.
On the other hand, the club management told you to be satisfied with the hotel.
The protest that the public health was likely to be at risk was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
They did not violate the Corona rules set up by the Football Association, the son of the president of the Spanish Primer Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the departure, there were four infected until July 19th, but all were isolated and not accompanied.
Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were retested.
By the time the team was in A Coruña, it had been positive for "five or six" other team members of the Corona test.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the attack, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to pick up steamed horses

At the meeting of the officers, the horses were already between the porter and the village of Vampach.
Once the officers were able to win the confidence of the horses shortly before steaming, they were able to turn over each other to a rope carried in the car.
Cycling professor Tony Martin: Career continuation can be imagined
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time Time World Master Tony Martin can imagine himself continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just putting down the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurt General Sunday News".
Martin was currently employed by the Dutch Jumbo-Visma team and had considered ending his career before the Corona break this year.
In the negotiations with his team, he said, it is also about the number of days of retirement.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he got up after a crash, and the first thought was, "Quickly back to the bike.
Today I think of a little daughter as father: what if."
The bicycle profile admitted that there are quite some aspects with which it is increasingly difficult to deal with.
"But it did me good to note from the crown time what I had at the bike sport and how much fun it makes me."
The timer specialist will return to the competition events at the Tour de l'Ain (5-9 August).

Kovac is testing with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there is a review with his new club AS Monaco soon.

For the Federal Leaguelists it is the first and only hard test before the replay in the Europe League against the FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is issued without an observer.
"We especially look forward to this game.
It is always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac said.
Sports is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before his shift to the FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hessens from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-ranking opponent like Monaco is a good test for us with regard to the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing again with Niko Kovac," said Intracht-Trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrians had succeeded Croatia at the time of entry.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the eight-final game against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof near the Lockdown

700 dead by monsoon rain in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by heavy floods in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Because of the strong monsoon rain, a total of 700 people died.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
All villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzernaschures in National Park die by Earthquakes

Bangladesh belongs, according to the United Nations, to one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 by the river distributors.
So far, only a few have been drawn.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm is also held in Grenezn.
Who had a house before, it was still so small and like a cottage, often does not want to spend his life in a large dwelling block.
Many flats are empty, but - so it wants the government - to be referred to soon by those who have lost their house through the floods.

Argentina rejects the offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our believers."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer manageable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to renounce some of its claims of about 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country is again threatened by the state.
It would be the ninth payout in the Argentine history.
Recently, the creditors had demanded higher interest on public bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government remains firm on its last offer and is not willing to accept any further.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The last inflation rate was more than 50 per cent.
For the current year, experts estimate a decrease of about 10 percent in economic power.
At the end of May, Argentina had not been able to make interest payments of 503 million US dollars and was thus reduced to a limited loss of payment.
Professional arrival - not yet private
"It's going super well" - this fact draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notariat in Eggenfelden.
Everything went very quickly.In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would be the successor of Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelder notary.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the prom began the work, the normal daily business is long on full tours.
"I still have to come in private, however," she explains in the conversation with the Rottaler indicator and laughs.
Of course, the short run has not been able to move the food point of Regensburg completely to egg fields, reports the native Dingolfinger.
Currently she is with her husband, who is acting as judge at the Land Court in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for short-term parental leave to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 111⁄2 years of age).
In order not to have to hang out every day of Regensburg, she sometimes also has a stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains 39-year-olds.
Grown up in the neighbouring country, you are of course a long way from the town of Eggenfelden.
When visiting the site with her family in the past few months, she then recently found: "Eggenfelden is a very beautiful small town".
The more happy she was that she had made the race in the selection process around the free place.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home plays a central role in Lower Bayers: After the Jura study in Passau, she completed her referencing period and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notary assistant, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Lower Allgäu as well as Regensburg - at this time she also defended the promotion in labour law - she took her first place in 2012 as a notary in Rotthalmünster in Passau County.
In 2016 she moved to Regensburg in parenting time, and eventually she moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has undertaken representation services in various notaries.
When the place in Eggenfelden was written out due to the imminent rest of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for the full professional return, explains 39-year-olds.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the vacation representation in the notary's office, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and at the same time has a praise for the chancellor's team: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming movement of the private food point.
In the case of children's garden- or crevices, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything fits as you wish, she hopes to be able to get to know her hobby here too soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the red valley.
BVB plans to start a league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent by the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Because of the distance regulation that is mandatory, we plan to have 12,000 to 15,000 viewers at present," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer to the "day mirror".
Usually, the arena is held in the river town of Bundesliga by more than 81,000 spectators.
In the spirit games of the last season caused by the Corona pandemic, about four million euros were lost to the BVB per party.
The Cramer responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation at BVB hopes that, in addition to the normal sights, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can be reopened: "It is, of course, a blow to the office if these revenues are completely removed".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, all are currently "well advised to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer said.
The Dortmunder Marketing-Chief praised the BVB profession for its share-response to contribute to the overcoming of the crisis: "Of course, players know that their wage-response has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in the merchandising industry to short work".
Wingy Wonders: Early life start with a few hundred grams
It was hardly more difficult than a packerl butter, just three meals of blood in his entire body: it was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 mornings that will be taken care of annually at the Grazer Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few – like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael – are extreme lightweight weights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and early born that neither lungs nor intestines nor muscles are fully trained.
Sometimes their skin is so thin that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they're so tiny that they wear occasionally doll clothing and especially mini wings made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't vote - "and how", Schmunzelt Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even though, of course, they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the St. James gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actor Julia Sylvester from the theater of the city of Aalen presented to the students the production "Das Heimatwear" - which is video-based.
The students were then able to exchange the play and performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the extension of the teaching.
Even though all the participants agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional travel, the theatre also shows the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game business," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round: The TSV 1860 would meet at the DFB podal at the entrance of Frankfurt
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the lions will meet in the first round at the entrance of Frankfurt.
This resulted in the release on Sunday.
München - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB pod are fixed.
The lions would meet at the entrance of Frankfurt with a successful qualification.
This resulted in the release on Sunday night at the ARD sports show.
Because because of the corona pandemic the participation field is not yet complete, space holders were released.
The TSV 1860 is already at the end of the Bavarian Toto podal (4 or 5 September) due to the voluntary resignation of half-final opponent FC Memmingen.
There the lions meet either at the Würzburg Kickers or Victoria Ascharchenburg.
If Würzburg's two-legged climbers reached the final, 60 would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB podium.
Otherwise, the Giesinger had to carry out in the final match against regionalist Ascharchenburg.
The first round of the DFB pod will be issued between 11 and 14 September and a week before the start of the Thirdliga.

Kalbitz cast from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigerblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, in the view of the FDP, only a "fender sheet" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right extremes in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP Interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Court of Justice of AfD confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations the exclusion of Kalbitz, which was decided by the Federal Bureau in May.
Kalbitz is the president of the AfD Group in Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD really were to remove right-wing extremists consistently from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded for a long time," said Strasser.
"There is, however, no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and doesn't change anything," he said the "world on Sunday".
"It speaks rather of bands as many French supporters have a legal extremism in the middle of the AfD."
Flowers assume that in the future, the AfD will land under five percent in elections.
"The days of the AfD are numbered in the parliaments".
Kalbitz was one of the leaders of the officially dissolved "flights" around the Thuringian AfD-Lande and Group Chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection is regarded as a "secured right-wing extremist effort".
In May, the AfD Federal Board of Directors threw Kalbitz out of the party.
He stated that Kalbitz had not indicated any earlier membership at his party's accession in the currently prohibited legal extreme "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
The president of the Left Group in Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Court of Justice does not change the nature of the AfD: "The Wolf only ate Creed.
The AfD remains a right extreme party, whether with or without calbitz".
This decision will neither weaken the Federal Party nor the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meaten-Trupe is transparent.
You want to avoid another observation through constitutional protection and try to get through the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not run away the spirits that called her.
A draft does not change anything yet," comments Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Landes Association and the Group held their right leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday that he will now act civilly against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice.
North Sea Windparks deliver good 21 percent more electricity
The windworks on the German North Sea have consumed electricity in the first six months of the year 11,51 terawatthours.
This is good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet reported in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea current to mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have consumed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind current from the North and the East Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The windmills on the lake thus account for almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind parks provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due to higher production capacity in addition to wind conditions, as new wind parks have been online in the last 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea would all run simultaneously with full power, they could generate 6.7 gigawatt power.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; it is said to be at 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030, it was scheduled to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"To date, in Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet businessman Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can't even use their capacity on lakes, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2nd, when the North Sea Windparks produced more than six gigawatt power.
On average, the North Sea Windmills produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt power, corresponding to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the art association.
It was almost a small anniversary party of 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold exploded after the Corona break.

In the northern part of the gallery, the association "Sandögether" was involved.
Free: Windbergfest cancelled for crown
The Windbergfest won't take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years more than 30,000 people had attended this festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - in consciousness, how difficult it is for the participants - we have hoped for it until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (parthelios).
"But finally we are here as organizers for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands of people were on the mainland and in the mainland, minimum standards, hygiene rules and a follow-up to contact could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Crown Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, organizational and monitoring efforts would increase disproportionately by multiple.
Rumberg voted next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence, among other things with the winter mountain festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressur-Olympiaeger Werth not to beat in hairdressing
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic player Isabel Werth was the outstanding rider at the Dressur Tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.

More airplanes in Worms in the future
The Worms University goes on to the air: The "DFS German Aviation Safety" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the University and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professor there is the possibility to allow the start of the study not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This enables students to be trained twice as many as they have been.
At the same time, the capacity will be evenly charged both at the university and at the Air Safety Academy of the DFS.
The DFS will advise the university in establishing and occupying the professorship.
represent at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been trained to fly at the University of Worms in the Air Traffic Management course.
This year, nine students started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, and the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of study and Lotsen training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the Lotsen profession.
"In these times, it is not easy for us to promote economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow in the long term.
In order to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of the DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation's professorship is a future-safe investment that will provide the aircraft with a broad, technically overarching knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue to cooperate well with the university and at the same time undermine our attractiveness as an employer".
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms, also underlines this: "The Foundation's professorship is an important bridge between science and economy.
With it, we want to connect the existing cooperation with the DFS German Aviation Security as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's Air Traffic Management program".
The trust of the German Air Safety is for the University of Worms motivation and obligation at the same time to further expand their teaching and research skills in the future fields of air transport.
In the use of tomorrow's flights, the university with the first foundation professor for a dual course could place very special highlights and innovative focus for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, stresses: "The University of Worms has a unique setting feature in the field of air transport in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue helicopter landed on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully blocked on Saturday afternoon towards Ascharchenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in use.
A 76-year-old drove out at 12.40 p.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed on the main board.
As a result of the attack, the front airbags were released, and the driver suffered minor injuries in the face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old driver were cared for by the doctor and the patient flew to a hospital following the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of around 2000 euros, had to be pulled off.
Heil wants to examine other sectors according to the meat industry
The Corona crisis again brought the conditions to light in parts of the meat industry.
Law reinforcements are just ahead.
But they are on the right, and will they abide therein?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other sectors, according to the strict rules currently planned against meat industry irregularities.
"We will look at industry and then take appropriate measures for the industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer is already warning to restrict labour contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the Tonnies meat mill in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a Heil Act this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel in slaughter, slaughter and meat processing.
To this end, the use of labour contracts and loans should be prohibited.
President Ingo Kramer said: "Finger away from a general restriction of labour contracts and employee leave if you do not want to completely reject the economy".
For example, works contracts are the basis for their creation at the customer for wide areas of craft, construction and plant construction.
"The shortcomings of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil said: "My aim is not to prohibit work contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial company instructs a craftsman to build a security system, this is a very normal contract of work".
The German meat industry holds a ban on works contracts and leases in its own sector as a non-constitutional one.
It is not possible to explain why, in the future, there is a different right to work than in Wurst, as the New Osnabrücker Zeitung (Saturday) reports in an opinion on the draft law.
In the case of a ban, the consumer price would then increase by 10 to 20 per cent per kilogram and product.
Several Eastern European workers from work contracts worked in the industry after the results of an examination of the NRW labour protection administration for 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Wages were reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often poor.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, through "trike constructions" these have been treated.
"Now we need to be thoroughly cleaned."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to adopt at the end of July in the cabinet, there are also measures which not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher rates of labour protection testing or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The present draft includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Workers in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) holds more stringent controls.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many areas of oversight: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, for example, animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg at present".
However, more staffing positions are also needed for more controls.
Three deaths in the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultralight aircraft crashed into a multifamily house in Wesel in the German Federal Republic of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died according to the police.
A child has been hurt easily.
Two other people were injured in the accident, said one speaker at the Wesel Circle.
At the crash site, a parachute was found, so the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported in appeal to eyewitnesses that the plane was hit by a hot-air balloon before the crash.
At home it's a one- or two-family house.
More details were not known at first.
Rooming of Frankfurt Opera Centre peacefully run
A week after the expansions in Frankfurt, the room of the opera house in the night also runs peacefully on Sunday.
Recently, several dozen people stood on the spot, but left it at 1 p.m. before the start of the lockdown.
Since the early evening, the police have been using a number of officers, and there has been a larger police offer throughout the city.
For the first time on this weekend, from midnight a ban was imposed on the operating site where it was found at Krawalen a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked out of many of the holidays with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police entry, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday was also quiet.
Car overrun: Young woman in an accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar seriously injured
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at 1.25 p.m.
She was brought to the clinic in Kassel.
With the heat camera, the firefighter was looking for possible riders.
According to the police on Bundesstraße 83, the woman was on her way towards her place of residence when her car came off the train for unexplained reasons and got over several times.
In order to save the injured, the firearm had to cut off the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was visited by the tributary with a heat camera.
The drone stack from Warburg, which also works with thermal cameras, was also ordered for the personal search.
However, the forces of action did not find anyone among the high maize plants.
The serious injury was brought to the Kasseler Clinic with the rescue car.
Almost 50 firepowers of Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The Bundesstraße was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a rescue door by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin won the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world football team made the total 36. Scudetto of the Society's history with a 2:0 (1:0) on the Sunday evening at home playing against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before noon.
With 83 points, Turin, which entered without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, no longer pushed one of the games two days before the season end of the series A.
The table length Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Despite optical superiority in the first half of the year, Ronaldo met with the last action after a release.
An example of Miralem Pjanic earned the 35-year-old from the penal limit directly with a flash gun (45.+7).
At 2:0, Ronaldo was involved against the now offensive guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This was the unmistakable but decisive success.
In the 89th minute, Ronaldo was only allowed to have a proper look at the Torjager rating.
"It is complicated to remain mentally and physically on ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are rare, and the moment changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the spiritual creation of his players was great, said the Juve Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
At the end of the table, Juve had recently due in particular to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team only won five victories.
If Ronaldo is still going to be a tortoise king, it's a question.
Because while the Portuguese superstar reached 31 towers, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona has already 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the FC Bayern's title win.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentineian won 36 tournaments for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next title chance awaits the "Old Lady" of the Italian football.
Juventus is at the eighth final of the Champions League, but on August 7 against Olympic Lyon, he has to compete for a 0:1 stage to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as a opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors recorded
Stuttgart - All threatened penalties and court decisions, despite the fact that there are countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets, continue gas: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal authors in the southwest.
There are no comparisons for the years before, but the racers are doing more work to the judiciary: in the state courts between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, one year later there were 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The competitions were less about organised events, as the Ministry of the Interior responded to a request from the country-day SPD.
In most cases, the drivers were spontaneous or they had taken the escape from the police - also seen as an illegal race.
The tax was mainly for German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 Money Penalties - 15 Times Arrest
Only in relatively few cases will the racers be picked up and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 sentences have been imposed.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal authors actually increases.
Rather, other drivers reacted more significantly because of the various tragic accidents and processes of past years than before and showed more often, said one minister.
The 8. Motorway is especially popular with racers, drivers always brake out the traffic there again to get space and use the free route for a race.
Last August a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months before there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular race track
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
With a tempolimit there is tried to brake the racer on the particularly affected section between narrows and giesings.
Most of the high-priced and high-speed sports and luxury coaches often have Swiss signs because drivers avoid racing to Germany due to the high penalties for too fast driving and drivers in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the Tempolimit should not be reduced to a few lines: "With a general Tempolimit of 130 hours we would create this problem on highways from the body," says Martin River, the traffic experts of the SPD Land Day Group.
"The brake threshold for racer would be significantly higher if you weren't allowed to be legal here and there with 200 hours and more on the way."
From education or image campaigns, Rioir is less likely to be: "He who in this way deviates from all the rules and not only his own life, but also the life of other transporters is not yet at stake with reason".
ADAC calls for more police intervention
On the other hand, the ADAC is not enough: "We assume that Rasser will not be afraid of the Tempolimites," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even stricter controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon to experience a more painful and consequential severity from the high-speed power fair: from January 2019 to April 2020, three people died in the race, two of whom were not involved in a night crash in Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men were supposed to be delivering a novelist.
One of the vehicles came off the road, rolled against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old driver died.
21 other people have been injured in the race of the past two years.
However, more severe penalties are not necessary in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "The legislative need to punish illegal motor vehicles more severely is not seen," says the Ministry of Interior's paper.

Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police attack, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people participated in a "Tuning meeting" on Saturday night at the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police insisted on their announcement to strengthen the control of such events.

Illegal Tuning meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers were among the top of 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police are budgeting.
However, only a small part of the "Autoposer" and Tuning Scenes are to be assigned.
Apparently, the majority of the scene concerned came to the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons present on the spot, it should be assumed that this was mainly a joke.
In addition, the majority of those present maintained the current protection provisions for infection, in particular compliance with minimum standards and the wearing of a mouth-neck protection.
The on-the-spot checks were completed at 1:00.
In total, the officials in 10 vehicles have observed such structural changes that the operating permit has been granted.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No Autorunes
There were no illegal authors.
"The Central Frank Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on the situation and will continue to carry out strengthened control measures, including in connection with the arrival of bullies," it said.
The Agency News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger from the company concerned: "They have all the beautiful fields that we must not miss," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Even because the cars are wider, the company should be careful not to cause any damage.
"The young people are supposed to keep their cars safe."
Number of working agency: 900 cases of abuse in short work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) goes after its own statement about 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-term employment.
"It is extremely small in more than 880,000 companies that have shown short work," said the management board responsible for the operational business Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurt General Newspaper".
When at the beginning of the corona crisis many companies had suddenly applied for short work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test will last up to three weeks.
"So much time has not been available to us in this so-called phase.
The more we look at the conclusions.
I'm sure there'll be some more.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
References to abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the fall.
"Will there be much more insolvency than in the previous year?
The estimates go hand in hand, but we are arming ourselves for the case and we are already training our employees in the labour agencies to process applications for insolvency payments."
Still the numbers are inexhaustible, said Terzenbach.

A total of more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.

Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Governor Netanyahus are becoming more and more intense.
There have been violent disputes in the night.
During the night of Sunday in Jerusalem, the Israeli police were violently opposed to participants in a demonstration against the law-enforcement chief Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for involvement in unrest, police spokesperson Mickey Rosenfeld told.
The police used, among other things, water pumps to dissolve the broadcast.
A total of about 6,000 people had gathered on Saturday evening, according to media reports near Netanyahu's office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and netanyahus dealing with the corona crisis.
The Protestants beat drums, stood in horns, and called Netanyahu to retreat.
Participants in an event demonstration were also arrested who supported Netanyahu, reported the news page "ynet".
Also in many other places in Israel, people showed up, including in front of the private villa of the governor in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police reports near Tel Aviv because he is suspected of having sprayed from a running car pepper spray on demonstrators on the street edge.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protestor in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured on the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The announcements accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Finally Netanyahu was also criticised for his handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he has rapid lockdowns and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the economy of the country difficult.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent last year.
The number of new infections with the coronation virus in Israel has recently increased to new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter forces on car - nine injured - Ruhrgeitet - Bild.de
Ahlen - An accident on Saturday afternoon called for nine minor injuries on the B58 at Ahlen.
A driver was on his way with her two children (3,5) towards Beckum.
The police said, "I guess she was braked all of a sudden because she wanted to turn."
That must have been the driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her, maybe too late.
He was pulling back on the car.
In the case of an accident, three insets were easily damaged in the car and six in the carrier.
Several rescue cars brought them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea border city according to Corona suspect
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own measures to defend the Corona virus.
Now, for the first time, the country reports a suspect.
Because of a first official corona suspect in the country, North Korea has completely cleared up a large city in fear of a disaster.
Despite the most severe epidemiological measures in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been brought into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the emergency has been suspended.
The communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the case were to be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the affected country.
North Korea had so far not registered a single infection according to its own data and described its defence measures as "lighting success".
The data were questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were identified according to reports by an "outbreaker" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and most likely military buffer zone, there was first no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military recognised the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There were studies with some people.
North Korea has reportedly called for an emergency meeting of the Labour Party Police Office under the chairmanship of Power Commissioner Kim Jong Un on Saturday due to the suspect.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim has already arranged as a preventive measure on Friday to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others", it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had contacted them, were quarantined.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore to investigate the "expenditure" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, impose severe penalties.
Approximately 300,000 people live in Kaesong according to estimates.
Tension in front of the Council session: City-East and noise protection are still ahead of a big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the body will also vote in favour of the construction plan for the large urban development project in the east," it is said in the middle of the city press release for the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of CongressCenter Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrade of the eastern city is being discussed until the end of the controversy.
The majority for this is short, last but not least in individual committees, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), which is now out of citizenship and which is now being developed by administration and municipality, has not failed after almost ten years of preparation, critic Reinhard Klein criticised the project as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unaware", "speculation", "complaining" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks it's better to know," said Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Civilian List for a year.
In fact, after reading the contracts in this position, he was like, "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city than for the Technical Council to repair the city administration's statements after grants, from which the existence of which is believed to be small, for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently when forecasting in the Council and by the supporters of the economy.
The city was designed by its own power and not by an investor: this was its plan B. One day after a small one, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejected the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially the renovation of the Technical Council, the opening of the Schlossberg, the rental of the Ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller interior design in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental themes play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
In this way, the municipality will vote in favour, among other things, of the noise scheme.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road transport, including numerous temporary reductions.
In a press release, the German Transport Club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, political leaders in the city are not innocent of having to do so because they have contributed only to the massive increase in car traffic and thus to the noise by neglecting the bus transport with dilute rates and by little commitment to cycling, says the VCD.
The municipality also agrees on the involvement of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enczreis.
In addition, the agenda for the accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the country of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban children's day care facilities and the application for admission to the state's Smart City Foundation.
Citizens are welcome, but Corona protection measures must be enforced.
With a lot of delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost half a year's delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his first season in ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of the supersports car can take on the regular operation, the first test runs were now in progress.
For Zimmermann it was especially important to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has for a long time prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen turned his first rounds on the Lausitz ring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go to the curves differently.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Stein Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Netherlands has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges with it," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I are confused and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lauitzring ring".
Right there - on the Lauitzring - the GT Masters will also extract his first race.
From July 31st, the 33 supersport cars will be raced by the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of the 15 series newbies, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the motorbike.
"It worked fast and I had little to get used to on the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lauitzring has many fast passageways that you have to optimally meet in order to be fast."
As soon as room man is real, it turns out in two weeks.
"The teams are, of course, poker a little during the tests," he says.
"Finally, however, we are very happy and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a closed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races will take place.
Current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring Ex-form 1-pilot Niko Hülkenberg will be taken to the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister of Quarantine Decision cold
According to press reports, the British government's decision to place Spanish vacationers under quarantine for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold.
Therefore, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Because of the increasing corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London strikes the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new arrangement applies from today, Sunday, so that Schapps will also have to return to quarantine after its return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the scheme applies only to those who are only on the day of the holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is still considered one of the "safer countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers should have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be suspended for vacationers in Spain," Labour Deputy Diane Abbott commented.
"But obviously no one has made the effort to say Grant Shapp's message."
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the outbreak of the strict exit barriers, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists are especially responsible for nightlife for the new expansion.
Spain is one of Britain's most popular holiday countries.
From an unnecessary trip to the Spanish mainland, the British government is currently opting for the most popular canaries and balers of British vacationers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the new type of coronary virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in his country, on the day of the Navy, the equipment of the warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the fighting opportunities of Russian sea forces would be extended, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central Marine Parade.
The Ministry of Defence also informed Interfax of the successful tests of the hypersonic zircon built for the marine.
The hypersonic weapons show a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They're considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropodeo is further built
It will also be built on the underwater torpedo Poseidon, which was called the Underwater Torpedo.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also carried a military boat, said that only this year 40 new ships would be put into service by the individual fleets of the largest country of the earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Marine protected Russia reliably, Putin said on the day celebrated by Matrosen.
Also in many other Russian coastal areas, the sea forces begin the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting on the side of the ruler Baschar al-Assad, the military demonstrated at a gun show at the Mediterranean port of Tartus Stärke.
Ammo was also fired there.
A video published by the Ministry of Defence included not only warships, including a submarine, but also helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help due to the difficult crown
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's Atlantic season hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Centre of the U.S. Climate Authority NOAA shared the night on Sunday (location time).
Governor Greg Abbott called out the emergency for many districts.
The corona pandemic in Texas made the work of the helpers difficult, Abbott continued according to US media.
Evacuees Call for Caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is still being stepped up when it is thought that it is fed through an area that is the most affected area of the state of Covid-19".
According to the Johns-Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not neglect practices "that we have been accustomed to", such as wearing masks, the Governor said according to the CBS transmitter.
It was important that all the distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, Corona should be tested in emergency shelters.
Damages were first only reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning reappeared
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" was hit directly on the island of Padre Island, according to authorities.
The rainstorm had previously been elevated to the uric acid of the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm-flut warning was first issued and was later taken back.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" moved further into the country's heart and headed north-east of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurrika "Douglas" was on its way on Sunday night with wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour towards Hawaii.
However, the Hurricane Centre expected him to continue to weaken.
According to the forecast, it should be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (location time) - then as a storm just below the Hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA was expected this year after a forecast of May to be over-active Hurricane season.
From June to the end of November, up to ten Hurricanees could be expected to become very strong hurricanes, the Authority had stated.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which are developing to storm great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, an average of only ten percent, was then called.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was closely monitoring the storms and was in contact with the affected states.
Four Gates Recognised: Video Assistant "Punishment" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic was recognized as two doors
Naples - Four Gates Reached, four Gates Recognised: Sassuolo Calcio experienced at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Series A a black night - and was quite angry at the video assistants of the referendum.
"A festival not given to Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard on a team," commented the Corriere dello Sport.
The host of Naples was led by a door of external defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32th minute Philip Djuricic was first enjoying the compensation.
The video Assistant Referenceee (VAR) took the hit back due to a position of departure.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball again into the net - once again, the VAR.
Also the doors of attackers Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) also withdrew the division team according to the VAR.
In the afterlife, Allan made the 2:0 end for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar crash on the street and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides record," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began with a resurgence for double-player FC Bayern.
The Hansi Flick recovers after a short vacation and a few training days "sometimes well" has to consider after the first team training how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of World Master Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who is behind Captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, has the third most minutes of use, suffers a left-footed band injury and threatens to be missing in decisive royal class duels.
In Munich Schmuddelwetter the lawyer broke off a training game and was driven from the square with a golf card.
How long the unlimited stock player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
An action in the eight-final back game against the Chelsea FC on 8 August should be difficult to hope for the 24-year-old final tournament starting in Lisbon on 12 August.
The Bavarians want to get rid of the miscarriage from the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick called the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to the capital of Portugal.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be shown by its victorious title collectors in the next 28 days until the King's class game on August 23.
"We have simply mastered the duties with Mastership and Pokal.
Now it's still about creating the special," Flick said.
Until the Municher can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve concretely, the eight-final duty against the Chelsea FC is the first time.
After the 3:0 in the example before the Corona break, Londoners in the domestic arena should not again be like the lost "finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions, and think of trust with a good game," Girl demanded.
A match test stands against the Olympic Marseille on Friday.
With a long claim, Flick had sworn to his stars, who had been on vacation after the Double 13 days, on a one-off August.
31 Players he welcomed on the Säbener Straße, including the new players for the award-winning Leroy Sané, who, for the first time after his change from Manchester City, met all new colleagues on the scene.
"Leroy's got a good fit like all the new ones," said girl.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. can no longer only cooperate, Flick spoke much more about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, they are now trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are in contrast to the Flick ensemble in the play rhythm.
Thereafter, the Munichers could face a quarter-final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the half-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy", stressed the chief coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The WM record shooter Close and Flick know of so many joint tournament preparations, which comes especially with the 0-up-100 match.
With his current team, working was "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winnings" was an impressive attraction for his team.
During the tournament with Neuner teams, it was also a matter of curiosity on Sunday.
All of the performers were also the migrant Thiago and David Alabama, whose stay beyond the Royal Class season is not secure.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to forgive the WM title.
All American races were cancelled.
Running calendars are becoming more and more concrete
The running calendar of the current Formula 1 season is taking shape.
Three more races were added to the 10 confirmed Grand Prix during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring will be run in Germany and in the Portuguese Portimão.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fought for WM points on the Italian tradition race track in Imola.
This includes the 2020 race calendar after the current state of 13 runs.
"We are pleased that we are continuing to make great progress in the completion of our plans for the 2020 season," Formula 1 boss Chase Carey said.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the royal class of motor sports will be completed during this exceptional season.
Formula 1 wants to complete its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulation requires race on three continents
The Regulation of Formula 1 requires at least three continents to be awarded the World Championship.
Even if, as is currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to grant the title in the context of "extraordinary circumstances" due to the Corona virus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the impending coronary crisis.
A return to the continent is not a topic this year.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absesage hits criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, races will not take place in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil.
"We are looking forward to being with them again in the next season," said Carey.
The rejection of the American races was particularly critical in Brazil: "The resignation did not surprise us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not to drive in Brazil would also justify no withdrawal.
You must be prepared for the necessary security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's famous latenight show by video switch and shared in the interview, which she had in mind when she met with Donald Trump.
The air-conditioned viewer Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US-Latenight show.
She told, among other things, about her struggle with the powers of the world.
She also spoke about her famous "bad look" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been paying attention to her tireless use of the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans in the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your presentation and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the world's powers.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she was shocked.
"All from organised hate campaigns to threats, only because a group of children goes to the street" she experienced.
Heads of State and leading politicians who ridicule them in social media or even try to silence them, they find it "weird", because they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed on a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look behind US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Activist sailed the Atlantic, she was caught up in a strong view of the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip came a GIF, that is, an animated image that finally became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did 17-year-olds think about the US president at the time?
In response to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she only answered briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I believe that no further explanation is needed."
With the striking answer, the experienced satriker Colbert had probably not calculated and disappeared briefly laughing from the picture.
With her "How are you?" talk about the principles of climate protection, she stayed in memory at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac Founder Peter Green died
His life was like a train ride: After a fast climb with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply uphill and then slowly up again.
Now the Bluerock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult trailer: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully at the age of 73, family members informed him on Saturday in an official opinion, another opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the Fleetwood Mac band.
The fighter Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-standing band in London in 1967, until today his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is like a backstage ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest success then without it.
There should have been a fight among other things because Green wanted to contribute all the profits of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to perform in large walls and with a great crucifix.
Psychic problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
It followed a social downturn.
The Bluerock guitarist is under drug abuse and schizophrenia, as Biographies reported.
Green was treated in the psychiatry for a long time.
During most of the 1970s, musicians disappeared from the image area.
He was to live on the street for a while, working as a cemetery gardener and spending a long time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish worker family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
As a young man, he was excited about American blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of 11, he learned the first guitar attacks.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and was given the chance to stand on stage five years later as a lead guitarist for the instrument band Peter B's Launers.
A little later he was hired as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton with the Bluebreakers.
In the middle of the Blues tree, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green provided the group with the first number 1 hit in winter 1968/69 and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
However, the rapid rise soon showed his shadow pages: Green did not push the media volume, his experiments with the drug LSD became ever more extreme.
The life between music and search he commented on later in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
By the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac then swims without it in new formation on a successful wave.
Its 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes Green couldn't get any bigger comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of friends.
The British Daily Telegraph then spoke of a rock star returning to the earth.
Free of drugs Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blue legend at lifetimes - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
