The triumph of the right populists in Austria: they have 29% in total
The perceived weakness of both parties in the Great Coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian Popular Party (ÖVP), within which the current position of President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously vacillated, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the EU electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Deputy Prime Minister Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the Socio-Democratic (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, however, compared to the last 2006 elections it loses 5.5%.
Even worse, it went to ÖVP, which loses by 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian history of the Dopowarra and, above all, the literally catastrophic result of the populars, who have caused early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, popular people had a considerable advantage in their preferences in front of SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them because they caused the government to sink.
In the first reaction to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignations of the party president, Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could already happen on Monday during the extraordinary call of the party's leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the ever more likely way out of the electoral outcome, namely towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - Liberals (FPÖ) have made 18% in advance and 11% in the BZÖ vote - but socio-democratics have at the same time expressed the concern of another 1999, when populists agreed with the populists to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it was separated from the BZÖ), which has even been the cause of sanctions by the EU.
On this evolution he obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to work with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to enter Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, falling between Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of scarabs in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations, said.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after meeting today with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it didn't work out, then we'd have some cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
After the negotiations, Mukherjee said that executive power can hardly enter legal proceedings.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who has been seized by the ‘accused and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with that local in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher court.
Then he can ask for bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the Major Court and then it will be possible to obtain grace," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can enter the scene is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian Minister has supported.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been transmitted to India for many years.
Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a deep mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if he has received a promise from the Indian side to take care of it.
"I've got relatively many promises," he just said.
A Czech judge in the battle for marine foundations
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is drawn and adjacent marine zones.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small lost point in the blue of the ocean.
“L” island belongs to “Australia” and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 UN division workers on ocean issues and maritime rights.
His head, the Czech attorney director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and everything adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed is still hiding a poorly-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metallic minerals and other mineral materials, but also unknown living organisms so far that they carry within themselves the key to discovering the medicine against cancer.
The largest foundation of the terra farm
The coastal States have begun to provide interest in the sub-sea area.
According to the UN Convention, they benefit from the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is particularly the area of the so-called continental platform which often extends to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
Under the Convention, this has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words per continental platform it is understood that part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent below the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often more than 200 nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to seek legal and technical assistance from the committee.
The Commission has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success, which has considerably expanded its marine assets, has recorded a global echo.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the committee last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so much or less six times the same state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will be fruitful in the future from the seabeds, as promised, will be invaluable.
Other States will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental platform ends, the area of the bottom of the ocean that the Convention has declared to be the common heritage of humanity begins."
No one has ever been here in an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Foundation is not Klondike," says exaggerating Director Mikulka, "by the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their regime established contractually."
The Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If it splits with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization of "Interoceanmetal".
This was acquired in 1991 by the Convention, as well as by investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rustled, it's a nearly underwater replica of Tatry.
"It's possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich storage of polymetallic adhesives containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," another Indian lawyer Pakshi Ryan explains.
A worker from the Macedonia division Rober Sandev brings with him a repertoire to show him.
It looks like a little potato or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the wake of Golem.
Special German units were present for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is available on the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages kidnapped.
On the rescue operation as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and Internal Affairs, special German units participated.
In addition to the military specialists, the GSG9 units were present on the spot, the aviary federal police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the spokesperson for the ministers announced Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, in view of the danger of a force intervention, left the hostages running away.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We haven't arrived for luck," says a spokesperson for the interior ministry.
On September 19 in southern Egypt, aggressors kidnapped a group of travellers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end has remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
In the meantime, the liberators have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release were not explained.
There was no information in Berlin for when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Billd" newspaper, the 5 vacationers and the special units should fly with an Airbus from the military aircraft and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
American representation chamber rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the American Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
Dow Jones fell down.
By 206 votes to 227 the American House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and political leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been raised.
In a dramatic action, the supporters have tried desperately to persuade the critics from the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the negotiating leaders, encouraged Members to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to be grateful to avoid something that has not yet arrived..
While the Dow Jones suffrage was underway, it crashed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state rescue package could have failed.
It was resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts are now expecting other serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it is necessary for it to have the welfare of both the House of Deputies and the Senate.
Proponents record figures increasing bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the bill on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak conjunctivities, the desire to travel Germans remains strong.
On the bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a plus of the invoice of 31 % compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German association for DRV tourism informed Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, there are increased booking quotas for autumn months.
Therefore, the excess of travel agencies in October compared to 2007 would have been about 11%, the DRV reported.
Presumably for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, demands in particular would be travel in the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be travel targets particularly requested by the Germans Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as localities in Germany.
Above all, all travels include a high rating, explained DrV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individually organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, booking discounts made with strong advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
The summer months would also have recorded excellent booking figures, so much that compared to the previous year there would have been again an excess of the invoice - even if according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year, had passed.
My first time in October party
Hits by Ballermann, bottled beer from a litre and vip in Dirndln.
A show start
Susanne Kronzucker and I do not have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a Dirndl made of size.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, is common: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photographers are already shooting against us and shooting photos until they fill the memory of the photographic machines – very luxurious, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends are made.
Dirndl with two money seems to reach his goal.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually resident north of the equator of white sausages, the sense of well-being in the costume/dressing continues to be within the limits.
And instead, once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's brilliance gathers strange views at the banana stand to chocolate.
A monasteries tells me that I would have caught the grumpy in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the middle you are virgin, on the right you are engaged, behind the widow."
All of a sudden, I'm going to have to put my back on the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less noise from technical flints and wear over hats of fur, on which they wear "To drink to get dressed!" and they stretch their bare back against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibiting inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a scratchy "oooo."
This tells me, after he got rid of his bottle of beer from a litre drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, all of whom think it's a potato.
Bob is one of these wildbieslers.
Others do not have the luck of getting rid of alcohol this way.
Around 8 o'clock in the evening walk on the square of the feast the health workers, who must take care of the poor bees
The nurses appear white every time – every 4 times they drag a covered tent bar in the tent.
This works like with most of Wiesn's visitors: if you go empty, you come back full.
Those who lie under the tenton in this bar of alcohol in the blood, you don't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", screams one of the health caretakers and disappears in the baraonda.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in town.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, to Romford, but she died soon after.
After the incident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the charge of driving away.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Much before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, one of the most beautiful remains of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building is in cavalions between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building is slightly decadent.
But once inside the office ticket from the ceiling at a time, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most passage to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway running to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news about Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then, he has slowly gone into oblivion, far beyond history.
But today, this railway hub for Anatolia and all the points in the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever larger diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the Arkara Turkish capital wagon to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts in the AKP, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The following morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a race of submarines along the trails that produced the world-famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to return to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an exemplary move in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, more noticeably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by built-in shopping centers and power pastries, where managers in complete business - both men and women - meet to make contracts early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central-right policy from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The cold war was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its interior.
Today you have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But certainly at a certain point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "does not want to face that choice."
Then he stresses a point that almost all those with whom I spoke here have recalled: the links of not only the Middle East but also the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as far as Turkey is concerned.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentleman Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be largely in Turkey's hands.
And while I look forward to the ferry terminal that brings me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt about which continent to advance claims about this fascinating country.
Remember fast: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologic, September 11,) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under 21/, but when Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the crown.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to deal with everything the music had to do, both madrigal and Messiah, without accompanying or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often Tod was told to "let it be music to speak for himself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the jacket was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it ever higher.
John Freyn Turner writes:
If you were to nominate an orchestra director, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
During the last 40 years and more I have discussed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been in agreement with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated orchestral directors who, in his words, simply "carried around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurologist William Woodruff (September 25th) states that "in 1946 he resumed to study economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... at the same time studying for a degree in science, a letter and a PhD".
This follows from the note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chooses to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his pictures in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, even though they treat the protagonists with particular respect.
A show that conveys a lot of emotion.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda surpluses
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already very habitable, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
To all, a refined mechanic must be added, which increases the comfort of driving and allows fuel saving.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to that of the previous model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger size and new mechanics.
However, before moving on to analyse the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other producers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Just in Japan, almost a million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates were around 100,000 cars, assuming an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary are expected to sell around 2,000 Jazz units in the year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to .to reduce the fall in sales in Spain to a good degree.
In fact, the company's managers plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, i.e. 4,000 in less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - whose Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of the sales of Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in society in January in Valencia.
With respect to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimeters plus), the width of 1.69 meters (two centimeters plus) and the interest of 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in size, the residential interior is also extended.
This advantage comes from the insertion of a new platform, and from the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with double background – is 399 litres, that is, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of engine version 1.4 and that the capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear-ends or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions are opened with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also, engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with a petrol engine of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both machines include the i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics, and keep the engine pair high at all stages.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to use a power of 90 cv to 6,000 spins with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. to 4,900 spins.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of approximately 125 grams.
In line with the previous propulsion, which used 83 horses in the first generation model, there are now 100 horses available.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses achieves a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The "car water" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking for example the flight of bees, can avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, or the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the Security Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturing house.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
But the most important thing is the compounded eyes of the bees, able to see in all directions with an angle greater than 300 degrees, and allowing the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they have defined a laser location (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
"At the moment when an obstacle is encountered, the little robot imitates the movements of an ape and immediately changes direction by turning on the straight or larger wheels to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer leader of this project.
Unlike an ape, the robot cannot turn upwards or downwards, nor in diagonals; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can rotate and not exploit infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to produce the information every few seconds, and to act on this data.
It does not require the storage of information or intuitive logic of the previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozens of KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we are not talking about memory gigabytes, nor about mega."
It is the first step towards developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be serious in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the type with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to the destination by avoiding the obstacles in the path.
Stop before asking for a loan
We must recognise that the U.S. Treasury Department, as well as having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not without engineering.
In the face of the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from getting involved in money laundering in banks with doubts, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "False Credit Hotel"...or problems.
The tetro appearance of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to cause you to think not one, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do that, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information provided by the game is useful, but it is not detailed.
It is more a page for adolescents than a site for the general public.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, there's a bedroom in the hotel.
It's still something, because to buy a better house if you don't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest $9 billion in a 21% shareholding in the Company, following a net decrease in its shares in the Exchange.
One week after the conclusion of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would have purchased 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's equity at an individual cost of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The fixed price is less than 19% than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MUG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be based on an average price of $29 per annum, or a percentage below its current rate of 28%.
By 5:00 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley was down from $6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding company," explained John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to differentiate his actions by making it pass under Federal Reserve control.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than the previous one.
The methods defined on Monday also show that in the last few days the agreement has been amended: last Monday, Morgan had just announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese Colosseum for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought our participation ratio would be exclusively composed of ordinary actions.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would translate into an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter were exchanged more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow them to take investment opportunities, strengthen their budget and increase their liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency coefficient of approximately 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has stated that he has "clearly" relieved his budget from the end of August.
In recent weeks, the group has tried hard, which has seen to half the value of its actions, while the cost of insurance against risks has gone up.
The cost that flowed on Monday, however, remained at a high level, around 12%.
The week after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's discovery, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among Wall Street's major investment banks, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffet's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Founding the republic on socialism in the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales et of Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, he was the last to vote on the draft new Constitution.
The Commission's mission was that, with official results, 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on the basis of a vote of 80%.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the votes should be cast, more than one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the end of the polls and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a stunning victory of "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed gloriously", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, just as his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, did.
The poll, which took place in a calm manner according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state on the economy, reserveing it the "planning of development" of a country that lives essentially from oil extraction implemented by large foreign companies and consequently from their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants greater power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year term, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced the intention to take advantage of this amendment and to propose its own application for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states that health and education services are free, which the president has begun to promote in this country 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
19 free hostages in Ciad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive in the desert for ten days were reported on Monday afternoon, healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian command.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, about 15-30, on board a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to issue any interviews to the press, to the Maadi hospital, a residential area of Cairo, to be analyzed.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers", said on the landing track Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna.
On September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been shelled from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Egypt, the organisation agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, shortly before dawn.
"There have been casualties, half of the kidnappers have been killed, while the others have fled," said the manager who requested to keep the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lumpo" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by the German and Italian commanders.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we have obtained this result it has been due to the professionality and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese Pattulia army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board of which the kidnappers were found and to have killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to a Darfur rebellion organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), which was immediately denied by the latter.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the first page, a debate on the financing of culture focusing on the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will speak to denounce the poor amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historical sites that are starving?
What policy will it be like to remind the federal government that it is neglecting heritage monuments and buildings?
What in Quebec, like in Canada, do we have no real laws that really preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the only restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbours, it is the Constitution to say that the protection of heritage is part of a national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of the Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage goods, preserve, with four moneys, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are those who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space for history and heritage be reserved?
Benelux governments nationalise part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states, through partial nationalisation, help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis bank, which has ended in difficulty for the first time in Europe for the crisis in the US credit market: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of the Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this area can be a precedent.
According to Sunday night's decision, all three states will stop almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will sell almost certainly part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of the Fortis began with a vertical collapse, serious signs of the institution's crisis were then presented in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to fail.
The bank's shares on Friday fell by almost 12%, the lowest point for 14 years.
Since January, the value of the actions has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current prices of the shares, the group's entire capital value is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the bank's managers, this value is not real.
The company summit is responsible for the collapse of Fortis's operations to the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the title began to rise slowly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new bank manager.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers, but so far no one has made a decent offer.
The Belgian government had previously ensured that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
There was no panic among the bank's customers, the subsidiaries were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurers, based on medical purchase data from people, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like trusting the fox" - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
Insurance companies shall subordinate the insurance rate and the corresponding amount in the case of left-hand side to the health status of the client and if they consider too high the risk does not provide for the insurance.
A long time ago, the client had to submit to a medical visit and the contract was established only after the final exam.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer's identification code, you can easily have information from the medicines he bought in the last year and half, and from this the program evince which diseases he suffers and what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that the fat level in the blood is in fact infinitely high and is classified in the higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in trade, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer, besides paper work, is not much left, even if there are little difficulties.
Some medicines can be used for several purposes, such as some compounds can be used against the hemigraines or heat vampires, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance and commercial point of view, is a risk factor, the first two are not.
For the purpose of requesting and processing data, companies have been formed separately and these companies, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, require the patient's approval.
The authorities now oblige them to do so even though they have not so far caused much damage to the neglect.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medical consumption data to provide a more accurate picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and, at the same time, control of the use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a law apart from privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a proposal for a law that gives the authorities the power to control the companies specialised in the data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program linking the other data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned may not deny the approval so much because otherwise the insurers do not provide for the contract.
So then at the end the chickens are entrusted to the lenientity of the fox.
Global Marseille Menu
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade particularly each other, the agenda of the ninth summit was also dominated by this topic, as well as all the other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal primarily with cooperation on nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a great democratic power to which there should be more voice in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they reached agreement to double in 5 years, i.e. increase up to EUR 100 billion, trade.
Since between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods has risen from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements, so air traffic can also take its course in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit devoted attention to global façades.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both parties had a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would want to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to establish a global agreement at the conference on climate planned for the coming year and to reduce the production of greenhouse gas by 50% by 2050.
They also want to slow down the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
Today, the Prime Minister of India will be in the French capital where a bilateral meeting prepares to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that in order to build Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a commission worth €20 billion.
According to information from our printing agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian editors at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt awaits this edition of more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403 thousand titles in the exhibition and with Turkey as guests of honor.
He will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the ceremony of the opening of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow the meeting with the press at the Room Struktur in Pavilion 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of the publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books gradually decreases over the total Italian production, especially for adults and boys.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's rebate was found, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying on the Nevada Desert.
Rottami were found on a 3,000-metre high altitude plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Within the plane, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of the Madera County, John Anderson, ran away the doubts that still remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," said in a press conference.
The sheriff has thus stated that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63, was killed in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a team of investigators had been sent in a few hours after the notice of the rebate, which then identified the device: it was Bellanca 8kcab, scattered from 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some Fossett's personal effects had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a helpa.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had acquired a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of flying alone.
Three years later he made the world's round in flight and without a ladder.
Among his many records, he also flew 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
A Suv out of the schemes with an original design and well-defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and clear angles.
This is, in summary, Glk's last born among the "compati" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to sell novelty in this sector.
Just for its contents outside traditional cannons, it will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
So the advertising battle that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unpublished mode of communication also through an adventurous 3D affidavit campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A Maxi-Affiliations project, organized in three different stages, will dominate the central route of the Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the auto in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image will make you feel that the car is leaving the manifest.
Then, using the innovative Light8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, then recombined into a single image.
No doubt Mercedes is trying to reintroduce something into the stereotyped field of automotive communication with this advertising.
Will this formula be able to stifle the interest of future buyers?
Here are the Italian hooligans
From the Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy are ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the National Azzurra for years and that has so far, for the truth, never created too many problems.
He'd never met with the opposing fans.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The proponents come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia, groups (a few units, actually) from Campania and Puglia have been added.
They have three-colored flags where the city of origin of the militants appear: Saturday night they were taken away to not be identified.
They're inspired by the English typhoory.
In Bulgaria they found a true Nazi typhoory, that of Levski.
Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominations, therefore easy to control.
And the Viminale had checked them all: among those games for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited by attending a stage.
Four Azzurri typhoids, who had prior stage offenses, had in fact been denied the ticket and prevented the transfer.
The Viminale now expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international diaspora that prevents not only Italian stages but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in other words, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is fear-emulsion: that is, to those little over 100-50, they add more.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say from the Viminale.
So, "well-opened eyes especially in view of the national match of Wednesday in Lecce".
In fact, there is a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet, Tuesday the Cassms who can also count on a section of Asia, i.e. secret services, which deals exactly with stage problems.
"The Duke-Duce choirs and the arm tied during Mameli's nest? In Bulgaria it's not a crime..."
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Viminale Observatory (has taken the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly this in Trieste where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it was not committed to mistreat the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I do not make the sociologist - add the observatory's No.1 - the crimes should be attributed to the country in which the act takes place.
So far this group has remained in line, now we will see well what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But we're also talking about fish in Mameli's womb: those aren't guilty, but if you allow me, they're not education..."
