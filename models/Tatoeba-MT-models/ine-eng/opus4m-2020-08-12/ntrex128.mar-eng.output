Welsh AM doesn't worry about 'looking like maps'
Some AMs change their title and suspect MWP (members of the Welsh Federation).
This suspicion has led to a change in the name of the Assembly and a change in the plans for the Welsh Parliament.
The AM of the various political parties is concerned that this change will come to an end.
One of the employees said their group was worried about the title "Like Twp and Pwp."
For the outside readers of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means apple.
A play AM said the whole group is "disastered" and the options are suggested.
A Welsh Conservative said that the name changed to "free mind", but MWP has shown that MWP is a bit of a literal torture.
In this regard, the reference to Welsh is made in the same way as the Yorkshire U.S.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently planning the bill to launch a change in the name, said: "Any final decision to name the Assembly members will depend only on members."
Wells government has granted Welsh Assembly the right to change its name by law 2017.
In June, the Commission published a conclusion to the public consultation on these proposals, in which the Assembly was shown to have extensive support for the naming of a Welsh Parliament.
With respect to the title of AM, the Commission has shown no support for Welsh Parliament members or WMPs, but MWP has received the most support for the public advice.
AMs, the alternative options are suggested, but the struggle to engage in math can be a dead end for the back officials, Elin Jones, who are expected to present the bill of change within a few weeks.
These amendments will include other changes to the Assembly’s working arrangements, which will include rules on AMs’ integrity and committee structure.
When they discuss the law, they will be asked what name they should speak of.
Macedonians will contribute to the renaming of the country
Officials will discuss whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
It is popular for decades in the region of Macedonia, with neighboring Greece.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of this neighbor from the north is like representing him on his own territory and that EU and NATO members have made an ongoing effort to give him.
They have said that we should ignore the fact that the president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, is an opposer of the changing government.
However, with Prime Minister Zoran Zave, the government’s supporters claim that the name change is only a price to be included in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s hours calmed down while the churches in Harlem were struggling
"Historicly, the elderly whom I spoke to felt there was once and for all on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, none of it."
They said that it was as if the bar was invisible.
"People come together in different ways," they said today.
"The stock exchange is no longer the living room of the neighbor's house where people go on a regular basis."
As for the church, they are concerned that the money sold from the sale of the property will not last long, "and soon or in time they will return to their original place."
They also said that buildings can be built instead of churches, where there will be communities filled with people who don't help the local shelters.
"The majority of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be losers," they said, "and the time will soon come for these churches to be completely closed because most of the people who come to live in these condominiums cannot be members of this church."
A decade after St. Martin’s death in 1870, the Great Town - Harlem was built by groups of gangsters before they became agricultural towns.
The original gang of Methodists came out in 1930.
This building was owned by a group of farmers who were praying nearby.
A group of peasants led by Rave John Howard took control of St. Martin, who had led the 125th Street Ritters eviction, was the main shopping street in Harlem, and opposed the work of peasants or the peddonation.
The building was damaged by a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, starting with Carolon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and the successor of St. Martin, proudly named Carolon as the "Hours of the Poor".
In July, Carolon's playful science called him "a cultural treasure" and "a strange historical song."
This scholar, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that the first carilon in the world to be played by Aragonian, Dionysius A. Lind, who spent 18 years earlier in the Riverside Church in greater Carilon.
In the meantime, he was a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and he was appointed to serve as a member of the Governing Body.
In the past few months, what happened in St. Martin’s was the story of a multitude of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by church leaders, and others by Episcopal Diocese.
The Westry – the governing body of Paris, made up of the general leaders – expressed concern when writing Diosis in July that this diosis would try to place "the Father of the Cost" on the West, but did not share in appointing the architects and contractors sent by Diosis.
In the first century C.E., the apostle Paul wrote: “We have a wrestling, not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places. ”
In California a 13 - year - old boy was injured by a shark on the Lobster Drive.
The authorities said that on the first day of Lobster Hungam, a 13 - year - old boy was attacked by a shark when he was shot for Lobster.
The attack took place at 7 p.m. on the Bikens coast in Ensinatas.
Chad Hamle told KSWB-TV in San Diego that when they arrived with their friends on Saturday morning, about half an hour later, they heard a son crying for help and went to him with a group and helped him get out of the water.
Hamlani said that she felt a bit of a loss when she first caught the Lobster, but then she said, "He's been shouting, he's got me!
I've got my key!'
He had his whole shoulder broken," Hamlani noticed after he saved the boy.
"I called everyone and told them to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hamlani.
The boy was told that he had been taken to the Red Children Hospital in San Diego, where his personality was serious.
The people in charge of this attack were not able to understand the shark.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gailles stated in a newspaper that the shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous population.
In the case of a child who is injured in a serious injury in the upper part of the body, Gaille says: “I have no idea what I’m thinking.
The officers, because of the surveillance and the security, stopped them from entering into the sea by the border of Asenas, from 48 hours in advance.
In the United States, over 135 sharks are found in the United States, but most of them are not dangerous.
UK is planning to enter a beautiful device market
The sensory department store-style booties are supporting bootes, superdrives, and debenhams by appointing expert assistants.
As the UK’s £2.8bn beauty product is part of a large market share, fashion and homeware sales are constantly increasing, the larger buttocks will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country, and if successful the next year will be taken to more stores.
At one time, the search for ways to use the self - storage space used by TV, microwave, and homeware has resulted in the discovery of beauty products.
Sensbury said that brands such as Revolon, SCE, Twisherman, and Dr.
The current ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be found in the branded areas of shops such as Butts.
This supermarket is also relaunching its boot makeup range so that most products will be suitable for branching – a growing demand by young buyers.
In addition, the Perfume Riteller Fragrance Shop will see two plumbing in the Sensbridge Stores, in the first week of the year, opened in Kraydon in South London, and the second year later, will open here in Sally Oak, Bermingham.
In online shopping and local stores, it's important to get people to be drawn to Supermarkets to buy food a little bit every day.
Sensbury's Chief Executive, Mike Kup, said that these sales centers are growing like department stores at the same time trying to deal with more services and non-drugs than the supermarket Chen Aldi and Lidl Disaunters.
In Sansbury, hundreds of stores, Argos Outlets have been built, and since they bought these two opportunities two years ago, they have also started many habitats, which they believe have been successful in increasing rental sales.
This was the first time that this supermarket had failed to reform its structure and its structure.
In 2000, Sansbury tested a joint venture with Boots, but it fulfilled the promise of sharing what it would do with the production department in its supermarkets in the chemist store.
This new protection, Sensbury, has come after the owners of the Lloyds Farms China, sold £125m to their 281-store company Celesio.
He said that four stores would play a role in the Lace Skinker Brands La Roshe-Pose and twenty-six large-scale Lace Skinker Brands plan.
Paul Mills-Hex, the commercial manager of Sensory, says: "We have changed the shape of our booties so that the environment will grow for our customers.
We have also been especially diligent in the work of the elders, who will be ready to give counsel.
Our brand range has been created according to every need, and because of the attractive environment and easy places, we are beautiful places that challenge the old method of purchasing."
After Holly Willobby took £11 million back from the deal, Peter Jones 'stumbled'
The TV representative Holly Willoby announced that he and Marks and Spencer and ITV had raised a £11 million share with his Lifestyle Brand Business to focus on their new focussing on their new centers.
Willobby doesn’t have time for his homeware and his 18 - year - old brand Truely.
This business is compared to the palm tree’s secret brand in Guyana.
This morning’s representative, 37 of us, announced that we were leaving.
Holly Willobby has recently left his career as a Lifestyle Brander and set the goal of the Dragons Dan Star Peter Jones — and with Marks and Spencer and ITV, he has focused on his new great concerts.
According to sources, when the popular girl on TV, Marlo, at the Binghamshire headquarters of his business empire, admitted on Tuesday that she had not had enough time to pay attention to her homeware and to the Oxera brand Truthy.
This business is compared to the palm tree’s secret brand in Guyana, which is estimated to be worth £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, announced that we were leaving the truth from the Instigator, got off the train from Britain and went to our Hollywood home.
One source said: “Truly was at the top of the holly list today.
This would have been her long - term future, which would have resulted in her success over the next two decades.
Her decision to leave was a surprise to everyone.
No one believed what was going on on Tuesday, so close to the opening.
There's a bee full of stuff in Marlo's office that's ready to sell."
According to experts, one of Britain’s most trusted stars, the release of six mornings, the production of kundles, and the use of clothing from various household items would cause a huge loss to the farm’s attention, and its onset could be further delayed.
And long - term friendship can end.
The three - year - old Willobi and his husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to John and his wife, Stara Cap.
With Willoby Cap and Jones, Truly was established in 2016 and was appointed president of 52 - year - old Jones in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones has 40 percent of the flat - roof TV industry in Baldwin.
Willoby M&S will become a brand ambassador and ITV will host Aunt McPartlyn as the host of the ITV.
A nearby source of Jones said last night, "We won't talk about these business events."
And there was much silence; and we fell in love.
According to some, saying "unprecedentable to the president" and saying that the presidents of North Korea are so positive, he lied about the stability of the media.
Why has the president of the United States left so much behind?
Trump described his design in the "New Anchor" style.
"I didn't leave anything."
They pointed out that after the initial meeting in Singapore in June, Kim wanted another meeting as a major step toward the disarmament of North Korea.
However, parts of unarmed society have been sealed.
Three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korea's Supreme Minister, Ry Yong, told the world leaders of the United Nations. At the general meeting, world leaders said on Saturday that the move to unarm North Korea does not seem to have received a "dedicative response" from North Korea.
Instead, they pointed out that the United States is under ban.
Trump expressed a more optimistic view in his conference talk.
"Our relationship with North Korea is going very well," they said.
"We must fight against North Korea.
In the first century C.E., the apostle Paul wrote: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near. ”
Now we've created this wonderful new world."
Kim has found that her efforts to improve her relationship with Jehovah’s Witnesses have led to positive results — rocket tests have stopped, relief efforts are being made, and remaining U.S. workers are returning home.
They also supported their unusual view of talking with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to enter 10,000 people in this area, it's probably better to be 200 people here," the Trump pointed out to the ring that was in front of us.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was reported that foreign organizations were not in need.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared a precedent for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that we are not asking for international assistance, so it is very challenging," said Mrs. Sumbang.
Sev The Children is preparing an association to go to the Palu, if foreign workers can work in a clear location, it is still unclear.
Speakers of the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that foreign organizations could be allowed to contribute to the relief work to study the situation in Palu.
In the face of an ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, this country is very poorly equipped to deal with natural disasters.
Although the Tsunami are built in Elah, they are not easy to find on the other side of the border.
Although a warning has already been given, it is possible that a tsunami in the city of Palu did not occur in Siren.
In good times, it is challenging to travel throughout many islands of Indonesia.
In some cases, it may be difficult to find a solution to the problem.
A hospital in Lombocca is heading toward Palus, but it will take him at least three days to reach the new place of distress.
President Joko Vidodo had set the goal of improving Indonesia’s developed facilities in the preaching work, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial misgivings are threatening Mr. Joko’s administration, and the next year they face another election challenge.
In the face of Mr. Joko, there is also the pressure of long - standing ethnic tensions in Indonesia, in which Muslim members have chosen a more difficult way of worship.
Christians and Muslim groups killed more than 1,000 people by using knives, arrows, and guns, and by fighting in the streets, thousands of people left their homes.

Cromwell's statue of the world's 'History Review' is a recent commemoration of the debate
If he were to be removed, it would be like giving a poetic judgment because the Puritans of his stubborn head have destroyed many of England's cultural and religious arts.
But Cromwell Society says that Mr. Creek's instructions are "stupidness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
Cromwell's president, John Goldsmith, said: "The ongoing debate about the removal of the statues has led to the loss of the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace of Westminster.
The English Memorial war was not meant to be celebrated by Cromwell or to be produced.
Perhaps their father Thomas in the previous century would have been killed by a wrong chromosome for his actions.
Sir William Hamo Thornicroft's excellent description of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and is part of the historical record of many who still believe.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunde Telegraph: "Many believe that, perhaps in the 19th century more than today, Cromwell, in the wake of the 19th century, was a supporter of the Constitution than outside pressure, that is, of politics.
This description is completely correct, and it has continued to be a subject of historical debate.
And one thing is that in the middle of the 17th century, the struggle has shaped the later development of our country, and Cromwell is a personally recognized person who represents one side of the valley.
His duties as Lord Protector are also solemn and memorable."
The Chinese farmer was hunted by a black donkey
The local media report that a pig attacked a farmer in a market in the like part of China and killed him.
The name of this person is known to be "Yuan," and he was found dead in a state of bloodshed, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that he had fallen into a blood clot in the Lupansui market in Gwissau.
In China, on May 30, 2005, a farmer was preparing for the burial of the divers in a hager.
He was told that he had come from Greece to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his older brother found himself in a state of death, and he found that the door of a neighbor’s door was open.
He said that there was a large male who was bleeding from the mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the farmer had been killed in a 550 - pound [550 kg] pig.
"My brother's feet were bleeding and confused," said other brothers, whose name was Guyang Evining News.
According to the security camera, Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 4:40 p.m. to feed his ashes.
He died about an hour later.
He was not the owner of his brother’s brother - in - law, Euan, who killed him.
One market manager told Ivining News that he had been locked up so that he would not be attacked by a bully, collecting evidence from the police station.
The officials of the family and the marketplace of Yuan are actively sharing in providing relief for his death.
Even though it is so, the dust of the earth has been for a witness against the people.
In 2016, a woman in Massachusetts attacked her husband and seriously injured him.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound [650 kg] pig was loaded with a Welsh farmer’s tract, and his wife threw it away.
After eating a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Menitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but can make them "sweet".
"They're just playing games.
They're bones, they're very explorers... they don't hurt you.
You just have to respect them to that extent," they said.

Over 20 decades ago, people saw Brett Cavenvo’s hearing
Brad Keveno, appointed by the Supreme Court, and a woman alleged to have been sexually assaulted in the 1980s, observed by Christian Blase Ford on Thursday, more than 20 decades ago, six television networks.
In the meantime, during the five political years, the broadcasters finally launched a regular program on Friday: an agreement made by Arizona Sen: the FBI will hold a week-long campaign on the charges of Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Cinnet Judicial Committee that Kevino was convinced that he had caught us drinking at a high school party and had tried to take our clothes off.
Kevino, who has been a zealous Witness for over 100 percent, said that we are sure that this has not happened.
On Friday, more than 20-4 decades later, Nelson reported that the witness could have been seen.
This company is counting the number of average viewers on the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channels and MSNBC.
Their statistics were not readily available by other networks with PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks.
Nelson usually has some problems with the number of people who see him in the office.
In this regard, this number is similar to the number of spectators for the Academy in the face of the football team or the football team.
Nelson, who is a strong supporter of Kevino’s appointment, said that the Fox News Channel, estimated that an average of 5.69 million viewers and the entire network, had been raided throughout the day.
ABC 3.26 was on the other side with a million viewers.
Nelson reported that 3.1 million CBS, 2.94 million NBC, 2.89 million MSNBC, and 2.52 million CNN observers.

After the Central Republic office issued a request to protest on the side of Kevino, the CNN and CBS Chambers briefed them on Friday morning to attend the hearing of the Judicial Committee on which observers were attending.
They stood down and stood up for several minutes, and the launch was immediately lifted by CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do we think these countries are telling the truth?
They said to him, "You have power over all women, and you have power over them."
Fletch explained that his office had continued an application and that before the Elevator was shut down, he said that we should tell the committee more about it.
When the judge's committee to send Kevin's name direction to the entire scene, cable and broadcast networkxes were launched several hours later.
But Flake said that only on the basis of the understanding that the few democrats are asking for will we do so on the basis of the fact that the FBI is going to prosecute the charges against them for the following week.
As a result of conversations with our missionary, Democratic Senator Chris Counce, Flek was partially convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flemish decided.
The flag had power, since the Republicans would not agree to grant consent without checking.
The FBI has initiated an investigation of charges against Kevin’s president Trump.

Despite a brief victory in the regional elections in December, Catalan freedom supporters have struggled to keep their pace this year, and many of their popular leaders have given up on themselves or are waiting for their role in public events and subsequent freedom proclamations.
John Pig, a 42 - year - old mechanic, told the police that both sides of the conflict had been supported by politicians who supported the ban.
"The battle is getting more tense," they said.
On Saturday, from the end of last year, nine Catholic leaders in pre-trial detention, Oriol Junckeras, announced that the European elections will be fought next year.
"It's the best way to stand up for the European election to condemn the riots and the Spanish government's condemnation of our muscosa."
London: After the car entered the house, men were arrested
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested for driving a car into a house in London.
On Thursday, about 19:30 p.m., the event took place in Balinagrad Crecent.
Bob Blemingz, the overseer of the entrance and construction department, said that he had been damaged.
A crossbow may have been thrown on that car for a while.
On Monday's attack, Livington won 1-0 on the Rangers
The first round of Dolly Menga for Livingston won
Steven Garardt, a manager of the Iberbrooks Club, was amazed by the Rangers ’ second victory at the 18th game.
In the wake of Dolly’s attack, Gary Holt and his wife, who were serving at the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany, joined him on the other side of the Iron Curtain.
Garard’s team was defeated without victory in the Prime Ministership, and the following Sunday, they will meet with the hearts of eight of them in battle.
In the first century C.E., Jehovah’s Witnesses in the United States, and in the second century C.E.
In the meantime, Livingston will continue its six - forward course in the department, and their instructors, Holt, have not lost sight of the fact that the Kenyan miller last month took supplies.
Livingston seized the opportunity to visit the boat
Holt's company was supposed to have a long time ago to get credit, because their exact hit was completely in trouble with the Rangers.
Scott Robbinson ran the wheel wheel, but he ran in front of the ball, and then Allon Lithgon moved Craig Holkat's head into the ball and could only expand his efforts.
The host organization knew that the guests could be in trouble, so they agreed to let the rangers play before them.
In time, he became a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and in that way he became an important member of the Governing Body.
The Rangers gave him a free kick, and Livingston was released. Decklan Gargarhahr and Robinson pair accompanied him on Monday, he took control of Chandu and shot him in the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers had maintained their power, but they had been denied the protection of the opposing organization, and the shooting was not very difficult.
The same pattern will remain in the other half, but Alfredo Morelos had to be protected.
The ranger’s helicopter, Allon Maggragor, took Scott Pittsburgh’s feet and sent a further château from Līthgon to Līvingston.
Crosses continued to come and be removed in a box in Livingston, but two panels were left behind — the challenge to Glenn Middleton’s replacement — and one for the handball.
- Analysis by 'first' Livingstone
Alassdeer Lempart Toni Macroni Erina, Scotland
A powerful game and a draw for Livingstone.
The man was very good at playing, and he did more than expect.
Their style and style of play have changed little since they returned from the highest level, but after the Holt came, he has to give great credit to the way he shaped the organization.
He had a lot of money.
Captain Halkatt played with his heart, led a well - designed defense board, and kept an eye on Choir Goldson and Voral.
However, the rangers were less motivated.
As much as they were under Gerard’s leadership, they were less likely to play their own games.
Their final game was invincible — only once they violated the local organization — and it was a warning for the Rangers in the center of the country.
Welcome to Ardogan’s Colony
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for the sake of the Nazis, the atmosphere of joy was everywhere on Saturday (September 29th).
President Erdogan's controversial German tour is the last day to improve relations between NATO's friends countries.
Human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s EU membership remained at odds.
In time, we were able to open up a new church in Ardogan Colon.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police reported on the security of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters had gathered to see their leaders.
Hundreds of people who had to stand up to Ardogan — many of whom were Kurds — also heard their voice, banned Ardogan’s protests and the German government’s decision to welcome their country.
Some German Turks viewed him as a hero and shared the views of these guests who were expelled from the realm of the emperor.
Dept.ford Road: A car crash and a bicycle crash
In London a car was parked and killed on a bicycle.
This accident, a busy street in Deptford, near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, was played in the city's fire area, estimated at 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics helped, but on Saturday he died at the scene.
A few months after the fall of this Saturday, the second accident occurred in a danger on the Children’s Street.
Metropolitan police reported that they are responsible for identifying the deceased and reporting his close relatives.
Roads have been blocked and bus routes have been changed, and drivers have been advised to avoid that part.
Long Latin Prison: Six Infectious Infects
After being sentenced to a very safe prison, six prison officials were reportedly injured by the prison officials.
On Sunday 09:30 BST, the gap in the HMP Lang Martin began and is beginning.
To deal with this scourge, the wise "Tornedo" officials have been called, and eight prisoners are involved in this scourge, and it is limited to one wing.
And they were hurt at the presence of the chief priests, and were healed.
One prison service spokesperson said: "The special training prison workers are being trained to deal with this event in HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers were treated for their injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will be sent to the police, and they'll have to spend more time in prison."
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Latin, including some of the most dangerous charges in the country.
In June, a prisoner was told that the governor of the prison had to be treated in the hospital.
And last October, police officers were summoned to deal with a serious mob that attacked the workers in the first place.
The pink cyclist’s threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City is sudden (probability for difficult parts)
With the tropical low pressure, Arizona is unable to break down, but the next week, with its remaining strength, it is likely that this will be the case in the desert, so it is likely that it will be filled suddenly.
The National Weather Service, including West Arizona, South and East Nevada, Fire California and Utah, Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake, have just given advance notice of the arrival of Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Rose expects to head straight to Phoenix, and on Monday, it will be rainy.
In a tweet, National Weather Service in Phoenix said that only ten tropical cyclists in the area of Phoenix since 1950 have kept their situation or low pressure!
Katrina (1967) was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
According to the National Cycling Center's latest estimate, 2 to 4 will fall in the rain, and 6 will fall in the Arizona Magolonese Rim.
In other parts of the city of Desert Southwest, between 1 and 2 inches [2 cm] and in the middle of Rocky and Great Besins, it is possible to rain up to 4 inches [4 inches] in an instant.
For those who come out of the danger of sudden flooding, the rain from the dew will be beneficial because the land has suffered a famine.
Even if it is a cause for concern, a little rain can be beneficial because the southwest is facing the present state of hunger.
According to the U.S. Drot Monitor, Arizona is experiencing a low-intensity hunger, which is the second highest level," reports Weather.com.
First, the road to the Rosa cyclist will be on the coast of Mexico, California.
On Sunday, Rosa's wind was about 85 miles [7 km] long, and it was located in the southern part of Mexico, at 385 miles [12 km] and was heading north at 12 miles [12 km].
This storm has to cope with colder waters in the Pacific.
Thus, it is expected to reach Mexico on Monday afternoon or at night in the form of a tropical storm.
Since heavy rains can occur in parts of Mexico, there is a significant risk of flooding.
"Commercial California is expected to fall from 3 to 6 inches in rain, which can fall up to 10 inches," says Weather.com.
After that, Rosa will drive a tropical low - pressure band on Tuesday morning before reaching the Arizona border in northern Mexico, which will then travel from Arizona to the south of the Utah on Tuesday night.
"Rosa or its calm effect can cause heavy rains in the Southwest," said the National Cycling Center.
This rain can lead to an event that can lead to an abundance of wildlife and deserts and an abundance of rains in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four people arrested under charges of murder
Three young children and a 20 - year - old man have been arrested for attempted rape of 16 - year - olds in Sumerset.
On Saturday, about 04:00 BST appeared in the Excellence Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was described as being “stabilized. ”
One 17 - year - old, two - and - a - 20 - year - old man from the Radstock area was arrested at night, reported Sumerset Police.
If someone has a cell phone, the authorities have made a call to move on.
Trump told Kevino that he was surrounded by the ‘ selfishness, anger, and anger ’ of the Democratic Party.
"One opinion for Judge Kevino is to reject the firm and provocative behaviour of the democratic party," said Trump at a meeting in Welling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kevino was surrounded by the democratic party's "self-esteem, anger" in their entire candidacy process.
Kevino made his commitment to the Thursday convention, and when we were young, he strongly refused to commit sexual assault against Christian Blacie Ford.
Ford also confirmed his claim in the hearing.
The presidents said on Saturday that the day "Americans saw the skill and qualities and courage of Keveno."
"The opinion of Judge Kevino is that the most successful law in our time is the opinion of a judge who has the right to perform public service," they told West Virginia's supporters.
When the presidents spoke about the importance of the Republican views in the Middle Ages, they noted Kevin’s unrecognition.
The choice of one of the most important things in our life has remained for five weeks.
I don't stand, but I do stand," they said.
"That's why I'm fighting big candidates everywhere."
Trompney claimed that the democrats are on the campaign to "invent and prevent".
On the nomination of Kevino, a senior GOP leader said CNN is expected to be the first major operational opinion in the Senate until Friday.
Earthquake in Indonesia, hundreds of deaths in tsunamis, increases the number of deaths
After a major earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, at least 384 people were killed, many reportedly passed away on Saturday.
On Friday, when hundreds of people were gathered on the shore of Palu, six meters (18 feet) high stood on the shore, and many passed away, and all the roads were destroyed.
This was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the threat of tsunami arose, people were working on the shore, and they didn't leave immediately, and they fell victim," BNPB spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster agency Sutovo Nugroho told reporters at Zakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, the car, the storm, the houses were dragged into it, and she searched the ground for everything," Nugroho added, saying that the tsunami traveled 800 kph (497 mph) quickly from the open sea before landing on the shorebar.
Some people said that they would climb and read trees to read from the tsunami.
About 16700 people were taken to safety in the 24 centers in Palu.
Many buildings and shops destroyed, bridged, and ruined buildings, and a bridge was surrounded by a river.
Later, the coastal city was struck by the earthquake on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt by 2.4 million people in the area.
Indonesia's Institute of Assessment and Technology (BPPT) stated in a request that the massive earthquake of Friday's energy was more than 200 pcs in the Hiroshima World War.
It is said that the area of the town, which is on the edge of a cliff, has a long, steep slope that has led to the formation of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels have been destroyed.
They said that 540 people had been injured and 29 had been injured.
Nugroho said that the north of Palu was close to the central point of the earthquake, about 300 miles [300 km] north of Dongga.
The impression was that there was no information available from Dunggal, Nugroho said.
There were more than 300,000 people living here," Red Cross said in a request, saying that workers and volunteers are heading towards restricted areas.
"It's already a disaster, but things can get worse," he said.
The authorities reported that the incident had occurred during the warning period, although it was widely known that Palu had not been informed that the tsunami was taking place on Saturday.
In a bold statement on social media, a man who is standing on the top of a building may hear that tsunamis are warning people down the street.
Within a few minutes, a wall fell on the water’s edge, and the building and the car were moved.
This was not immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large amount of power supply to break down, causing the authorities to find it difficult to balance safety efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has begun sending Kargo from Zakarta and other cities, but the survivors need food and other basic facilities.
The city’s airport has been reopened for aid purposes only, and it will be closed until October.
The president, Joko Vidodo, will visit the relief centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia reached 800.
This is so bad.
World Vienna workers have safely arrived in Palu, where workers have set up police stations in their offices, and have seen the sights of disaster on the road, Mr. Doseva said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," they said.
This is so bad.
Some have complained that when relief teams have begun to set themselves up for disaster relief, experienced foreign helpers are being ridiculed for going to the palace.
According to Indonesia’s rules, if the place of the disaster has been declared a national disaster, only foreigners, suppliers, and workers can go there.
It has not yet happened.
"Learning this is above the level of the disaster," said Olivia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Why did the government say, "That's right, it's a national disaster," then we'll open up for international aid, but it's not yet."
When Friday’s earthquake and tsunami struck Palu the second night, friends and relatives of the homeless still hope to find their loved ones miraculously because of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was expelled from the gang.
On Sunday, the survivors released a woman who had been trapped with her mother’s body for two days.
The teachers of the Indonesian National Paragliding Association, Gandon Subandono, are two Asian paragliders trained for the competition that began this month in Indonesia.
In fact, some of the other prisoners in Roa Roa’s hotel were students.
As an elder in the paragliding area, I have my own emotional burden," they said.
Mr. Roa Roa Hotel reported that within hours of the spread of the paragliding community, they had sent Vots to the players at the Bich Festival.
However, their messages remained only one sign instead of two blue marks.
"I don't think that means they haven't reached the message," they said.
Stealers took $26,750 while cashing in ATM here in Levover Newport.
News from the Newport Police Department of Newport reported that thieves had stolen $26,750 from a copper worker on Friday morning while loading into an ATM.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said that the driver was emptying an ATM in the entertainment package and preparing for more money.
When he was busy, another man came running after the man. He ran away with a bag of money for the delivery.
The newspaper reported that the Witnesses had seen a large number of fugitives on the scene, but not many were reported by the police.
If you have any information about them, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenya West: Rapper changed his name
The Rapper Key West has changed its name.
On Saturday, when he announced this change on Twitter, he wrote: "This practice was called the Kenyan West."
In the mid - 40 ’ s, he had the name Monique for his eighth album, which was written in June.
This change has occurred before his presentation on the satellite Night Live, where he expects to begin his new album.
The singer Ariana Grande is coming to the show, which he said "for emotional reasons," by the manufacturer who left the show.
In the past, a short form of our current business name, West, stated that it is of religious importance to him.
"I think 'Come' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You,' said West when discussing his album title with Radio Host Big Boy at the beginning of the year.
So I am you, and I am you, and I am you.
This change from the key, namely, to the mere reflections of our good, our bad, our bad, and all.
This album is more a reflection of who we are."
This is one of the most popular apparitions that have changed its name.
Sine Combs was known for various names, such as Pope Dad, P.D., or Daddy, but this year we love these names as quickly as possible.
May West Adjuster, J-Zed, has also changed with or without a hyphen and a capitol.
AMLO, Mexico, swore not to use the military against citizens
Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, the candidate for the Mexican presidency, has vowed never to use the army on the back of the 50th anniversary of the bloodbath against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday, Latloko Plaza, never to use the army to rob Mexicans.
On October 2nd, 1968, soldiers marched against peacemakers, killing about 300 people, and left-wing students took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly subscriptions and to open up public schools more free of charge.
They said that because of their lack of employment and educational opportunities, young children are turning to gangs of criminals.
America should double the A.I.
As China is more active in artificial intelligence, US-based and AI-Business Key-Fu Lee have been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple to double the cost of research in this area.
The United States has no official AI protection, and this has been the reaction after various U.S. government departments have announced AI.
In the meantime, last year China launched its plan, which aims to be No. 1 in New Zealand by 2030.
"Dual AI research journal will be a good start, because all the other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking forward to the next state in AI," Lee said.
By double-off, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week would be twice the chance to achieve the next major success in the United States.
Lee's book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and The New World Order" has been published by Hututon Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of the Saynoves Venchers, a leading AI company in China in face++.
In the 1980s, they worked at the University of Carnegie Mailen on an AI system that lost the highest-ranking American Othello Player, and later they were president of an executive and the Google Chinese branch in Microsoft Research.
Defensive Research Projects mentioned earlier U.S. government technology contests, such as the Robotics Challenges of the Agency, and asked when the next competition would be to help find the following future ones.
In the United States, researchers have to work hard to obtain government funds.
"Educationists don't lose China, they take corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed students from colleges to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that the changes in immigration will also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the AI.
"I think I should automatically give green cards to the PhD in AI.
The Chinese government launched its next generation's creative wisdom plan in July 2017.
In the same way that the U.S. National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide money to researchers, China’s National Science Foundation provides people in educational institutions, but China’s educational performance is low.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a joint creative intelligence centre, where industry and education will be part of the field, and the White House announced the establishment of a select committee on creative intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion deposit in an AI-next leader.
In the case of NSF, it currently makes more money than 100 million dollars a year in AI research.
In the meantime, a U.S. law designed to create a national security measure on artificial wisdom has not been approved for many months.
The people of Macedonia decided to change the name of their country.
Macedonia's people argued on Sunday for the public about why they should change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which will lead to their decades of dialogue with Greece because Greece has banned its membership in the European Union and NATO.
There is a Macedonian country in Greece, and they insist that its neighbor's name in the north is right-wing and has been denied access to the country's NATO and EU.
The two governments made an agreement based on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that this name will make Macedonia’s Slavic multiethnic population more vulnerable.
Professor George Ivanov said that we will not vote in this state, and the expulsion campaign will have at least 50 percent of the votes required to be valid in the world.
The public's journal asks: "Are we in favour of NATO and EU membership in agreement with Greece?"
With Prime Minister Zoran Zave, the name of the change advocates claims that Macedonia is a price to pursue entry into organisations such as the EU and NATO, which is a country that is soon to come to Yugoslavia.
I'm here today to give my country's future to young Macedonians, because they can stay free under the same roof of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgiveska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, the members of the Parliament have said that we should follow this opinion to be decisive.
This name will require a two-thirds majority in the institutions.
The national election procedure stated that no irregularities had occurred until noon at 1: 00 a.m.
However, there were only 16 percent of the protests, in 2016 was 34 percent when 66 percent of the registered voters expressed their views.
I'm out to argue for my children, our place in Europe," said José Tanevski, 62-year-old in the capital, Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zave, his wife Zorika and son Dishko made a statement in the country's re-named government, Syria, and Macedonia, which will open the door to entry into NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kvardarkov, a 54 - year - old housewife, is making a small workshop in front of the concentration camps.
We're on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to take part, not at the back door," said Kvardarkov.
We have a poor land, but we have a poor land.
If they don't want us to join Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia Alliance."
Prime Minister Zave said NATO membership will bring much-needed competition in Macedonia, as there is more than 20 percent of the unemployment rate.
"I think a lot of people will support because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supporters of the EU and NATO," Zawa said after arguing.
They said, "Yes," if it's out, it'll be "Affirmation of our future."
On Monday, a statement published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research stated that 30 to 43 percent of government officials will participate — this is less than the required amount.
On Sunday, 57 percent of the people were planning to protest against another gene test performed by Telma TV in Macedonia.
Of these, 70 percent said that they would argue.
In order for this government to succeed, 50 percent more will have to be done.
If this government fails last May, it will be the first major challenge to the Western government's policy.
See: Sirgio Aguiron, of the capital’s capital, traveled from the British Coast to the rest of the world
Sergio Aguiro and Rehim Sterling won the 2-0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday, Manchester, England, at the British Protection Stadium.
Aguiron’s goal was 65 minutes away.
This was a visit to the Argentine Stiquer and early in the midfield.
He ran from three British defenders before going into the open field.
After that, Aguiro was surrounded by four green shirts.
He threw a bomb around a defender and then knocked on the door of the British box.
Then he turned to his left side, where he had become a starling starling.
In the box, the English Forwarder rescinded the ball with his first touch, and he shot at the right side of the net, using the right boot, with the British Cup of Matthew Rayan.
There are some problems at the foot of Agvero," the city manager told the reporters.
"That's 55, 60 minutes.
That is exactly what happened.
It's our pleasure that he shot at the moment."
However, Skye Bluzana won the first prize in the battle of Sterling Prime Minister League.
This was the 29th minute of the round.
At that time, Agvero found a ball inside Britain.
He sent a beautiful ball to Léroy Sen on his left.
Sene took some toxins and then headed for the post office from far away.
The Skye Blue Forward tapped into the ball net just before crossing the border.
In Germany, at 12:55 p.m. in Rhine-Neker-Arina, the champions will join the city's war with Hofnheim in the German league.
Sherzer wants to play the dice against Rocky.
Since the Nationals were out of the league, there was little reason to start a new force.
But for all eternity, fair Sherzerna is expected to be challenged on Sunday against Colorado Rocky, but in the Netherlands, it would still be useful to play the string for a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rocky Friday night won 5-2 victory over the Nationals, but they still expect to fight for their first device book.
"Even if we don't play for anything, knowing that the environment in the den is going to survive, we're going to be able to follow the minimum ranger, and the second team is going to play at a high level that I haven't been through this year.
Why don't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals are not yet announced as a starter for Sunday, but they may be ready to let Sherzer come on such a occasion.
Sherzer, who is about to begin his 34th birthday, took a nap on Thursday, and he will keep an eye on the Sunday.
This Washington Wright-Hander is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 220 2/3 inches have 300 strikeouts.
Meeting in West Virginia
The presidents pointed out the importance of the presence of the Republics during the Middle Ages elections and pointed out the situation surrounding Brett Keveno, elected by the Supreme Court.
What we have done is what we ought to have done in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our life.
This is one of the biggest — I’m not fighting, but I’m fighting because I’m going everywhere for the big candidates.
Trump went on to say, "Look at this horrible, horrible group of democrats, you see it all happening now.
And they have determined to regain power in any way they need, see this selfishness, this loyalty.
They don't want whom we hurt, they don't want us to step in to get power and control, so they want power and control, we don't give them it."
They said the Democrats are on the campaign to "resistance and resistance".
And you've seen it for the last four days," they said, Democrats called "sense and selfish and selfish and liars."
The Sinet Judicial Committee referred to the fact that the Democratic Senator Dean Einstein was credited with being named after him, and he was distinguished from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you opened a document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one -- she was saying a really bad body -- I've been saying the worst body I've ever seen."
Leber is no longer a Broad Church.
He does not tolerate what is said in his heart
It was no wonder that when the officials on my side of the Momentum thought I was guilty.
Finally, I am the most refreshing Leber MP who has been told not to welcome us — just about what we have been saying.
My fellow civil servants, John Rayan, did the same because she had taken a firm stand against June’s hatred.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
Sadly, because of the importance of a responsible financial crisis on national security in Europe, they are the same issues that were at odds with former leaders of Jeremy.
At the meeting of Nottingham East Leber on Friday, he asked: "We want to be inclusive and productive in meetings."
Most of my eight - year - olds were like the GC meetings of Friday night.
Unfortunately today, there is no such environment in many meetings and "more kind, pure," the word of politics has ever been forgotten if it really started.
It is clear from this increase that the opposing opinion is not tolerated on the part of the Leber, and each opinion is based on whether it is acceptable to the leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because I would turn around and pretend that I would never accept a role otherwise -- whether it's national security or the EU Single Market.
When I speak in public — and I don’t really care what I say — the social media has a bad idea that I should cancel my election, ban the politics of the center, and I should not be at the Leber Party.
And that’s not all I’ve ever had.
Indeed, I am more noble than some of my fellow workers, because my reactions to me are political.
I am amazed at the practical and firm nature of friends who do not let their daily sexual or illiteracy daunt them.
This is the most disappointing topic of the political age — the common thread of contradictions.
In the past week, Jeremy Corbin expressed the view that the employee should adjust the culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer so generous that any "unbelieve" proposal or election rules will make the party miserable.
With the request that I lay my head down and not speak again, I had enough advice in the past two years, that it might be well with me.
But I didn’t come into politics.
As a result of the insecurity of the Thacher government, I have been disabled and have been a 32 - year - old school student since I joined the workforce, as a local city servant, or as a government minister, asked for better public service provisions for those in need.
I never hid my politics with my previous elections.
No one in the Nottingham East can be confused about the state of my defenses and the current leadership in the area of disagreement.
On Friday, I want to tell everyone who supported this proposal so much that I can't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to my employer.
But whether they are members of my governing body or not, I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that I cannot let the threats or political practices of any kind distract me from my work, which I consider to be in your behalf.
Chris Leslie Nottingham is an MP from the East.
Ir 38 - 17 Melrosh: Unprecedented Airs Reached the Top
The two triangulations that have been performed have had some adverse effects on the final outcome, but there is no doubt that this match in the Air Wonder-Monorangic Tenents Premiership is due to victory throughout the day.
They are now the top of the table, the only uninhabited organization in the ten nations.
Finally, like the fine ability to afford, their survival was beautiful, which gave the local organization and coach Peter Marty the full right to enjoy.
"I'm glad we've been so tested for our game, and we're still unaccompanied," he said.
Robin of Melrose said, "It's worth it, they've taken advantage of the opportunity better than we have."
Frazier Klimodwara's 14th-minute Trio of Grant Anderson's return to the Air Force, but a card released by Scotland Cape Rory Hughes made it possible to score Melroz and Jason Bagt took a false trio.
Klimo was able to get an Irish landing with a penultimate half-time before, and then, during the break, he turned the Irish 17-5 to get an Irish landing on a single deck.
But Melrose did start well in the other direction, and Patrick Anderson's trolley turned the bag into a five-point radius.
Then, a serious tragedy caused by Ruerich Nott stopped playing for a long time, which was taken from the stretcher, and from the very beginning, the air staphord McDowell’s air - conditioned air - conditioning station moved further.
The Air's Hungry Crusader, Blair McFerson, was later given a follow-up card, and once again, Melroge finally took advantage of an unchanging Bruce Colvin's three extra players.
Later, the local organization returned, but, while counting the Bolvina Klimola from the Penalty Line-out, Stroan Hchinson was given a card and the next Irishman, Macferson, gave it back to his mother.
After receiving the box of David Armstrong, Kyle Rowe and sending Flanders to Henry for the fifth trio of the local organization, Climo changed him, just as he did at the beginning.
The Steel Game Star Hotel is attempting to make its way into the industry.
After learning that Steel Game Starford Kirnon has been appointed manager of the licensed restaurant company, he took the initiative to return to the reception tomorrow.
These 56 - year - olds have played a part in the popular BBC show, Jack Jarvis, whose writings they wrote and who have been associated with the long - term Vinody partisan Greg Hemphel.
This couple have announced that the new owner of this coming show will be the last one, and is planning his life after the work at Kirnan Creegelang.
According to the official record listing, they are managers of adfriftmorn limited.
Although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kirnon Glasgow would be involved in the restaurant business, he also refused to comment on the issue.
'The sea is ours: the hope of the land of Bolivia to open the way to the Pacific.
In the past, Rigging-Claude in La Paz is being held at the headquarters of Nosene.
The sky’s beams of color fall on public buildings.
The following sermon is written down to the foot of the Amazon: "We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to get him."
In the whole of Bolivia, the memory of Chile's loss of blood from 19th-century resources in the conflict with Chile is still alive today -- as if there is still hope to sail in the Pacific.
That hope may be the highest in this decade because Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has speed, unity and courage, and, of course, expects a positive result from inefficiency," said Bolivia's ambassador to Roberto Cazedi.
Many Bolivians will see ice on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Heg court will judge Bolivia – after decades of rising-out speech – for Chile has agreed to share ownership of Bolivia's sea.
The attractiveness of Bolivia's local president, Ivo Morales – who is facing a fight for elections again next year – also depends largely on Monday's verdict.
At the end of August, they promised, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific."
According to some analysts, however, it is unlikely that the court will be removed on Bolivia’s side — and even if that happens, the situation will not change much.
The Netherlands-United Nations has no authority to grant the land to Chile, and they have agreed that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
Only six months after the election of the ICJ, the last debate indicated that the process was "not of unity," international law experts in Chile said.
And for Bolivia’s sake, the past four years have been postponed.
"The current Bolivian administration of the maritime route has been kidnapped," the sources said.
The morale of Morales has brought to an end the dignity of the rest of Chile.
In time, Bolivia and Chile will begin their conversation, but after that, it will be very difficult.
Since 1962, both countries have not been able to change their government.
Hega's Bolivian representatives, my president Edward Rodríguez Wells, have taken the view that the court’s decision is unusually moving.
"There will be a wonderful opportunity to start a new century of relations with Chile for Bolivia on Monday," they said, "and there will be an opportunity to complete the 139 years of disunity with each other," they said.
Morales is still the most popular leaders in Latin America, and Calzodi rejected it and said: “They used the sea as a political hub.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right to pursue the path of the Pacific ass," they said.
"This is an opportunity to see what we have to deal with before."
North Korea said that unless they trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Rey Yongho, said that if his country did not trust Washington, he would never be the first to unarm his atoms.
In the first century C.E., the apostle Paul wrote: “The word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two - edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints and their marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart. ”
They called for the observance of the promises made by the United Nations during the meeting in Singapore, in the Protestant Republic of the Congo.
Their opinion is when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeii, North Singapore, Kim Jong, and they were on their way to resume the innovative policies that had been undermined more than three months later.
Rey said it's a "vision" that kept the U.S.'s perspectives for a ban on such an advert, which will end the Korean war and bring North Korea to its knees.
By the end of the 20th century, the United States had become the world’s largest city in the world, and the United States had become the world’s largest city.

But Pyongyang is very sure of being serious about leaving his book because it is only a safe haven for his protection.
In the following month, Pyongyang is scheduled to attend the second meeting of the Pompio Kim-Trup.
In the fashion show in Paris, a large new category was presented to reach your neighbor’s main street.
If you want to grow or if you want to protect yourself from the sun, don’t look at it.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brownie presented a range of large-scale covers for their SS19 collections, which resulted in a style of selling the Paris fashion road.
In the latter case, these highly impractical hats were placed on the scale and sent by these designers to their audiences for Katwak.
Valentine’s Day Pants was an over-the-top pinging hat that had been decorated with a wide, thick stick that decorated the models’ heads.
Other sized tools included necklaces decorated with precious stones, a magic hat, and even a fake – but they were not designed to keep your head up.
Thomas Browny also presented a category of these remarkable faces -- and they were in Halloween.
Many colored faces were touched by the lips of the faces, and they looked more like the weakest fibers.
One design was like a Skyba Diving Gear, which contained serpents and Googles, and the other looked like a distorted ice cream cone.
And if you could use this huge fashion statement, you'd be great.
Those who observed these styles thought that they could be found on the main road you are approaching.
The super-sized hats appeared on the tops of 'Llonga', the two-foot long rod, the straight hats, the Rihana they appeared on the heads of all of them.
This very impractical hatsmack which was named on the social media, was sent to another large design catwalk -- a strawbag, like the cute young model that took the kid.
Raffia Zallerporta was the best part of the collection, which had a white leather handle in the upper part of the Raffia Raffia Bag Paris Fashion.
Famous Stylist Luke Armitez told Fimel: 'I was expecting big hats and bags to come on the main road for them next – the designers had such a huge impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for this super-sized device.'
John Edward: Language skills are needed for the world’s citizens
Scotland's free school holds a success in educational advancement, and this is also taking place in 2018, which includes another set of extraordinary test results, which only attracts personal and collective success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, the Scottish quill of Independent Schools (SCIS) is being represented at the door, training students and parents to give the best of their service.
Free schools set the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, for their chosen career, and for their place as a world citizen.
As a field of education that can design and implement the predestined school curriculum, modern languages are known to be a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandell said, "If you speak to someone who understands him, he'll just go to his head.
"If you speak to anyone who is in a language that he understands, it will be more tolerable in his heart.
Remembering this is one of the most important things that we cannot rely on English to establish relationships and faith with people in other countries.
As a result of the recent tests on the fight, we can see that language at League Tables is the highest position in high school, with higher education rates.
A high degree of education was obtained by 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language.
The data collected by the SCS 74 school members show that 72 percent of students in Mandarin received a high grade A, if only 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students who received an A grade.
This shows that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills, which will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
As a subject of choice, the language is now understood as a subject of study of free schools and other subjects such as STEM (scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematics).
In the 2014 survey of journalists and professionals, Uke had found that 17 percent of all language skills were less responsible for the reasons given by Niotandwara to fill an empty space.
As a result, more and more language skills are being developed to prepare the young class for their future work.
These skills have become necessary in this world of globalisation, along with the opportunities for more jobs that are needed in the language.
If they have learned another language, they can have a real benefit in the future because they have the same skills in life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad will make it possible for people who speak multilingual themselves to compete.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults in Yuké, 75 percent of people in 2013 were unable to speak a foreign language in a language that could be spoken only in French, or 15 percent.
This is why today’s children’s language education is important.
If there are many languages, especially developing economies, children will be given an opportunity to obtain meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Many schools focus more on modern languages than they do on other languages that are considered the most important for Uuk to look forward to by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Even if your child is interested in anything, he or she has a variety of languages to choose from, and he or she is also a teacher in related fields.
The Scottish Free Schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare students and whatever the future may bring them, as well as skills to succeed.
A global business cannot at this time deny that language is essential for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages need to be considered as "International Dialogue Skills".
For young people in Scotland, free school will continue to provide this choice, variety, and excellence.

Lebron San Diego is to be sacrificed by Sunday Lakes
The prospect of seeing Lebron James in the first match for the Los Angeles Lakes has come to an end.
Luke Walton, a teacher of the Lexes, announced that James San Diego was going to play against the Daver Nuggets in the early morning of Sunday’s festival.
However, he still needs to decide how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lukers' official website.
Luke’s reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After Sarah's first week of the week, James Lechers was asked about his plans for the six-game season.
He said, "There's no need to prepare me at this stage of my work," he said.
Time on the train in Trompe, West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Today, President Donald Trump began his training at the train station in Welling, West Virginia.
This was the first of five train stations scheduled for the next week, waiting for them to arrive in their suitable positions with Tennessee and Mississippi.
In order to fill an empty space in the Supreme Court, a strong opinion on his election is being held to support the mid-term elections coming to the Tromp, as the Republicansa Congress is afraid to lose control when it comes to protesting in November.
How long does the train in West Virginia last night, and how can you watch it online?
Tromp's sailing is defined at 7 p.m. on train in West Virginia. Ett today night, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the live stream gate online on train YouTube, West Virginia.
Tromps may refer to the hearing for Bret Caven this week, a person designated by the Supreme Court, who has been subjected to sexual abuse charges and who has been detained for a week by the Senate for an expected FBI investigation.
However, the main purpose of the rally is to help the Republicans to make some progress in the elections in November.
Thus, Trump's preaching said that this next week's five relays aim is "to protect and enhance the dignity of the Republican Senate and the House of Representatives, by trying to increase it, to fill in the enthusiasm of volunteers and supporters," says Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for their work list that, as we move forward in this busy preaching season, the presidents will travel to as many states as possible," the minister of Trump informed Reuters without saying his name.
The Night's Rail, established for Wesbank for Erina at Willing, "can bring substantial support from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from Pittsburgh," West Virginia Metro News said.
A second visit to West Virginia in a month, from which they won more than 40 percent in 2016.
In the Troms elections, West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisi is trying to help.
"This is not a good sign for Moriscos that the presidents need to come to help him in these elections," said political scientists at West Virginia University, Simon Header.
Reader Cup 2018: The United States has shown a strong desire to keep such a fight alive while going to the Union Singles.
After three unique sessions, the Saturday afternoon window showed the reader who wanted the cut.
The twins of the Helkave are an idea that is completely found in the games, but it is one that is completely believed in the gamers, and is never more than a match.
How can we be sure that Jehovah will help us to cope with our problems?
"They had six scores, and now they're four, so I think we're getting some speed now," Jordan Spith said when he finally left.
Europe is in a better position, with four points ahead, and 12 more in the game.
Americansa, Spitt says that if there's little wind in the way of their tails, and they have a lot to encourage, not just because of Spitt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three out of four.
From Sputum T. to Green, his leadership is exemplary.
When he and Thomas were two after each other, all four of the four squares were edited in an important format.
And when he was about 15 years old, his neck was made bald, and his neck was made bald, because he knew that he believed that the Americans were still in competition.
"You really need to do a lot more and worry about your own face," Spitt said.
Each of these games is about the rest of the game.
There are 18 holes to make a mark.
In the past two days, players more than Spitt and Thomas were only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who claimed to be the driver’s cup.
But the attractive couple found four of them, and there was no error in them.
"Molywood" was the only couple who couldn't shoot a boogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Friday morning boogies on Friday afternoon, and supported Nuu on Friday morning.
He thought that the crowd behind him, and the crowd behind him, that they were just losing the gamers on Sundays, and that no one would be as popular there as the Sun on Le Golf National as Flatwood and Molinarian, except for a possible European victory.
There are two different holes at the same time — more than one.
However, the story of European dignity came to an abrupt end.
Bobba Watson and Web Simpson reduced the work of Sergio García, who became the hero of the morning Forbols, when he was married to Alex Norren.
A bogie and two double - obtained Spanish and Swedish on the front nine could never reach the nearest of a hall.
On Sunday, if there were no one to help you out of your living room.
Because of the closeness of Forbols and Forsams, the couple had a good conversation, advice they gave, advice they did not give, and a strategy that could change in time.
As an organization, Europe has played a good role, and the final day of the year has been a significant shock, but at the same time, the U.S. team showed a war attitude, especially at the stateside, where there was doubt.
Europe captured 10-6 on the last day of the Reader Cup.
After coming out of the Forbals and Forsams on Saturdays, Europe will gain a strong edge on the United States, with 10-6 hits on the final day of the Reader Cup.
Tommy Flitwood and Francisco Molinari, an inspired couple who fought against the Tiger Woods, led the struggle with two victories and led their scores on the Le Golf National.
Two years ago, Thomas Jørne, who was defeated in Hezeltain, won a 3-1 victory over the American Powers in the early Forbals.
In the Forsams, Europe was more opposed and won in front of Dr.
In order to keep Jim Farchi’s organization alive, eight of the Sunday’s 12 - to - day fronts were required.
Flitwood is the first European player who won four scores in a row, but he and Molinari, who were called "Molywood", were the only couple who won all four of their initial competitions in the history of the Ryder Cup after a thrilling week.
After ravaged by Woods and Patrick Reed in Forbols, more than 5 and 4 players scored the most depressed Woods and Brian Desboule in the United States.
On Saturday, two combatants, drawn by two combatants, showed a slight lack of excellence, but he was now defeated in 19 and seven in 29 of his fights in Forbals and Forsam.
Justin’s day of rest in the morning, along with his wife, Henry Stanson, returned to Forssams and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, one and three of them worldwide.
Nothing happened to Europe on the day it was a sunny and airy day in South-West Paris.
Three - hour champions, Jordan Spithe and Justin Thomas, set standards for the Americans on Saturday.
In Forbols, they won a victory over John Ramm and Ian Polter in Spain and then returned to Forsams after losing two holes in the beginning, defeating Polter and Rory McLarroy in 4th.
Although it is only a matter of deciding whether to keep a member of the pre-victory firefighting organization, there have been two times in the history of the reader cup when an organization went to sings.
And it came to pass, after two days and two days, that the plague was as if they had been without the gate on the sabbath day.
North Korea refused "any way" to become a unilateral weapon without confidence
Foreign Ministers of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that constant restrictions were on the United States, and in such a situation, the country would not abandon the monsters in any way.
Rei Yong said at the annual general meeting of the World Organization that North Korea had made "a remarkable move last year," such as stopping nuclear and nuclear testing, destroying nuclear testing sites and not increasing nuclear and nuclear technology.
"However, we haven't found any related responses from the U.S.," they said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., we will not have confidence in our national security, and in such a situation we will not individually unarm ourselves first."
Where the "step by step" of stopping Rhini's invention reinvigorated the constant complaints of North Korea that North Korea would be forced to move slowly, their statement is remarkable, in which Pyongyang did not refuse to shut down one-sided invention, as it had been earlier.
The first meeting between the President of the United States and the leaders of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, Kim Jong and Donald Trump continued to refer to the joint statement, promising Kim to work in the direction of "stopping the invention of the Korean island", but Trump assured North Korea's protection.
North Korea is demanding the formal end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first leave its atoms.
In addition, Washington has resisted the urge to withdraw from the harsh international restrictions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. is the first to insist "on closing the animation" and forcelessly is increasing the pressure of the barrier to achieve their goal and is also reluctant to declare "the end of the war," Rei said.
"The idea that faces will bring us to our knees will be one of the ideas of those who have no knowledge of us.
But the problem is that constant restrictions are destroying our trust."
Rey didn't mention any plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leaders had mentioned at the beginning of this week in the United Nations.
Instead, ministers highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leaders between the five months ago and Mun Jain and said: "South Korea would have been a party to the closure problem and if it hadn't been for the U.S., there would have been no reason to stop the construction of the Korean island."
However, it was not uncommon to speak to the Sun of Rei last year, when they spoke to the U.N... It was impossible to target the main part of the U.S.S., when "M. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "Rocket Man" who was on the goal of suicide.
In the United Nations this year, the troops that threatened North Korea to "completely destroy" last year, they commended Kim for her efforts to unarm their courage, but said that there was still much work to be done and that bans should continue until North Korea's creativity is stopped.
On Wednesday, Trump said that they had no window of time, saying, "If it took two years, three years, or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued about this in the U.N..
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompio U.N. said on Thursday in the Security Act: "The implementation of the security restrictions must continue to be strictly and definitely continued until the end of the anaesthesia is over."
Security has been banned in North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the provision of bans on pyongyang and explosive landfill programs.
Pompio went out to meet Rei, and said in the general sitting, "They're going to go back to the Pyongyang to prepare for another meeting in the following month.
Pompeii has already visited North Korea three times, but her final visit was not a good one.
In July, they left Pyongyang, which is why they're making progress, only in North Korea, in a few hours' time they're "asking" for it.
In May, North Korea promised that if United States plans to do so, they would destroy the site of the earthquake as well as the nuclear power plant."
They said Kim told them that the "related plans" they wanted, the Trump, would take steps to share the security promise in Singapore with Hami and Washington.
Harvard’s students are doing a lot of rest.
Harvard University is launching a new study to take more sleep for all its senior students this year in order to cope with the growing male culture through the "staying up all night" service.
One scholar found that he was generally unaware of the basic information about how to care for a number of students in the world.
Professors of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and a specialist at the University of Women’s Hospital, Charles Chizler, have developed a study that is considered to be the first in the U.S.A.
When they were out of sleep, they were moved to begin the study by explaining the results of their study.
At the end of the day came a damsel unto me, saying, Why have I been told this thing now, when I am in the last year?
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleeping — who I admire," they told The Telegraph.
This year’s first study explains how students need good sleep habits to improve their performance and their general health.
Professor of Mental Health at Harvard Medical School and University Health Officer Paul Bereira said that after a week of serious sleep deprivation, the student decided to start the study.
In this one hour’s study program, the goal is to set reasonable goals.
One area features a dorm room with students taking coffee, and the effects of caffeine and light and lack of sleep, as well as cartoons, coaches, and books that highlight the importance of sleeping time.
In the other part, participants are told how long sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Later, the map of Campus with a conversational aicons moves the participants to reflect on their program.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," said Professor Chizler.
There's still a culture of 'getting up all night' of pride, they said, it's a growing problem of modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students.
To ensure a good quality, a student must have a secret weapon to overcome the stress, fatigue, and anxiety — even to avoid weight gain — because if he loses sleep, he is hungry and hungry.
Professor Chizler, 19-year-old Raymond Gold, who learned chemical and physical biology, helped design the study, which they had studied during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said that the study program opened his eyes and moved him to go to the campus.
He hopes that at the next stage, all of these students will be told that they will have to complete such a study before entering a competitive organization.
Professor Chizler recommended that students should be alerted to go to sleep and also to get up, and that the electronic screens and the LED lighthouse should be vigilant about the harmful effects of the blue light, which will spread the lens of your body's clock, causing sleep problems.
LIVINGTON 1 - 0 Rangers: On Monday’s Day, the Gérard’s organization showed honor
Rangers took another stand, when Dolly Manga's striker beat 1-0 of Steven Garard's open association in Livingston.
In search of their first victory after the victory of 4-1 in St. Johnston, ibrox, they were in search of their first victory, but Garry Holt's organization won only a second victory in 18 games, which left their association with Ladbrox Primeship away from eight hearts.
On Monday, it was seven and a half minutes ago, and it was never seen that the Rangers' Association was trying together.
Since the Rangers are now in sixth place, the third position of Livingston is only behind the hibernian on the bullet.
And there may be other problems for the rangers because one object was thrown from the other to the other because of the damage to the head of Linson Calm Spain.
Gerard changed his organization to eight, who rejected Mother's changes in Betfried's cup of tea.
On the other hand, Holt, who played with the 11 Levies, who had received a number from the Hearts last week, and he must have been very pleased with the way in which their opponents played their best moves.
Even though the Rangers had more control of the chandeliers, Livingston used the chandeliers more than they had.
They could only have scored in two minutes when the first-time Le-of-Angreeger shot Scott Pittman but Midfielder took away his big chance.
Kigen Jacobs, on the Deep, sent Free-Kick to Craig Holket, but his defensive partner, Allen Lithgo, came to the back post.
The Rangers won control, but their game in the last string showed a lack of self-confidence.
Alfredo Morlos, who was arrested by him and Stephen Lollez, felt strongly that the quartet was supposed to have a panel on Mark, but reference to Stephen Thompson crushed Colombian’s appeal.
Rangers were only shot at two fort-haf shots on the target, but the May Brooks Shooter, who was captured by Lasana Colibelli's head and Ovi Izaria's unmanned strike were not very hard to block.
The 34th minute was the first round against the flow of the game, but no one thought that they had won the game.
Failed to replace the Jacobs setup page on the Rangers Dpp.
After D.C. Gallagher gave Chandu Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield did not respond to any of the responses that he calmly chose to complete the brain.
Garardt called Kalibeli at the scene of Ryan Kent in the break, and quickly saw the results of the change. Morlos passed by on the Hungarian side but came from his line to block the violent player.
However, Litgo and Holkat hit a long ball in the back, while Livingston kept playing the guest in their favorite manner.
In the latter state, Halt’s headlights could have increased, but McGregor stood firm until he came from a remote corner of Litgo.
The other player, Glenn Midleton, who replaced the Rangers, called Jacobs on the floor with a second one for the panel, but Thompson no longer paid attention to it.
Almanac: Seeker of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sande Morninging" in Almanac -- 136 years ago today, 30 September 1882, and beyond -- was born today in Germany by physicist Jonas William Hans Geger.
It was a search that developed a method to find and measure chiropractors, leading to a search for the Geiger counter.
Since then, in the main stream of science, Gregor Conter has also become the pop singer of the main stream, such as Roy Rogers and Del Evans in the 1950's "Bales of Coronado" film, which shows scientists like cowboys:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "This is a Google counter, which is used to look for urenium-like cartilage.
When you put this on the phone, you can hear the sound of engines coming out of the sky."
Evans: "It's pop now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was only a few days old at his 63rd birthday.
However, their search for God’s name died.
The new LAS system on cancer will teach you to 'get up' with the wrong side
The new LAS on cancer will teach them to "get up" and kill them.
As part of laxative therapy, the immune system teaches wicked individuals
This method removes the disease - resistant tissue in patients and converts it into a hospital
They can then get the common protein in many cancer patients and then get re-educated in the body
This test shows the positive effects of L.A. in patients with various cancers.
After treating a woman’s immune system with this vaccine that teaches disease control, her mortality rate has been lost for more than 18 months.
In this way, the pathogens in the patients are removed and replaced in the hospital so that they can "powder" protein commonly found in many cancer patients and are then re-educated into the body.
In Bethesda, Maryland, U.S. National Caser Institute professor Burzowski said: "We have a very hopeful outcome."
HER2 "is the cause of many types of cancers," in which Professor Burzofski explained that they include colon, dembrillation, phufus, and colorectal cancers.
Similarly, in a way, it is useful to remove the pathogens from the patients and to provide them with a "training" in a way that helps them to tackle cancer.
After being present in his SNL, Kenny West had a MAGA hat and he hit the front of the trumpet.
He doesn't like it
After the display of the Kenyan West, in which they praised the U.S. president Donald Trump and told him to fight in 2020, people flew into the studio during their satart nightlife.
At night, after singing the third song, their host town, in which they have placed the Mac Great Cap, began to oppose the democrats and announced their support to the trumpets.
"How many times have I spoken to a prostitute, saying, 'How do you like the trumpet? Are they descendants?'
If I were concerned about the tribe, I would have left the United States a long time ago," they said.
SNL began the show with the role of Matt Demon, in which the Hollywood Star had blown the doorbell of the British Cone’s witness to the charges of a sexual assault by Christine Blassie Ford.
Even though it has not been spread, West India’s football team, artist Chris Rock, uploaded to social media.
It was not yet clear whether the West was trying to blow up the post office of the Rock.
He also complained to the audience that his hat on his head had caused him to suffer from the backbone.
"They've been staring at me behind my back.
They said, 'Don't put that hat on your back.'
They hugged me!
And then they said, "I'm drowning," they said, "the Washington Examner gave the report.
West said, "You've seen the buried place?" So they said, "I'll wear my Superman cap, because you can't tell me what to do with it.
Love and see."
His comments were heard at least twice, and SNEEL’s cast members seemed to be suffering, many of them said, one of them said to the publication: “The whole studio has spread the peace of death.”
In time, West was brought to the site of Ariana Grand, whose magic loved one, Rapper Mac Miler’s death a few days earlier.
The West presented I Love It at the door of the parlor bottle and confused many.
Westla TPUSA was supported by Kandaz Turner, who tweeted: "Thank you for all the courage to stand up for the crowd."
But the organizer of the Tok Show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West was just "just like it was and it's amazing."
"But I will not reward anyone who conducts such a harmful thought to my community or who spreads it (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art").

And we are free, too," she said.

Game of Thrones Star Kitt Harrington attacked the venomous man
Kitt Harrington is known for his role in the role of HBIO’s violent medieval intellectual owner, Game of Throne.
But the 31 - year - old teacher criticized the man’s honesty, saying that such roles on the screen often require a lack of respect for young ones.
Speaking to Sunday Times, Kit said he believed in 'something wrong' as well as asked how to deal with the problem of poison in #MeToo.
Recently, his teammate of the Game of Thrones, 31-year-old Rose Lesley, admits that he wants to get rid of the problem 'very powerful'.
'I think it's very strong for a person at the moment -- what did you do about your men?' they said.
'What are we teaching them about the problem we are seeing when people are growing up?'
Kitt believes that because of the enormous amounts of manpower on television, he's responsible for some of the growth in the poisonous humanity.
They say, 'What is born, and what is taught?
Do they feel that young people should have a particular side to become men because of what they are taught on television and on the streets?
I think that this is one of the greatest questions of our time. How should we change it?
For there hath been a certain evil done to the young children.
He admitted in an interview that after the next game of the throne was over, he wouldn't be able to ride or cycle it, and he'd hit the horse and the horse.
Since November, Kitt Sam Shepherd has been working in the Rejuvenation of the True Shepherd of the West, a filmmaker and his brother who is a thief.

'Because I met my wife at this show, he gave me my future family and the next life,' they said.
Ami Avard-victor of the fictional owner of the kite had a role to play in John Snow's performance.
The couple married in June 2018 on the family property field in Scotland, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New cases in China increased by 14%
In the United States, about 14 percent of the people with HIV and AIDS in China have been reported to have been infected with HIV.
Health officials have said that there are more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most people in the new cell have been infected with convulsions, which show a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spreading rapidly through some parts of China.
However, the Chinese health authorities reported that the number of people infected with HIV had fallen to about zero in the Greek population.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS addicts in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection is a major problem in the LGBT community in China.
In China, homosexuality has not been a crime by law since 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT population has grown.
The study concluded that according to the country’s academic values, 70 to 90 percent of men marry women.
In the United States, the number of people infected by AIDS is estimated to be more than half of the world’s population.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged the global availability of HIV drugs as part of its problem management effort.
Maxine Waters declared that the worker had failed to break the data of the GPS sensor and that it was 'dangerous lies' and 'engine principles'.
On Saturday, the U.S. Republican Maxin Waters, one of her employees, denounced the three U.S. Republican pages of the Constitution for posting personal information to the Senator.
Los Angeles Democrat strongly stated that the defendants were inspired by the slogans and websites of the "Earth-Right Group".
"False, lying, and more hateful lies," the Waters said in a statement on their Twitter.
According to information published by the U.S. Senators, Linds Graham and Mike Lee and Orin Hach had residence letters and phone numbers from South Carolina.
On the Capitol Hill, an unknown isma appeared online during the hearing of the Sinnet Panel on Sexual Misbehaviour Charges by the Supreme Court.
After examining the three sintered cemeteries, she disappeared.
According to poets such as the Gatewe Pandite and Redstate, the IP card that identifies the source of the post was linked to the Waters office, and a water worker showed the information, reports The Hill.
"These innocent accusations are completely wrong and are false on the run," the Waters went on.
"A member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations -- is not responsible for breaking this information in any way.
These innocent accusations are completely wrong and are false in the defenses."
The Waters spoke quickly online, including the press release of the White House’s press secretary, Ari Flesser.
"This denial is small," the flasher writes.
"It shows that she's not eligible to be a member of Congress.
When they are accused of anything that they have not done, they are not worthy to be angry.
They were not to be distracted.
They do not question the motives of the accused.
They must be quiet and at ease."
The response of the glass waters was compared to the criticism of the judge of the Democratics, who had been accused of being very angry during the teacher’s hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Novaro, who will stand up to the victors in the Middle Ages, also put their thoughts on Twitter.
"If true, it's a very big thing," they tweeted.
In his statement, the Waters said his office "has indicated to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false claims.
"We will ensure that criminals will be opened," they added, "and they will be legally held responsible for all such acts as destroyers and my work force or any of my members."
John English Strikes Aghen Review - Lowly Effective Rowan Atkinson's Secret Dumb
In any new film, British art has now become a tradition to get the results of the Brexit, and this is also true of Johnny English Action-Comedy Vidmbin French - which began in 2003 as Johnny English and was re-lived as Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Would we be happy to have a self-esteem on how worthless we are as a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, Johnny English has a second renewal of the disability of his face -- his name suggests that he has a great comical design for those who watch English movies.
He is certainly a stupid secret agent who, despite glamorous glamorous glamorous glory, feels a little like Mr. Bink Klauso (Student Police) and gives a note to the London Olympics Open House, 2012, that man's team is contributing to the dust of the character of the Fire Theme.
That fitting Atkinson once forgot the Barclaycard TV advertisements are based on the passenger and the intruder of the international human being and adds to his confusion.
This latest movie also has one or two great moments.
I would like to go to the chopper with John’s medieval clothes on, and his legs would be broken and his head would be broken.
Atkins' gift of the body vinoda appears, however, Vinnod seems to be very poorly effective and especially 007 and the "serious" film brands, which are now a reliable component of the vinoda as part of the mission.
Winnod doesn't seem like a plan for young children, and I didn't think of Johnny England as being as imaginary and focused as the windmills in the Atkinson oral picture.
Now the general foundation of the subject is the Great Britain’s serious problem.
A cyber-hacker in Britain enters the super-secret web network of secrets and discovers all of Britain's agents, which makes the agent amazed at the job - a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
There's the last hope for the Ugaritics and the rebels and their political popularity: Emma Thompson has made a lot of money like yours, but she can't do anything else.
Her secret counselors suggest that each of her active secrets should be revealed and brought to her by someone she has lost.
And this means that stupid Johnny English, who is currently acting as a school teacher in the state of Elishana, is teaching lessons about how to become a secret operative: there are some great Vinnodi situations here because English school is made up of a rock-type hierarchy.
In a hurry, England is again invited to the Whitehall for an early briefing and is once again visited by his long - term associate, Bell Miler.
Bo is now married, he married a submarine commander, Jolly-Hocky-Sticks Roll, where he has developed the ability to perform as well as Wiki Paperdine.
In each Magistrate’s secret service, those who make terrible mistakes come to Batman and Robin, face the beautiful woman of Olga Kirilenko, who lives in the city of Ophelia Boulevard.
Meanwhile, Krysmai, who claims to be able to solve the problems of the British computer, is under the dangerous influence of the millions of people: the terrible Jason Walta, who has been hit by Jack Lassin.
The English and Bo begin their grueling fun trip: They set fire to a run - down French restaurant at the door of the weather; they interfere with the ride of the Voltian anvil; and the English are eager to get to know the contents of the Voltian home.
For the last moment, they're all drawn up, but they look like little children's television shows, as funny and as violent as they are.
It's a lot of stuff.
And at this time, like other English films, I wondered: Could Rowan Atkinson not easily make a roll in the British movie?
Leber Party decided that the British were planning to work four days a week and pay five days a week
Jeremy Corbins Leber explains that the British are considering a four - day plan to work and pay five days a week.
The party feels that the company's owners should give the workers a day's extra money saved by artificial intelligence (AI) and give them one day's reign.
This will give workers three days a week, but will not be cut in wages.
According to sources, this idea is 'sitting' in financial terms and threats to lowering the country of the party to the benefit of the workers.
A four-day week trade union congress has awarded workers the opportunity to take advantage of the changing economic system.
A senior liberator party source told The Sunde Times: 'This year, changes are expected to be announced.
'Not tonight, but the four-day work week is an expectation that is consistent with the view of the parties to reinvigorate the economy and the industrial turmoil of the parties.'
The Leber Party, not the first party to award such an idea, had pledged a four-day work week in their preaching of the 2017 World Elections.
However, this expectation is not fully won by the present - day Leber Party.
The spokesperson for the Leber Party said: 'The four-day work week was not considered by the party, but not by the party.'
In the past week, Minister of Economy John McDonald explained their view of socialist movements in the economy in more detail.
Mr. McDonald said they're determined to withdraw the authority of the service agencies' 'faceless manager' and 'from the NGOs'.
The plan of the economic ministers also means that current taxpayers in the water institutions can't get back the full amount of their income because the government can 'distort' the abuses that appear there.
They also approved plans to create a total of 10 percent of the private sector's membership in the company's management councils, as well as to provide employees with annual benefits of up to £500.
Lindse Graham, John Kennedy "60 minutes" tells us if the FBI's investigation has changed our mind.
The investigation of the FBB's allegations against the Court of Justice has led to at least one week's final submission to the Supreme Court, and the findings of the Bureau have raised a question as to whether any member of the Republican party can withdraw their support.
In an interview published on Sunday, "60 minutes" journalist Scott Pelly asked Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham of the Republican side if they could find anything that would change their views.
They spoke more freely than their partner in South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I have heard the voice of the dead, the voice of the dead, the voice of the dead, the voice of the dead.
All of this happened, and he came up to the charge and I called him and said, "Did you do it?"
They were neutral, stubborn and unconcerned."
Graham’s opinion, however, seemed to be determined.
They said, "I've decided on the Bret Coven, and there's only one big charge he can change," they said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett's full-fledged accused," Graham Christian Blaci went on to say.
"And she couldn't discern every man who was called by her name.
This is 36 years old.
I don't think there'll be any change in this."
What is the Global City Festival, and have they done anything to eliminate poverty?
The next Saturday, New York, is the world’s largest music festival organized by the Global St.
In the seventh year of the Global City Festival, thousands of millions of people will be gathered in the Great Lon of Central Park to enjoy the art of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendis, not only for their enjoyment but also for their real purpose. It is intended to bring the world's daily poverty to an end by 2030.
The Global City Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Powerty Project (Global Poverty Project) by the international group that hopes that poverty will be eradicated.
In order to gain free access to this partner (if you don't want to buy a VIP access), visitors of the partner had to take over some of the tasks or "actions" altogether. For example, to work as a volunteer to spread their goal of global inequality, to email a world leader, to call or to depend on any other meaningful way.
But how successful has the 12 - year - old Global Position proved to be?
The idea of organizing free music for people is an honest way to inspire people to act, or do people just think that there's something different about what's called "clickingvism" in an online journal or tweeting?
Global City says that since 2011, their supporters have had a record of more than 19 million "actions" for different purposes.
They say that world leaders have been helped to make $3,700 million, or more, publicize promises and promotions that will affect more than 225 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group illustrated the 390 times and announcements it has made, including at least a thousand million dollars already distributed or packaged.
The group is expected to have a direct impact on the lives of some 649 million people around the world as a result of the available funds.
Some important periods include power off-neutrition. Power off-neutrition is a partnership between the U.S. and the organizers, who "helps children to progress fully" and who, after more than 4700 tweets from citizens around the world, have assured the country that 35 million dollars are spent to avoid food shortages in Rwanda.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make food-related social injustice an issue in the history of low food," said the director of Power of Nutrition Traci Ulman at a music audience in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 efforts to improve the diet of mothers and children in the United States, the government announced a bill for the Power Off Food Project, which will reach 50 million women and children with food aid.
What makes you think of the questions that are repeatedly asked on their website, "Why do you think we can solve poverty in a very bad way?"
Global City said: "This will be a great and difficult way - sometimes we fall and fail.
But we will succeed, just as our first common rights and prejudices are, because we have been strengthened by the gathering together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mandes, Cardie B, and Janel Mone will be among some of the artists who will be present at this year's event in New York City, where Deborah-Le Fernès and Hughes Jackman will be involved.
Russia can use the US node to stop energy exports from "unblocking" - Intermediate library
The Washington Examinor has stated that the U.S. International Secretary Ryan Zink will use the node to prevent other markets from entering the Russian Middle Ages.
Zink claims that Russia's participation in Syria - especially where Russia is working at the invitation of its legitimate government - is an excuse to look for a new market in energy.
"Because they're in the middle of Eastern Europe, I think they're supposed to be in the middle of South Europe," said Zinc.
These are the ways and the means by which you may be led, according to the authority of the authorities.
They said, "If you need to make sure that you don't get their energy into the market, then the U.S. States have the ability to sew.
Zink Konsumer Energe Alliances spoke before a program organized by a group on the principle of morals. The group called itself "the voice of energy customers" in the U.S.
They compared Washington’s role in Russia and Iran and indicated that it was the same as it was in effect.
"It's less expensive for Iran and Russia to take advantage of engines and use alternative engines," they said to Russia as "Van Trick Pony" and Russia's economic system is dependent on living power.
The authorities of Trump have been involved in increasing exports of natural air to Europe while trying to establish Russia, which is the only option for European customers.
As a result, U.S. president Donald Trump is attempting to bring Germany out of the "unfair" project. According to the Trump project, Moscow has "caught" on Berlin.
Moscow reiterates that the 1,100 million dollars North Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the current pipeline capacity by 11,000 cubic meters, is a fully cost-effective project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s opposition to the project is only for financial reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"Energy cannot be a means of creating pressure and I believe that customers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after a meeting in Moscow in September with US Secretary-General Rick Perry.
The U.S. has been severely affected by the fall of Germany, and the project has been described as a construction project.
The German Federation of the German Industry (BDI) is instructed to refrain from the U.S. U.N. corruption and the standstill agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"When our energy supply is intervention from third countries, it is a big question for me," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin after the last meeting of the federation of German Industry (BDI).
Members of Massachusetts said that Elizabeth Warren would "pay close attention" to the 2020 presidential election.

President Donald Trump called "the County was leading the wrong way," Warren argued with Trump during the Town Hall.
They said, "I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our population."
Tromps and they have been clearly expressing their criticism of the convoys designated in the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We definitely need an FBI check before we argue."
However, a survey published on Thursday found that most people in Warren’s own coalition do not feel that they should fight presidential elections in 2020.
According to the Sofok University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Pole, eight percent of "Possible" Massachusetts officials said Warren should not fight elections.
The majority of the people who made such a choice showed support.

One year after the 26 - year - old track Palin was listed in September in Iraq.
They were arrested on Monday night and subjected to domestic violence.
"What the son of my belly is going through, what he's going through, what he's going through, and what he's coming back from," they told the audience at the Donald Trump meeting in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as "an open-ended murderer" and said about their son and other soldiers, "They are a little different when they come back, they come in black and white, they come back thinking that their military brothers and their armymen and every member of the army are honored here."
According to Vasil Police spokesperson Dan Bennet, Track Palin was arrested in the village of Alaska on Monday, and reported on domestic violence and drug abuse and committed domestic violence with a woman.

The U.S. Civil Liberties Union did not disclose the full name of the parade in Greece.
She said her partner "and the children of her violent team members" abused her, but the U.S. officials refused to ask her for relief on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
Greek-backed lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as a country facing the problem of group and domestic violence, where the U.S.A. is a large number.
A decision taken by the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2014 was followed by a new U.S. Assassination decision that allowed refugees who had fled from domestic violence and who had not been registered to apply for entry into the country.
In a request made on Friday by Attorney General Carl Resin of Colombia, he said that the new corruption "has been ignored by governments, organizations and international law for decades."
"All charges for Assyria under federal law must be brought to justice according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban would be a violation of the law," said a friend of the court brief.
In a letter, lawyers further argued that the US economy was damaged by the refusal to move in because of the lack of access to immigration and the possibility of "requirement of employment".
The Attorney General Jeff Session ordered the judges involved with the immigrants in June not to allow the victims of domestic violence and group violence to enter immediately.
"Because they are members of the sect, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion, there is an opportunity for those who leave the country for fear or persecution," the session said in a announcement on June 11th.
All the problems that threaten people around the world -- the very serious problems -- were never expected to be resolved quickly.
Increased numbers of dead people in the search for the living have made efforts to relieve the suffering
The situation was getting worse for the living.
Risa Kusuma, the mother of 35-year-old, said, "It's very tense."

Hundreds of people were injured, and 7.5 people were seriously injured.
Some of the injuries, including the fractured text and bones, were taking rest outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside because of persistent severe reactions.
When the earthquake struck the fifth - floor room in the hotel with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was under the floor of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, saying that his family had married in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she calmed down.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope that they will be safe."
U.S. ambassadors accused China of 'dading' with the help of 'propaganda'
One week after the official Chinese newspaper released a U.S. daily, a U.S.-China newspaper announced its four-page advertising of U.S. trade benefits, the U.S. president of China stopped using the U.S. press to broadcast propaganda on being.
On Wednesday, November 6, after the U.S. president of the U.S. Nationalist Donald Troppe accused of being involved in a riot in the U.S. Congress elections, who broke down China - the most recent newspaper in the state of Iowa - gave the Chinese daily allowance from the Des Moines Register.
China's attempt to disrupt the U.S. elections is a new chapter in the growing campaign of China's pressure on Reuters, according to the U.S. authorities.
Although advertising by a foreign government is a common cause for commercialism, business wars in Beijing and Washington are now increasing, and as a result, they are gradually being smuggled into each other’s imports.
The Chinese and American experts say that the design of the Chinese reactionary shell, which was at the start of the trade war, was intended to influence exporters of the states, such as Iowa, who supported the Republican side of the trumpet.
China's long-term governor of the export of agricultural land, U.S.S.A., said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in The Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad writes, "China is now reluctant to give propaganda advertising in our own free journalism."
"The Chinese government is taking advantage of the free speech of the United States and the traditions of free journalism," writes Branstad.
"On the other hand, the newspapers on the streets of Beijing contain conflicting suns and do not reflect Chinese views on the difficult economic launch of China, because the media is under the strict control of China's communist party," they say.
He added that "a Chinese newspaper headline has banned the offer of publishing their articles," they did not just mention the newspaper's name.
Analysts have warned that by defeating the Republican Cavano before the Middle Ages, women are depressing their consciences
A number of top republics have been warned by and protected by Bret Caven, the Supreme Court-designated person who is charged with various charges of sexual harassment, especially in the coming Middle Ages elections.
This is a very strong feeling, and most Republicans are officially showing that they are going to comment on it.
Those things can't be reversed," said Professor of the University of the University of Cirkaus, of the University of Maxwell, Grant Rehir, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Rihar said that Cinter Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) doubted if it would be enough to calm angry MPs to check for FBI at the time.
According to the Washington D.C. Newspaper, "What happened will not be forgotten by women - they will not forget tomorrow and will not forget in November," said National Speaker Karen Gene-Pierre, chief advisor to the Propaganda Group on Friday.
On Friday morning, after a witness from Dr. Christine Blasci Ford, who also supported the Republicansi Caveno's nomination for the panel, the exhibitors in the Sinet Hall were saying "November!" as Mike reported.
"Democrat's enthusiasm and motivation are running out of focus," political analyst Stu Rodenburg told the news site.
"People say it's already on the highest level; it's true.
But it can grow more, especially the stable women in the suburbs, as well as the 18-to-29-year-olds who don't like presidents, they don't usually argue."
Even before the public evidence explaining the charges of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if they agreed with the Republicans, they could be punished.
"This has now become a sort of confusion for the Joppa," said NBC News Director of the National Committee of the Republic, Michael Steel, at the beginning of the week.
"It's only about the committee's opinion or the last opinion or the creation of a canvas, but it's not limited to how they handled the Republicans and how they've treated it," the chairman of the Priority SSA Group, Ge Cecil, who is helping to select the democracies, spoke to the News Channel.
However, in the United States, more than a few more years ago, the background of Ford and Kavano’s Witnesses, about whom they have faith, appears to be double.
If 41 percent of the respondents believed in a new pool, or possibly in a Ford, 35 percent said they believed in a cave.
Also, 38 percent of people said that if Kavu were to tell a lie or possibly a lie during the witnessing period, only 30 percent said so.
After Flake requested, The Guardian reported that the charges made by Deborah Ramirez, as well as at least another prosecutor, were being investigated.
Last week, Ford testified to the oath before the Sinnet Court Committee that when he was 17 years old, Kavano attacked them in a state of drunkenness.
Ramirez accused them of opening their sex in the 1980s when they were studying in Elle, a party designated by the Supreme Court.
Global Wide Web parents are currently planning to start a new web site to face Google and Facebook
World Wide Web researcher Tim Burners is launching a startup that will face rivals Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest popular technology project, 'Inerpt', is a company with free sources from Burners-Lei on the Solid platform.
Whether to allow users to save their data or to select which data to enter.
In a special interview with the fast company, Bernards-Leine said the purpose of the interview is to "go ahead of the world".
"We need to do this now," they said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
This app uses solid technology to allow people to create their own "custom online data storage" or poody.
It can include contact lists, mailing lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
This means that the Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in the same browser and at the same time.
This is a special reason for storing personal online data that is stored by a user.
The company calls it "personal capabilities from the data media."
According to CIO, John Bruce, the idea of a return is to bring the company’s resources, processes, and skills together to provide solidity for everyone.
The company now includes a security platform purchased by Burners-Lei, Bruce, and IBM, a team of some developers who have agreed to work on the project, and a team of volunteer coders.
Since this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own self - centered apps using the tools available on the Internet.
Bernards-ley said they and their association are not talking about making a complete change in their business models at night.
"We don't ask their permission."
Burners-Lei writes in a post on the medium published on Saturday that "the goal of the interview is to help maintain the integrity and quality of the new web, which is based on solidity, to provide professional energy and the state-of-the-art system."
In 1994, Bernards-Leine had installed a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and reorganized the Internet.
In recent months, Bernards-Leine has raised an effective voice in net neutrality.
While launching the input, Burners-ley will continue to be the founder and manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very hopeful for the next century," Bernards-Ley added.
Bernard Van: First World War Victoria Cross Clerical Celebration
In the first world war, a celebration was celebrated 100 years later by the Church of England which won the Church of England over as a warrior.
On September 29, 1918, the Colonel of the River Bernard Van won a victory in the Belanglais and Lehacourt attack.
However, four days later they were shot with a bullet in their hideout, and they never knew that the British army had the greatest honor.
On Saturday, two of their children, in the town of Rashden, in the city of Northamptonshire, uncovered the tomb that they had built for their memorial.
One of their children, Michael Von, said that his father's award-winning power was "very negative after the 100-year-old drummer.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van passed through the Canal de Saint-Quentin in his leadership "from a very heavy dust and from an earthquake and from a machine gun".
They then went to the firing line and went ahead with the three detachments facing the soil alone before losing the "excessive" line.
About a month before the end of October 4, 1918, Colonel Vaughn was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Van, 72, said that their grandfather's action is "I can't do it, but it's gonna do it."
He and his brother, Dr.
Michael Van said, "They felt very honored to participate in the parade," and they said, "Because of the support given by the whole people, the audience of the real mighty man showed up."
MMA wanted to watch the 206 billet all night long, but instead they had to get a dope pie.
Imagine that you were awake all night long to watch a 206 - filled ticket, but you refused to show the main program.
There were 13 battles in San Jose, which included six battles on the main card, and the channel 5 was to be displayed right through the night.
At 6: 00 a.m., while Gerard Musey and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, Peppa spread the pie and pushed the viewers in Yuka instead of showing his cover.
Some who were especially disillusioned with the war until the morning.
One wanted to blame the kids on Twitter called "a kind of cruel laugh."
After asking about the release, "They had to program the content at 6:00 a.m. under government regulations because it wasn't possible to distribute it," senior president Dave Schwartz said in the newsletter's announcement and communication.
"Peppa the Pig," yes.
The president of the Billing Company, Scott Cooker, said that they would review their journal in order to gather the viewers in Ukraine in the future.
"I thought it was possible that we could do this when I thought about the ripple," Koker said.
But on that day were six p.m., and on that day we were not able to do it, until the day following.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, and be changed: there were many words that came to me, and they were not all friends.
We tried to eliminate him, and we felt that it was a technical problem.
But it was not like that; it was a form of government.
I can promise that this will no longer happen.
We'll keep five battles instead of six, and we've tried to give more to those who want, but we've failed.
She was a miserable situation."
Dasher Island Disks: Tom Delaide felt 'insanity' from sexuality
The Olympic driver, Tom Delly, began to feel more offended by his sexuality than anyone else - but he was motivated to succeed.
24-year-old Deli said, "Everyone isn't like me" until I went to high school.
Lauren Lavern told others about the rights of homosexuals when she spoke on the first radio 4 desert Island disks she presented.
As a parent, they also said that they lacked confidence about winning the Olympics.
Cursty Yong, a regular performer of the long - running show, took months to recover from the disease.
When she attended Lavern's first program as a disfellowshipped person, Deli told them that when they grew up, they felt "weakness" compared to everyone else because "children and girls didn't like society."
They said, "To this day, the things which were made to be wanting, and the things which were profitable, and the things which were wanting, are a great source of power to me."
They said they wanted to show them that I was someone so they wouldn't be disappointed when people knew about their sex.
Daily High-Profile LGBT Publishers, who received two-time considency in the Olympics, used their presence in Australia this year to appeal to more countries not to commit sexual immorality.
They said they spoke because they thought they were lucky and wanted to show them "hope."
Three-time world winners said the man's fall in love with Dustin Lance Black in 2013 -- "They were amazing."
Delly married Oscar, who was 20 years older than them, but he said that it was never a problem of age.
"When you were so young," they first attended the Olympics at the age of 14 and then died of their father's cancer three years later -- they said it's hard to find a person so tall.
The couple were raised by Robert Rae Black-Dellie in old age, and Delly said that they had changed their "whole view".
"If you asked me last year, I would say, 'I want to win the championship'," they said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic decorations.
Robbie is my Olympic mastermind."
His son was named Robert by his father’s name, who died of brain cancer at the age of 40 in 2011.
Delhi said they didn't accept that their father was going to die, and they asked if they had any of the last things for London in 2012 -- because they wanted to be in the first place.
"'You won't be able to sit first, Dad,' I didn't dare tell them," they said.
"When they finally took their breath, I was holding their hands, and I wasn't sure that they weren't strange until they really waited and died," they said.
The following year, Dele won the 2012 Olympics.
"I knew that what I had dreamed of in my whole life -- driving home's viewers in Olympic games, can't be any higher than that," they said.
She was also moved to choose her first song -- Praud's wife Hider Smol - who is also in agreement with the Olympics and still stands cut on his body.
Dart Island is playing on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Takes Michaelson out of the form as an extra player for the reader cup
When the American Phil Michaelson plays in front of his 47 - or Reader’s cup on Sunday, he will need to get his form back so that the clay will not hurt.
Michaelson, 12 times in this two-year event, is playing it as an extra game for the Forbals and Forsams of the Forsams.
Instead of participating directly in the game, the five - time winner, as he always does for the United States, encouraged his day and focused on the game in the range with the hope of eliminating the cause of the game.
Even in his career, he is never the easiest driver, but 48 - year - old Michaelson is not a model for the Golf National Course, where he never forgives the long - range wrong shot.
And if the course itself is not so challenging, the British Open - up winner, Francisco Molinari, who has formed an alliance with Ruki Tommy Flatwood, will face the challenge of winning all four of this week.
If the U.S. had started 12 single combats in the back of four qualities, Michaelson’s face could have become very important in the absence of a good start.
But because he had faith in his fellow player, he could not speak more.
"Today he fully understands his role, he pauses at my back and puts his hand around my neck and says he'll be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"There was a lot of self-confidence in him.
He is the Hall of Fame, and he has given these organizations much earlier and this week.
I had no idea that he would play in front of me.
I had more imagination, but I decided to do so, and I think we should go this way.
He wants to be there, just as everyone else wants."
On Sunday, Michaelson will break the spark of Nick Faldo’s greatest encounter with the reader’s cup.
Maybe it's the end of his reader's cup career that will never be able to match the height of his personal performance.
Michaelson won the 18th, lost 20 and released with seven, and said that his presence had added value to the organization.
"He's a crook, he's a liar, he's a ridiculer, and he likes people's fun and he's the best person to be with," he explained.
"With him young players will have fun, as well as this week, what they would like to wear.
It's not just a game, it's more than that."
Europe’s writer Thomas Born knows that a big shock can soon be lost
The European writer, Thomas Born, knows from experience that in the last day, the rider’s face can easily be turned into an undisputed read with sufficient precision.
In 1997, Dan made a sacrifice in the Valderama struggle, when under the leadership of Civ Balesteror, the United States had five-fold attacks on the Americans, but when they ended up in front of them, they won only the smallest difference of 141⁄2-131.2.
"You remember that we had a big hit in Valderama; we had a big hit in Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won Valderama, but only a little bit of a difference," Born said when he saw the 5-3 victory class in 2018 on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in a 10-6 hit in Le Golf National.
History will show me and everyone in the organization that it is not over.
You'll have to take all of it tomorrow.
Go your way there, and do all that is good.
This will not pass away until you have revealed your properties on the board.
Our goal is to win the trophy, and we will focus on it.
For I have told you all things. I watch over the twelve players on my side, but we know who the other side of us is. Let us play the great game of the world."
His players are pleased with the performance on the difficult golf course and Born goes on to say, "I can never go ahead with it.
Today’s challenges are different.
Tomorrow's personal display will be displayed, and it's different.
It’s good to play with your mate at all times, but when you go there alone, your ability as a golfer is like a golfer.
This message you have to let players know that tomorrow is your best day.
Now therefore leave your spouse alone, and let him alone; and let him do unto you his best.
In contrast to Born, the four of the opposition groups will enhance personal performances better than the two of their players, with the exception of Rodon Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who have acquired three of the qualities.
Furik himself faced the "Miracle of the Medieval" in Europe, before that victory, was part of the victory organization on both sides of the big-day tournaments.
In 1999, Kranshon asked his players how they were going the last day, and he answered, "I remember every word of it."
"Today is our 12 important faces, but as you saw in Brooklyn, you'll have to start as soon as you saw in Madina.
When he moves quickly, he puts himself under heavy pressure.
Let's set our line-up according to what we're going to do and let's stop our players from thinking we're going to do something magic tomorrow."
Thomas was sent to the post office to try to back up and face Rory McLarroy in the top, behind Paul Cassie, Justin Roosevelt, John Raham, and Tommy Flatwood in the other European ranks.
"I put these players in order because I thought they'd cover all sides," Born said, speaking of his own choices.
Germany’s new warship was relaunched
Local media reported that in 2014, Germany's newest war zone would have to be in place to accommodate warships during the cold war, but that it would not be charged at least until at least next year due to the bad system and high prices.
According to a military spokesman's report, "Rhyland-Phase" is now being launched in the first six months of 2019 in the Battle of Baden-Wuttburg-category.
This ship was intended to be loaded into the ship in 2014, but the future of this ambitious project was delayed due to worrying distribution-after problems.
Noodles will come in 2007 to take over the battleships of Brymen-category, which were requested by the four Bedden-Wuttburg-category ships.
It is thought that there will be a powerful storm, an airway, an anti-shipship launch, as well as some hidden technologies, such as crying, abstinence, and sound signals.
Other important features include long - term conservation — the most recent battles must be able to get far away from domestic ports for up to two years.
However, the constant longevity means that modern warships - which allows Germany to display power on the sea - have already become obsolete when the service is started.
In the past year, the AF125 war broke out, when German Nodal officials refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Lom and Foz Shipyard in Hamburg.
And it came to pass, that the shipmaster, having received the ship back by ship after the ordering of the ship, returned again to the other side.
Not much information was available about the reasons for the return, but the German media said that there were many important "software and hardware errors" and that the warship was not suitable for combating the campaign.
The lack of software was particularly important, because a ship of 120 ships in the Wooden-Wuttburg-category will be run -- half manpower in the old Brymen-category.
In addition, it was found that the ship was extremely heavy, which would reduce its performance and would not be able to categorize it in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rhyland-Phase" Germany is considered to be twice as heavy as the ships used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the entire project has become a problem with the training of the team of drivers.
It's from the start of the €2.2 billion -- amazingly to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems encountered in the newest battles in the background of the warning that the power of the German boat is diminishing are of particular importance.
At the beginning of this year, the German parliament's chief security committee, Hans-Peter Bartelsni, admitted that the boat is "decommissioned for peace."
The ruler said that the time was coming, and that the boats were being abandoned, but they had no new ship in their place.
They said, "There is no war in the middle of the sea." They said, "There is no war in the middle of the sea."
Nationalists have heard of the secret life of the ravages
A new survey was carried out in the Scottish Mountains to find out how to use the land for food.
It is hoped that new research will shed fresh light on the behavior of an inexhaustible creature and will help guide the growth of the future.
The study of researchers from the National Trust of Scotland will take place in the Inversive Gardens of the West of Rosem, as well as in the Soprano Pipistrales, as well as in the Vicars of Long-Cana and Dobington.
During the course of the season, special sound seals will be placed in the center of the property to follow the action of the bats.
NHS workers and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using head-Dell detectors.
Experts on all soundtracks will determine the frequency of the call for soundtracks and the extent to which the peoples are doing.
A map and a report of the natural habitat will be prepared to expand their behaviour on the landscape-scale.
NTS' natural conservation advisor Rob Deaver, hopes that the effects will reveal what natural habitats are important for the habitats and how each population uses them.
The benefits of the management of natural habitats, such as crop production and crop production, and other related populations, will help determine how best to store vegetables.
In the last century, there has been a significant decline in the number of gangs in Scotland and the United States.
They are in danger of losing their homes and their natural habitats affected by construction and development.
Air turbines and lighting also pose risks, as well as some chemical processes of flypapers and construction materials, as well as attacks of the plumbers.
The lightnings are not directly blind.
Even so, their ears are more likely to catch prey than their eyes because of their habit of fishing.
They're using the modern ecosystem system to find the worms and their pathblocks.
NTS has taken seriously the responsibility of caring for 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land.
There are ten trained experts who regularly visit, visit, and sometimes even provide shelter.
The organization set up the first and most isolated reserving of Scotland in the Drive State of Dumafrize and Galowe, which is home to eight of the ten peoples of Scotland.
The director of the estate, David Thompson, said that the estate was a model land for them.
"There's a good area for spiders in the drive," they said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all good natural habitats.
But there are some things which concerning strife, which we know not yet, shall help us to understand more fully what we are doing here and all other things that are necessary for their sakes.
They stress the need to check the ravages before preserving the property because it can destroy the absence of a single mother’s residence, which can kill 400 women and children, and the risk of total destruction of the local population.
It is a crime to kill, to torture, or to put them to death or to take them out of their homes.
The Scottish authorities of the Volatile Increase Trust encouraged the people to help Elizabeth Ferralyni.
They said, "We must learn a great deal about our suburbs, because we do not know what the situation of many peoples is."
Ronaldo broke charges of rape as well as prepared to attack the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo made his allegations of rape "false news" possible, and people used his name to say, "They want to preach."
The German newspaper Der Spigel, who is the prosecutor, was prepared to launch a case against the German newspaper.
In 2009, a woman named Catherine Mayorga was charged with rape at a hotel room in Las Vegas.
Der Spigel reported on Friday that she had been given $375,000 to keep her mouth shut about the event.
After a few hours of the claim's report, the Intagram immediately spoke to its 142 million followers from video to 33-year-old Ronaldo as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," Ballon D'Or victor said five times in front of the camera.
"They want to preach themselves by using my name.
It is common.
They seek to make known by my name what they are doing. But this is part of the work.
I am a happy man, and all things are right." Then he laughs and laughs.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to bring charges against Der Spigel, who say they are "a negative opinion of the regime in the area".
The lawyer Christine Shirts said that the player "can demand the equivalent of the extent of the violation for moral damage, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The accused incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Pams Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents presented at the Clarke County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at the Nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the playroom, where he raped her.
Majorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldon pointed out that he was a "99 percent" and "one percent" disillusioned him.
The documents claim that Ronaldo accepted sexual relations, but they argued that they were intertwined.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photos of her injuries taken to the hospital, but then she agreed to explain out of court because she felt "fear of violence" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated."
34-year-old Myorga says she's now understanding because she's still worried about what happened.
When the attack occurred, Ronaldo Manchester was ready to join the Royal Madrid from the United States, and went to the Italian Jaint Juveh in the €100 million deal.
Brexit: Yuke will be "repented" by his work.
When Jukeé was forced to leave the world's leading driver in the car after the break, the company said "Caym will continue to regret".
They further said that "the father of a long time" is Toiota Yuke told BBCC that if they left the U.S. without distributing Britain, they would temporarily stop production of the factory in Burnston, near their derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese engineer said that when No-Del is broken, the limit may result in a breakage of workers.
In the last year, about 150,000 cars were produced in the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the end of the year, we will see that production in our factory has stopped," said Toiot's managing director, Marvin Cook.
Honda, BMW and other UK car manufacturers, including World Land Rover, expressed concern about how border trade would go beyond the treaty.
For example, BMW says that one month after the breakout, they will keep the tiny plant in their Oxford plant.
The main concern of the workers is that the supply chain will be in danger when the NO-Del is broken.
Toiot's production line is based on the principle of "at a given time", where the car is produced on demand, 37 minutes from UK and U.S. suppliers.
If you are out of business until March 29, you may be in a position to move back to the border, and the industry may find that you are lagging behind and that you may lose your job.
Toyota will not be able to store more material in his derbyshier plant than one day, and the company will conclude that production will stop.
Mr. Clarke said that Thoresa Mee's chess plan for future relations with Euu is "exactly researched to avoid checks on the border."
"We need to complete a deal for ourselves. We need a best deal, as I said we should not only be happy and happy for now, but we need to take advantage of this opportunity," they said in today's BBC 4 program.
"This evidence is not only from Toioto, but also from other producers, for whom we need to keep this thing, through which the series provided will be very successful."
Toyota could not tell how long the production would stop, but in the long run, he warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, of course, affect the workers.
Peter Suvallaris, who worked in Burnston for 24 years and has been a United Union correspondent for the plant, said that their members are deeply concerned: "I think their employees once went to work that they will never come back.
One government spokesman said: "We have put together an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with Job."
White House said that the meeting with Rosenstein could be extended again.
Donald Trump's D.A.A. General Rod Rosenstein's High Court High Court-designated Bret Coven said that White House Sunday "can be thrown for a week."
Rozenstein oversees the work of Professor Robert Mueller, in which Russia’s elections include an examination of possible obstacles to justice between troops, troops, and Russia.
For months, the troupe dipouts of the Attorney General will not show or show the way out, and as a result, the freedom of the miller may be at risk in Washington.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein set up a virus to record a discussion with Trump, which enabled the presidents to be removed by means of the 25th revision.
“ I had no idea what I was doing, ” she says.
On Monday, however, they went to White House and discussed their political name.
Instead, a teacher’s meeting was announced to the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that they would not "opportunity" to expel Rosenstein, but with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee, the meeting was extended to avoid him, in which the hearing was to be held by Dr. Christian Blaci Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, the Trompe ordered an FBI for a week to investigate the charges against the Kwanu, which led to a longer debate of the entire sine.
The Witness was able to attend the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "It's not a date for him, it could be this week, and I think another week could be thrown behind the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we see, and we love to keep the press informed."
Some journalists argued that Sanders had not described the White House press since September 10th.
For example, the apostle Paul wrote: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near. ”
He also said that TV journalists were not content to give less details than Sanders said: "I don't deny this reality, they're showing."
They then suggested that direct contact be made between the trumpet and the press."
"These presidents are organizing more questionnaire sessions than any of their former presidents," he said, and then he said, "We've seen them now."
The details will continue, Sanders said, but "If journalists had the opportunity to ask the presidents of the United States directly, it would be a lot better than talking to me.
We're trying hard, and in the last few weeks, you're the first to do it, and when you can talk to the presidents of the United States, they'll be able to give the press details."
When leaving the White House or attending a public meeting or visiting high school, the trumpets regularly listen to questions.
The only magazines are rare.
In New York this week, the presidents may have shown a sense of urgency and curiosity in front of the reporters.
Health officials wrote to U.S. workers in NHS Scotland about the concern of the Brexit.
Health officials wrote to express their appreciation for the country's work in Scotland's NHS and their desire to stay behind.
Jean Freeman M.S.P. sent a letter in less than six months to drive her out of the U.S.
The Scottish government has already been prevented from granting a state-of-the-art application to EU citizens working in public services that are responsible for us.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman writes: "There was still a division between Yuke and Eudre, which is expected to be decided in the future.
But the UK government is also preparing for the situation without a possible deal.
I know that this is a time for you all to be greatly troubled.
That is why I now want to reiterate my appreciation for each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.
Eusebius and most of the employees bring valuable skills and experience, which strengthen and improve the health ministry, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
We sincerely want Scotland to be your own home, and we want you to stay here.
When the head was injured, a crisis was surgically performed on the abercrombie.
In the game that took place on Saturday, 31-27, Michael Organ of Tennessee announced that the head of the Vanderbilt Comodores had been traumatized by early surgery on Abercrombie by the Tennessee State Tigers Linebreaker.
The chief coach of the Tennessee State told reporters that they had been injured just a little while earlier.
"He came to Sidlain, and he crawled right there," said Reid.
Prior to laying on the stretcher and taking Abercrombs on the sideline, the trainers and medical personnel gave oxygen to Abercrombs.
A director of the Tennessee State told Nashville, in Tennessee, Chris Harris of the World SMV, that Abercrombie Vanderbilt Medical Center had undergone surgery.
Harris went on to say, "There's not enough information yet on the type or size of ice," and they're trying to figure out when the tennis state was hurt.
Abercrombie, a second - year student of a red shirt, was first playing Cison from Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the current game, he had received five totals, which resulted in his totals of 18.
More money will be taken up by foreign buyers to buy goods in the UK.
More money will be taken from foreign buyers to buy goods in the UK and additional money will be used for households under the New Tower Plan.
This will be a step to the success of the Korean campaign to attract young audiences.
This money will be placed in trust with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania for use worldwide.
To help the homeless, the prison is expected to pay up to 12 million pounds a year.
And it shall come to pass, that there shall be more money in the house of the LORD than there shall be in the land of Egypt, in the field of gold, and in the field of gold, in the field of gold, in the field of gold, in the field of gold, in the field of gold, in the field of gold, and in the field of gold, in the field of gold, in the field of gold, in the field of gold, in the field of gold, and in the field of gold, in the field of gold, and in the field of gold, and in the field of gold, and in the field of gold, and in the field of gold, and in the field of gold, and in the field of gold, and in the house of gold.
This will be seen as a step in the success of the campaign to attract young audiences to the goal of providing more affordable homes and to attract high-income people to the goal of attracting young audiences.
And it shall come to pass, that a man and his company shall be gathered together, and shall lend money in the streets, that the government shall do to them that sleep in the streets.
In a two-yearly high fee on other houses, the offer will be accompanied by a fine, and buying can be up to three percent.
It is estimated that as a result of this move in prison, up to 12 million pounds [12 million pounds] a year are expected to be spent.
According to one estimate, 13 percent of London's newly built assets are sold to non-EU citizens, making it harder to take the first step towards home buying.
Many of the country's state-of-the-art areas – especially in the capital – have become “devil villages” by foreign buyers because they spend most of their time outside the country.
A few weeks later, the printery in the school was announced to help the younger people of Boris Johnson to buy their first home.
They accused large construction companies of buying land but not using it, and they asked Ms. Mee to protect affordable houses so that the "houses" in Britain could be removed."
Mr. Corbin has announced that the proposed improvements to the construction site will include the completion of control over the mess and the "not being right".
They also want to extend their authority to build new homes.
Ms. Mei said, "Last year, I said that I would sacrifice my post to restore the best dreams of every new generation of British people.
And it means setting up a damaged building market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and make life.
But it shall not be so easy for those that dwell not in the city, and for them which labour among the Gentiles, as the British do.
For many there is a dream, and the dream is far off, and the interpretation of them that sleep in the streets is vain.
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be steward of Scotland"
Landlord Jack Ross said their "final goal" was to become Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scott, the North-East Club, is enjoying the challenges of rebuilding the club, and the top three points are less than the top three and are in the third place in the league forest.
They have moved to the stadium of the light, where they are taking St. Mary’s to the Scottish Premiership to guide them to the previous session.
"I wanted to play a game for my country.
I got a Bcap and got that much," said Rose in the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But when I was a little boy, I grew up playing Scotland with my father in Hampden, and this has always drawn me.
It will only happen when I succeed in the management of the club."
In the past, Rose’s manager, Dick Advocate, David Moies, Sam Alderdis, Martin O’Neil, Roy Keen, Gas Poette, and Paulo De Canio, saw the work.
Maggio Aloa Atlique’s owner said that he was not afraid to follow such names in such a large club, when Barnes and Ipswichtown rejected their proposals.
"At this point, I'll be able to measure my success by saying, 'I'll take this club to the Prime Minister's League.'
Because of the structure and facilities of the club, the club is definitely worth going to the Prime Minister's League," they said.
"It's not easy to take him there, but if I could take him back to the club, I might think I'd be successful."
During the 15-month period of the assistant employer in Dumberton and the 15-month training worker in Harts, Rose's administration has been only three years.
They then helped Aloa to improve the third tire since her release, and they reached the winner’s mark from the possibility of getting out in the next session.
And Rose says that they are more satisfied with their cliques, hartlepool, falsic, St. Mary’s and Hamilton Academic’s more than the first to play.
They remember that accepting Aloa's burden was, "Maybe he was really smart,"
"I really think management was better for me than playing."
This seems strange to me, for I have played the harp, and have made the righteous habitation, and have robbed the upper parts of the earth.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a number of things each week.
Even today, I still feel under pressure and pressure, but I still feel that the management is appropriate.
I always wanted to manage it, and now I'm doing it, and I've been working my entire adult life in my own way, and I'm most satisfied with it."
On Sunday, September 30, you can hear the whole interview on Sportssound between 12:00 and 13:00 B.C.E.
According to the survey, the exact time for drinking is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday evening.
Its heat has increased Britain’s treadmills, but the pressure on the restaurants has increased.
According to the report, in July, the number of pubs and gangs increased by 2.7 percent — but the number of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
In July, Peter Martin, of the Centre of CGG, who has compiled a series of statistics, said: "Longer part of England's expectations for the sun and the sun, meaning that the previous June, too, was repeated, with more than 2.8 percent of the restaurant's exposure, the pope's business.
In June, 1.8 percent of the restaurant’s businesses increased in July.
The restaurant’s business was limited, and the supply of more drinks and drinks was very strong.
Even the drug - supply pages, although not as casual as those who run restaurants, have become weak.
And they went out, and came out to drink.
In that month, sales of well - prepared coffee and beer increased by 6.6 percent, and the stocks dropped by three percent.
Peace and hospitality analyst Paul Neuman of the RSM said: "We are looking at this as the outcome of the last broadcast since April.
In the field of external sales, weather and important social or gaming programs are the most effective elements.
It's not very surprising that the groups are struggling, although the cost of spending is very low in 4.8 percent compared to last year.

Ilyid Dial was selected on the board of the Scottish Athletics as a non-profit manager at the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Daily is Scotland’s most popular track and field gamers, and President Ian Beaby described this as the best opportunity for those who have benefited from their extensive international experience in more than a decade.
Ilidus has great respect for Scotland, the UK and the world players, and we are confident that bringing them on board will greatly benefit the players in Scotland," the BBC said.
Dale said, "I am eager to be a voice for players and I hope to contribute to and guide the game in Scotland."

Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
There was a breakdown in the advertising of the Brest pump, which compares mothers to cows.
An on-line advertisement that compares breast-feeding women to those who give milk to women has been broken up by a brast pump company.
When launching a "first-rate breast pump in the world", Konsumer Tek Company Alvini showed the mother-in-law new pumps showing freedom in a provocative music video.
The four true mothers are dancing on the floor of the room, as follows, "Yes, I give milk, but you can't see my tail," and "if you don't notice, they're not weird, they're my bones."
And the voice of Korah singeth, Cast ye him down, cast ye him down, cast him into the midst, cast him into the midst, and I will cast him out; and I will take the milk of my daughters.
However, this advertisement, published on the Facebook page of this company, has raised online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of flocks, the video was mixed by viewers, who believed that many people had taken the "trace" of the secondary industry.
"The use of songs for advertising this product is a very bad decision."
Within a few days of birth, the exception is removed from them, and they become pregnant like us, and give birth to a baby for milk," he wrote.

Another wrote, "Truly for both mother and child there is distress.
But yes, why don't they use them to advertise the breast pumps that keep their babies?"
Another writer wrote, "It's an unrelated advertisement."
Where others supported this advertisement, a woman accepted the song as "Majsir".
"I think it's a big idea.
If I still drink, I'd get one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow
It’s a little weird, but I feel good about what I’m doing.
It's an unusual product," one wrote.
Another wrote, "There is also a lot of fun in advertising for mothers who are pumping (including at their place of work or at their place of work) and who feel like cows."
Neither let them praise it, nor make it their own business, nor make it their own.
They reveal that the group of women in the last video was regularly pumping and dancing in their bra.
The idea of this campaign is based on the views of many women who use breast-pumps.
However, the ELV pumps are completely silent, there are no stars or nuns, and they exactly sit in the nursing bra, which allows women to move freely, catch children, and even go outside during the pumping.
Mother’s partners and ICD Ana Balerin expressed the view: Elvy Pump is a sophisticated production that needs to be launched in an open and exciting way.
The woman who was drinking in the kitchen and the singers in the diner, the wonderful knowledge of the freedom that is giving us new pumps, the display of a fun and related ways, the brat pumping and all its challenges were to bring to light.
This is not the first time that Elves has been in the news.
During the London fashion sale, for designer Marta Jacubowski, one of the two mothers was found to be using catalysing the production.
Hundreds of displaced children moved peacefully to the tent camp on the Texas border.
Although the monthly border crossing continues to be unalterable, the number of displaced children under control has increased in some ways, as the severe language and precautions presented by the trumpet administration have made it difficult to keep children with the projectors.
Traditionally, most projectors themselves are moved without papers, and when they come forward to accept a child, they are afraid to risk their own ability to stay in that country.
In June, when the Federal authorities announced that potential projectors and other adult members of their home would have to shave their hands, and the data would be transferred to the local authorities, the risk increased.
Last week, the chief of immigration and customs agency witnessed to the Congress of Matthew Alberts, who said that the agency had arrested some of the people who had asked for someone else’s assistance.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been found guilty.
"About 80 percent of people who are projectors or projectors' households are illegal, and most of them are involved in criminal acts.
"We have therefore begun to pursue such people," said Mr. Albens.
In order to speed up the process of children, the authorities have introduced new laws, according to Shelter Workshops, some of them will have to stay in court within a month, instead of 60 days ago.
Many people will be present at the video conference instead of being personally present for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who see it will soon be driven out of the land.
According to reports from Shelter Workers and recent months, children may be more concerned or depressed as they live in a cage for as long as they can get violent or run away.
The lawyer says that such problems are growing in large - scale facilities such as Tornillo, where children with large numbers of them find themselves in extreme conflict.
He added that children who were taken to the tent city are being further affected by the fact that they do not have time to prepare emotionally or communicate with their friends.
Syria urged the US, French and Turkish to leave the country immediately.
Speaking at the UN General Meeting, Foreign Minister Valid Al-Malem, even though the country's war has reached its eighth year, also said that Syrian refugees should return to the country.
Mulem, who are also vice-presidents, said that foreign soldiers on Syria's land are illegal due to the evidence of combating terrorism, and "will be treated properly."
They said, "They're going out of the country fast and they don't want to do anything about it," they said at the meeting.
Mulem insisted that Syria's "war on terrorism is nearing its end", where 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been homeless.
They said, "All the Syrian terrorists of the terrorist group and "no alien has been cleaned up, Damascus will continue to fight the holy war."
There are more than 2,000 United States troops in Syria, leading Kurdish Army and President Bashar Al-Asad, who are training and advising Syrian Arabs who oppose.
In this war - torn country, France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground.
Mulem said that they were in a position to return, but they blamed "some foreign countries" for "spreading unwarranted fear," which moved them to stay away from the shelter.
We've asked the international community and humanity to clean up their way back," they said.
"What they wanted to be purely humanist, they're politics."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any reconstruction until the war is over and the conflict is over.
U.N. diplomats say that prior to the political news, journalists have had an opportunity to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel zone of Idlib of Russia and Turkey.
The Russian-Turkey Convention has avoided a massive attack on the Syrian military port, supported by Russia, where there are 30 million people.
However, Mullem stressed that the treaty was a "clearly defined timeline" and hoped that the army's activities would be targeted and set a target for the war in Nursa-Français and for the war in Nursa-Français.
UN envoy Staffan de Misturra hopes that the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members will be held soon to create a post-war agenda for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
The members of the committee held a meeting of the Syrian government, saying that the panel’s work should be limited until the current rules of procedure are in place and warned against any action.
Why the Trumpet Will Win the Second Period

There is no wonder that Pennsylvania's 17th century is full of money, which is responsible for the reconstruction of Congress jails for the same place.
He recently re-established the Democratic Republic of the Congo long in Pittsburgh District, which won its place in a special election last spring.
In front of the long second candidate, the Republican Kitt Rothfoss, who was currently representing the 12th century of Pennsylvania, was a large number of the 17th century.
After the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which had been issued by the former Zilhe Republicans, had been improperly made, the map was re-established.
For the new 17th, a campaign between the main party's financial side, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC) began.
In the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, the name of Long Pennsylvania became known after a brief victory.
The place had been suspended by the Republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the town.

U.S. Support for China decided to punish El Salvador, then changed its decision
After a few visits from Washington, D.C., the Dominican Republic and Panama had already approved Bising.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Verela, and they had a hotel in Panama until the organization of the Trump organization was gone.
State Department officials called back on the U.S. Chief of Diplomatic Missions El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panamanian authorities "from the recent decision not to approve of the ceremony" in early this month.
However, El Salvador had only been punished, which had received US$ 14 million in 2017, including cash control, development, and financial assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts and targeted visa bans, would make the country in Central America painful because there are too many jobs and killings in the country.
As the meeting went on inside, North American and Central American officials launched a high-level approach to security and financial prosperity-oriented measures to prevent immigrants coming to the United States last year.
But by mid-September, the top government has explained that they want to move forward and bring to an effective conclusion any punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens will now be discussing this issue, which has now been set up in October and in the signal to invite the administrative areas to the conference, said Diplomats.
And all three U.S. politicians returned peacefully to a Salvadoran, Dominican Republic, and Ponymouth without any new or harsh message from Washington.
For Mr. Bolton, the White House spokesperson refused to give details of the discussion, which was described by three American officials with two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the debate on the issue of integrity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst, who was close to the administration and spoke on the basis of anonymity.
Study history
The following dramatic events may be the case of Mr. Tromp’s special editor, Robert Mueller, who is now very evident in the public gallery.
According to reports, Mr. Muller is also turning his attention to what is happening in his election with Russia and Mr. Tromp's campaign machine.
If the Congress were to change, Mr. Trump would see himself shouldering responsibility in that organization when they are ready to go back to the audience, and perhaps eventually they'll go to the jury of their peers.
There's a lot in there, and I don't mean that Mr. Trump's defeat is permanent – or his opponent's defeat in Europe.

What should we do if Mr. Trump removes General Rod Rosesten, who is handling the sources of Mr. Miller’s custody?

According to Mr. Rosenston, The Times’s account is wrong.
If Brett Kwango is not perfect or is not fair, what would we do if we decided to send them to the Supreme Court, even when they are accused of sexual misconduct and dishonesty?
In addition, will we take the midterm election for Congress and be held responsible for this, Mr. Trump?

Allegorical Planners requiring a severe death penalty for a suspected New York terrorist attack
Fasi training is being sought for federal developer Sieflo Siepov in New York. The alleged allegations of a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people were killed -- since 1953, the government has not been severely punished by the government for the war crimes.
In October, 30 - year - old Cypoven used a home depo truck to attack the western side of Manhattan on a dirt road near the western highway.
In order to punish the outbreak in South York City, the planners will have to prove that Cypovan "health" took the eight victims and "health" caused serious physical harm.
According to the Court’s documents, the death penalty can be taken into account in both cases.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury dropped the charges against Siopov on 22 January. This included eight charges of murder with the help of a rocket. In general, the case was accused of the destruction of organized crime and of the destruction of motor vehicles.
When describing what Cypovan did as 'the world, cruel and shameful', the lawyer said that it was necessary to 'set' importance and advance notice' for the attack.
"Ceflo Habibulvevik Cypovne Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lore Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlyz, Harnon Feruchi, Hornan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pgnuko have suffered from ill-treatment, ill-treatment and harm."
Five of the victims were visitors to Argentina.
In the south of New York City, the death penalty has been suspended for a decade.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but he was finally sentenced to life in September 2009.
In the past two years during the Cold War in 1953, the married couple, Julius and Ithel Rosenberg, were sentenced to a period of imprisonment during the Soviet Union’s cold war.
On June 19, 1953, the couple in Rozenberg were killed by an electric kurchi.
According to the judiciary, the original citizens of Uzbekistan, Cypriots, showed a lack of remorse in the days of the attack.
The police said that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Siopov told the inspectors that he was moved to attack after watching her video on his cell phone.
The police said that he had asked her to keep the ring in his hospital room.
He insisted that we be innocent of the 22 - page charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Cyprus, said he was "completely disappointed" about the plan decision.
Paton said, "We believe that the death penalty should be imposed, that accepting any request for an adjudication would increase the suffering of everyone involved in this event.
The Cyprus Protection Agency had previously ordered that the planners not be punished with impunity.
Tori says that Nigel Farz should be the president of the Brexit Department.
During the ban on Tori, Farz vowed to establish 'the People's Army'.
The U.S. presidents said that politicians should be allowed to sit on the Eurospeptics tree, as Theresa Mee suggested, and that they should have sources of division with Eu.
Democrat Peter Bone told the Burmingham team that if Mr. Farez were secretary-in-chief, he would have been 'out of the Yuke'.
However, the supporters of Ramon Toriz have been more clearly confronted with obstacles to the breakup of the Sri Lankan Mae group by making independent demonstrations in the city of Brazzit.
In the storm of criticism from the breakers, the reminiscaries, and the Eu, they also have to learn how to keep their schedules in order to keep their schedules.
Friends say that if they oppose, they should try to establish a relationship with Brussels, and they should bring Eurospeptics and Leber to the side with pressure to choose from their plan or 'disagreement'.
Mr. Bon explained in front of the Lev Mans Live Raily in Solihal that they were supposed to 'complete their relationship with chess'.
They also suggested that Mr. Faraz should be taken with them to be responsible for the divisions with Brussels.
But if these things had been so, they would have spoken of us.
Wellingboro said, "I'll stand by the brakes, but we have to get the hammer out."
And they of them that stood by said, We had no part in the world, that we might gain a second place.
We want our laws in our own country.
After the 2016 elections, the generation has changed, Mr. Bone said: "It is wrong for British citizens to change their minds, their demands, and now that they want to stay in this system."
Tori Brazzitair Andria Jenkins was also present at the funeral. Speaking to reporters, they said, "I'm just saying, listen to what the president says.
There's anger in the general public about the chess, the opposition won't criticize them, the opposition on our side and our officials who choose us to be the top level is the opposite of the chess environment.
Please quit the chess game and start listening to the opinions of others.
In his clear message to Mrs. May, they said, "It is only when the Lord fulfills his word that they are able to keep their position."
When speaking to Morse, Mr. Faraz said that politicians who tried to betray their generation in 2016 should only put a stop to this.

The Baton Rage Police Department reported arresting 20 - year - old Deton Simpson at the 11th IT News Conference.
The video of the shooting was released by the police to identify the person who was seen in the video footage.
On Friday morning, 20 - year - old Sims was shot and killed at the University of Southern Camps.
"The head of Wade Sims was shot and died in it," reports police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media.
The waves fell to save their friend, and the sympathies swung at them.

Russian Grai: Louis Hamilton Yoon, who came down to the field under the organization’s command, humiliated Sebastian Vetell in a global victory
On Saturday, more qualities than Louis Hamilton had become popular with the Walter Bott, it was clear that the Order of the Mercedes Society would now be important in this competition.
Botas had just started well from Poland. He had taken the place of Hamilton on the first two shifts and had brought Hamilton out close, so it was time for him to give up the game in his own organization.
Hamilton left the package at the end of traffic and went to the Pitts before he left. In fact, the action was to be decisive.
Mercedes then went back to the back of the hotel, but after a few very sad moments, Hamilton moved on and the driver of the Ferrary had to let the woman in for the third place have the risk of double motion.
Max Versetapen started from the back of the grid and reached the end of the first stage of his 21st birthday contest.
Then he moved on to finish the race, leaving Kimi Rikonen behind for fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th lap, he came to the Pitts, but in his fourth place, Rikonen was unable to increase his speed.
It was a hard day, and it was a very good day.
"Hamilton said it's an extraordinary job to get a forest tue," said Hamilton.
This is certainly a serious offense.
Christine Blase Ford, accused of sexual assault by the nominee Bret Kwaongo of being a judge of the Supreme Court. However, we have not brought out the letter of the accused Ford, says Fenstein, Senator Dien. President Donald Trump said that Fenstein's claim was false at a meeting held on Saturday.
Speaking directly at a meeting in West Virginia, the presidents of Ford did not mention the witness given by the Senate Jewish Committee, saying that what started in the Senate was clearly how people have become 'satisfied, angry, and lying'."
"From the days that have gone by in the Senate, what can happen is that when you see people angry, angry, selfish, and lying."
"You see the famous papers, she licks and then says... oh... I haven't done it."
I didn't."
Remember?
Dane Fenstein, did you miss this?
Do you remember the answer... did you write these papers... "What did you say?"
Oh, no.
I didn't miss her."
An, wait a minute.
We missed it, we didn't, we didn't do it," the presidents just said in the style of the Senator.
Ford was sent to Fenstein in response to the charges against Kwaongo in July, and they were executed in early September... but Fenstein has refused to sign this letter from his office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, but I didn't cancel their letters, Fenstein reported to the committee.
They told me to hide it, and I kept it as I did.
But they didn't care much for their leaders, and they said to them at the meeting on Saturday night, "I'm telling you, it's a bad thing to do."
They may not have done so, but the worst thing I've ever seen was the worst thing."
The president of the Supreme Court, who has been charged with sexual misconduct, said that these democrats are using these charges for their own benefit.
They are to be restored to their position of authority in any way they wish.
They don't want to see who they're tearing apart to gain power and power," the media reports.

Patrick Dwarves shot two bullets at the giants against Dundee
Dundy Starks repaid the victory in Elite League on Friday at Belfast Jaints 5-3 in the face of the return on Saturday.
Patrick Dwarves and Francis Bovillier had just won two rounds because they shot at the beginning of the fight.
Before Dwarves recuperated, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney joined the host organization.
Frank Bouchard joined Dundee, and later Lucius Lundwald Neelson won the League.
This is the third victory in the Elite League in Hong Kong for the Adam Kif Association. On Friday night, they went back and forth to Dundi 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth encounter between the two groups that were on the move, and the other three were won by the Giants.
Two shot at the first round of 3:35 in the first minute, which is four minutes before the end of the game. After four minutes, David Ruderford's support was double-crossed by Bovilier and double-increased by the organization.
The beginning of the meeting was filled with events. At 13:10 a.m., when Sullivan shot and held the host organization's challenge, he joined the team in the face of the attack at 15:16 a.m. with the help of Matt Markardt.
At the end of the first session, the Dwarves circled over to find that the organization had been hit again in the first break.
"Jeyman redesigned and at 27:37 p.m., Bokhardt shot the plant and brought it back together."
Connie and Charles Corcarin gathered together and helped Neelson to shoot. At the end of the second session, Dundi was struck first in the face. At the end of the second session, he shot the fifth round in the face, and set the battle in array.
On Friday, four of the last five matches will be played against Milton Kenes on the field next Friday.
The death of an air traffic controller that saves hundreds of air passengers from the earthquake
After ascertaining that hundreds of passengers flew safely by air, the hero was the air traffic controller for Indonesia.
The island of Sulavesi has been hit by a massive earthquake on Friday by 800 people, but there are many poor people. Tsunami are also hit by the earthquake.
Because of severe earthquakes, the whole area is destroyed and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
In Palu, the mania was heavily displaced by the earthquake in control of Sis Al-Jufri Airport, but the 21-year-old Antonius of Crimea refused to leave his place, despite the fear of other associates.
At that time, the Batik Air was on the 6321 flight deck, and he did not move from his seat to allow the plane to fly safely.
After feeling that the traffic control was failing, he fled.
In time, he died in a hospital.
His decision may have saved the lives of hundreds of visitors, says Air Navigation Indonesia’s spokesperson John Sirate, according to the Australian BBC News.
In order to take him to a larger hospital in another city, we had a helicopter in the town of Kalimantan.
We lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived.
And they said, "We've heard the news," and they said, "We're sorry for Anton."
In the meantime, the government believes that a quarter of a thousand steps of death will occur. It is difficult to reach Donggal, Singhi and Botong cities in all parts of the country, says the Emergency Management Agency.
"The number of dead is likely to increase, because many dead bodies are still under pressure and we have not been able to reach that point," said the Agency's spokesperson.
The waves of the city shall be broken down to six meters: on the sabbath day shall be the graven image of the city.
They are providing assistance and necessary things by military and commercial means.
"Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old, told Skye News: "Every minute, the pirates are bringing dead bodies.
Clean water has become contaminated.
There's a lot of fraud in small shops."
Jan Galland, chief of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "We don't know exactly what they're going to do there to help those who read Indonesian Red Cross."
It's already a very sad situation, but it can get even worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday, and said to the army, "I tell you that you should all work in the morning to do all the work.
Are you ready?" CNN said.
At the beginning of this year, over 50 people died in a earthquake in Lonbok, Indonesia.
Micronesian Air Force: Air Force is now saying that a man is homeless after a crash.
In the Pacific Ocean, an airline flying in the Gulf of Micronesia now says that after this accident there is a passenger accident. 47 passengers and workers of the submerged aircraft have been safely evacuated.
A newspaper published by Air Newsweek noted that by Saturday afternoon, the company had no man to travel.
The airline also says that we are working with local machinery, hospitals, and inspection equipment to find this person.
If the age or nationality of the trip were to be asked for more details, the airline did not respond immediately.
After the plane crashed while trying to land on the wrong island, local ships helped to rescue passengers and workers.
On Friday, the officers said that they had been taken to the hospital.
The six passengers were in the hospital on Saturdays, and their condition was stable.
Because of the air traffic jams, and the exact order of events has not yet been made clear.
Airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed before the flight took off.
Some observers feel that the flight deck has passed.
The United States passenger Bill Janisney reported that the plane was very low.
Janice said, "That was a very good thing.
But Janice said, "They and the rest of the travelers departed from the boat, immediately they entered into the boat by themselves, and were driven out of the boat.
And when they heard it, they were afraid. And they cried out, and said unto them, We have heard that we have done this thing.
Some of the ship's crews were working to repair the wreckage. The U.S. Navy reported that they were involved in the rescue. They took the crew from the inflatable boat to the coast before they drowned. They drowned 30 meters (100 ft) below.
Over the past two years, information from the Aviation Safety Network has shown that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines, but there was no one aircraft from the Air New Aviation Company.
The events of the night that the woman was burned alive have been described by analysts.
In 2014, a woman in Mississippi was accused of being burned alive by the government on Saturday night in a person's return to the charge of being burned alive.
Paul Rollett, an analyst in the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed early as an expert in the field of analysis.
On the night that the 19 - year - old Pediatric Jessica Chambers died, she and 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis explained to the press what had been done to find out what had happened.
In order to establish that Telis was with her at night, Chambers checked several cell phones' population data and checked it out. Teless previously claimed that we were not with her at night. Clairian Lazer reported this.
According to the available data, his cell phone was then near the cell phone of Chambers, and Tellis said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, and the police then went to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford came to the courthouse and testified that he was not in the city that day.
Tellis was claiming to be in a Sanford truck that night, and the prosecutors asked Sanford about it, and Sanford told him that he was lying about it.
Another factor was that we knew her two weeks ago — the death of Chambers.
The cellphones show that they only got to know each other a week ago.
After the death of Chambers, Roulette said that she had deleted all her messages, calls, and contact details on her phone.
"He took her out of his life," said Hel.
The survivor will start his final argument on Sunday.
The judge said that this was the day the jury was expected to proceed.
The High Bride: What is the Conscious hip hop?
Hip Hop Tryo, filling his musical messages with positive messages, has to challenge the negative view of this type of music.
Hie Bride, in Bristol, stated that Hie Bride has fulfilled his political message as well as the basic purpose of tackling social issues.
They want to go back to their original position and reinvigorate the Conscious hip hop.
Artists from such groups as Fujis and Commons have seen a rebellion in the UK through Aka and Loki.
Another ugly person?
A Nani in New York brought a couple to court for reducing their work on the basis of the "literal" message.
"The message that complains that she is "a creative person" is misdirected by the mother of a New York-based Nani couple who have taken away their writing from the job."
The charge of ethnicity has been dropped by a couple, claiming that it is a form of "salvation".
The new woman who came to care for the children in 2016 found her first job to be a farmman, noting that she was an agricultural woman, Linci Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, said she was unhappy.
The message "NASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS is also another creative one" was written by hundreds of Plasco-Faxmans to send the husband.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs.
After the confusion came to light, Pasco-Faxman removed Mrs. Maurice from work. She was formerly an African-American Nanny and was doing a bad job. So now we need Filipino Nany. New York Post reported this.
Mrs. Maurice was given one day’s work money and was then sent home.
Mrs. Morris is now suing the couple in court for a reduction in their salary. For a period of six months, they are demanding a daily subsistence allowance of $350. They were placed in full-time employment, but no agreement has been made for this.
"I want to show them that you can't do this," they told the Friday post newspaper. "I know it's a bit different."
The claim that there are haters of the marriage is settled, because Mrs. Maurice's husband is hurt, and cannot be trusted, because she has been able to get rid of them.
"My wife missent them what she didn't want to say."
That is not a hater of spelling.
We're not people who disagree," Joe Plasco told the post.
"But will you give the children into the hands of the same man, after you have dealt treacherously with him? Or has he committed a trespass?"
Will you bring the child to him in your youth?
It's impossible."
Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months ago, and she is now "in a very difficult situation."
"Does anyone follow someone like that?"
"That's not a very good thing," the businessman said to Plasco, an investment banker.
Although the court's case is still under trial, the Court of First Instance has issued an appeal against the couple through the social media, and their conduct and arguments are strongly grounded.
The publishers of Paddington were alarmed that the reader could not accept the idea of the donkey. A new letter opened it.
After the book was accepted, the girl of the birth of the Bond said about Karen Unkel's letter: "It's hard to understand who she was first reading about."
It's really fun to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She says that after working as a cameraman in BBC, the book was rejected by the parents who wrote books for young children. She also says that because of their disappearance last year, the book’s 60th day of light has become a ‘mixed’.
Paddington described her as "a very important member of our family" and said she was very proud of the success she had finally achieved.
She said, "They were very quiet. They never wanted to play their game," she said.
"But Paddington was as real to them as he was to them. So if his son succeeds, he's proud of us even though we're not responsible.
I feel that this is the way they looked at the success of Paddington.
They were their creator and their imagination, but they always gave their credit to Paddington."
My daughter was counting the last items and I had to give her a phone call
After Lading, her daughter was taken to a Lou Pashhur to the hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her, but they became useless.
"Node was calling me regularly and saying that the situation is very bad. She doesn't think she's coming out of this," said Ednan-Laproze.
"Well, I got Nad's phone and he said she's gonna die in the next two minutes and I want to call her a goodboy.
I told her that I wanted to serve Jehovah, and I told her that I wanted to serve him.
I said, "I love you very much, baby.
I’ll be with you soon.
I will prove to be with you.
Her heart pumping was gradually reduced by the doctors, and her whole system was shut down.
She had died just before, and everything was going to stop.
I wanted to sit and wait, and to know that everything was changing.
I couldn't cry, neither could I cry, neither could I cry; for there were families and people around me.
I really need to clean myself."
And it came to pass at the end of the hundred and twenty years, that Adnan-Laperus sat upon his daughter's bed, with all the rest of the ships; but the passengers knew not whence they were going.
"No one knew," he said.
"I was putting my value down and always shuddering from my eyes.
It was difficult to explain this, but while I was on the plane, I felt a sense of humor.
He needed to understand my love for him.
I knew how much affection he had for her.
The women also, who are in distress, put their cards to shame, that they may not commit suicide.
Two women who have lost their love for their husbands are now working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Hamphrey Welsh are sending inspirational messages and phone numbers to bridge bridges, and these phone numbers can be used to help people.
And when she was 13 years old, Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, who was 13 years old, was stricken with depression, and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want to come to any parents when I'm going through any of the things I'm going through every day," he said.
Forty-five years old, she lived in Lidney, and had a son, Odion, who was chief, and a smile on his face.
"They all knew him for his smile.
His smile always made it clear where he was going."
But he left his work before he died, for he was living in utter darkness.
In 2014, Tyler committed suicide, and only 11 - year - old brother saw him die.
Mrs. David said, "I'm just worried that something might have an indirect effect on him."
Mrs. David made the cards, "To let these people know that you can go to people you can talk to, they can be one of your friends.
Don't sit still. You need to talk."
Mrs. Hamphreys and Mrs. Davis have been friends for many years, and her husband, Mr. Hamphreys, lost 15 years of his life, and soon after his mother died, he died.
"He never said he was disappointed or disappointed. He didn't say anything," he said.
"We began to feel a little changed in his attitude every two days after Christmas.
In the day of Christmas, when the children were opening their eyes, he didn't allow them to see.
She said, "His death was a great shock to his family, but we went out of it." This caused a hole in the family.
This caused a division in our family.
But it's all we have to do is keep going and keep fighting."

Brett Kwanog’s future is a bit bleak because of FBI
"I thought that if we did get something like that -- in a certain period of time, a limited opportunity -- we might be able to bring together a little bit," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, they also said that they were afraid of falling into the practice of the Committee Party Greenlock.
Why should Mr. Kavanagh and his Republican supporters check the FBI?
They are vanity and a chasing after wind.
It's only 6 weeks for the Middle Elections, and it's 6 November every day - if the Republic's work is bad, it's going to be very low in sending the elected person to the highest court in the country.
Mr. Kwanogh was working for Mr. Bush in the White House, and using them, Mr. Kwanogh's wife, Ashley, was known for being a member of his own staff when he called the Bush Center.
What will happen if the FBI reports?
The 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will be at odds with the Senate currently in operation.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kwanongna will have at least 50 opinions in the Senate, which will enable Mike Pens, the president, to take them to the Supreme Court in the same way.
Under the chairmanship of Kim, the number of disabled people in North Korea was "decreased"
Kim Jong said seven years ago that the number of rats coming from North Korea had decreased, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Referring to the data from the South Identification Ministry, Park Bingong-Sung said that, compared to 2,706 pedestrians last year, 1127 were hit.
Mr. Park said that severe border controls between North Korea and China and the acquisition of more money from human disputes were important.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
Many in the north have been granted citizenship in South Korea.
Samuel says that by the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border.
Many people lived in China with North Korea, and crossing the border is easier than crossing the uninhabited area (DMZ) in two Koreas.
The Chinese take illegal passengers and send them back to China, rather than admitting to their refugee status.
Although the relationship between the North and the South is still technologically advanced, some months have passed since the beginning of the war.
At the beginning of this month, the two - country divisions met in Pyongyang to discuss the dangers of using the power of both countries.
This was followed by an extensive discussion of the Korean island's historic meeting in Singapore, held between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-on of the United States.
And it came to pass, that on the sabbath day, when the nation of North Korea, which was the Secretary of State Rei Yong-ho, broke through upon the throne of the United States,
"Without any belief in America, we won't feel confident about our national security, and in such circumstances we won't be able to unarm ourselves alone," Rey said in a speech given at the United Nations Summit in New York.
Nancy Pelosy Brett Kwanog says that they are "invincible" and that they are unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Home page manager Nancy Pelosci called the High Court's appointed candidate Brett Kwanwog and said they were unable to serve in the Supreme Court for some time.
Paulosy, in Texas, U.S.A., spoke at the Festival on Saturday.
"I can't do anything about it, but it seems that if a woman did, they'd call her 'beneficial'," said Pelosin about a witness to the Cinnet Judicial Committee.
Cavanrogh, both of them in the state of Paganism, was emotionally charged with sexual assault by Dr. Christine Blacie Ford.
When they began speaking, they would have become very brothers, and their families and high - school children would have been horrified.
The charge against them was that Hillary Clinton gathered together to express his anger at the election of the 2016 President of the post, and they accused the Democrats of being "comfortated with the murder of images and cartoons".
Paulosy said that the Witnesses in Kovanogh had proved that they could not serve in the Supreme Court because they proved that they were impartial in the matter of democracy.
"I think they've made themselves innocent by their speeches and by following Clinton and the Democrats."
When he was assigned to Kwanhogh and was privileged to attend the meeting of the representatives of the Democratic People’s Party, he found it inappropriate to ask questions about their status.
"I'll say so-- that they don't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, they're not in the Supreme Court, they're not even qualified for the court now," said Pelosi.
Kwanwogh is now a judge in the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosini said that as a democrat, the Affordable Care Act or Ro - V. Wed is concerned about the possible claims against them, since he is considered a prosecuting judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kwanogh left his question as to whether you would reject some of the rulings of the Supreme Court.
"There's no time to expect to hear someone rude, biased go to court and say, 'How cute this is!'," said Paulosy.
And women need to use their weapons.
This sound has been heard for months and years, and she has had no choice but to cry.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's common, what do you think?"
She said, "The woman who worked for me was very supportive, and she said that she was very angry that she was crying, but she developed a system that said when she was angry and had to cry, she said to the man who was saying, 'You think I'm crying because I'm sad.
I'm angry."
Then he went on to say: “I am going to make a helper for you, as a complement of you. ”
And I thought it was amazing."
The Bible says: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly. ”
One of the memories of my initial job is, in the office where I once saw me crying in anger, I was caught by an old woman -- the cold blood manager who I was afraid of forever -- who took my neck and led me to the wall.
"Don't let them see you crying." she said to me.
"They didn't realize you were angry.
They think that you are sad, and will rejoice in this.
So Patricia Schroeder, a woman of the Democratic Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat called Menky Business, Mrs. Schroeder was very disappointed when he was caught in marriage and we began to think about why we should not stand up for the election of our vice president.
"It wasn't an orderly decision," she smiled to me 30 years later.
"The seven candidates are already in the race and the last thing they want is another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowite and Seven Dorf."
"Because of the expansion of the Mohime, they were behind the construction of the warrants and so they decided that they would not go into this war until they had spent two million dollars."
It was a war that broke out.
She realized that her $1,000 men were giving her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting used to?" she thought to herself.
They became so disillusioned when they announced that they would not start formal protests -- the gratitude of those who supported them, the excitement of the system that made it difficult to raise money and the anger of representatives and sexuality instead of noticing the audience.
"You thought I'd be down in my heart," Mrs. Schroeder said about the symbols given to them by the newspaper.
"You must have thought that Kleinex was my corporate projector.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
"Why did she cry?"
How the U.S. and China’s commercial war can benefit from gambling
Experts say that because of the violence of trade between the U.S. and China, and there is no sign of the end of the war, the tides between these countries can become a commercialization for long periods of time.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, has given the first warning to Chinese exports with solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
This week, the value of $200 billion (£150 billion) has increased to a large extent with new rates of return from China to the United States.
Unlike the last 60 billion dollars of U.S. goods, five to ten percent of U.S. imports have been taxed every time by God and his seed.
China has sworn to align itself with the United States, and soon the world’s largest economic system will never be ignored.
Backing Washington would be fulfilling the demands, but welcoming the United States publicly would be the most disturbing thing for the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if beemaking can play its game properly, pressure from American trade wars will reduce the interdependence of both economic systems and provide positive support to China for a long time.
In fact, when the rapid political decision was taken in Washington or Beijing, the financial climate that would start in one of the two countries is more dangerous than the previously accepted ones, "This is Abigail Grace, a research associate who is focusing on Asia in a think group in Central for New American Security.
Foreign Minister says Syria 'ready' to return to Syria.
The Syrian refugees are willing to return, and they have been asking for help to rebuild the land that had been destroyed by the war for more than seven years.
Speaking at a general meeting of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Father Al-Mulem said the country's situation is improving.
"The progress made in combating terrorism today is more stable and secure in our part," they said.
To improve the situation in general, the government has continued to reinvigorate in an area that has been destroyed by terrorists.
Their daily life and the goal of life - terrorism and one-sided financial plans - are now ready to return to their country in a voluntary way.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
There is still a need for more than six million people to live in the country.
Al-Moleam said that the Syrian government would help rebuild the devastated land.
However, they stressed that they would not accept the help or help provided from the countries that helped them with the weapons.
Europe sealed the reader cup in Paris
In France, the European Union in Le Golf National, outside Paris, championed the latest properties of the 2018 Reader Cup in the United States of America from 16.5 to 10.5.
In Europe the United States has lost six times, and they have not won the Reader Cup in Europe since 999.
In the United States, for example, the Danish painter Thomas Bjerne once again won Europe’s prize.
The American Star Phil McKelson fought the same competitions, beating his T-Shott over to 316 and confronting Francesco Molineri.
Italian Golfer Molinery 4 players were the first players in all of his faeces, and in 1979, the competition started with a score of 5-0-0.
