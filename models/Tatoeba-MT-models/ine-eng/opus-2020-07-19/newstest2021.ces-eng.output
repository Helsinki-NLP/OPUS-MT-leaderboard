Novak helped Trabzonspora to the second place, hit and hit Škoda
Defender Philip Novak helped the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspora as vice-master.
His team won 2:1 at the stake of Kayserispor and held the third Besiktas.
The attacker Milan Škoda gave the tenth branch after the ice transition from Slavia to Rizespor, which was saved, even though it was 1:3 on the stake of Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed the excellent productivity of the seventh goal in this league year.
In 63 minutes, the Golman of Kayserispor just shot a bullet and the Czech footballer from the corner set the ball on the net.
The home managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute set-up shot victory on his side, when he successfully set the bridge four on one.
The damage at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce was equal to 1:1 alone.
The opposition did not last long, but it did not have to hate him, because due to the results of the rivals behind him, three points remained above the descent.
The competition brings together the Sunday duel of the master Basaksehir on the Kasimpasy playground.
Well hidden in the caves of the desert in the woods of New Bor was actually not inhabited
On the north of the Czech Republic, in the foothills of the Lužiky Mountains, near the New Bor on the Českolipsk, in the woods leading the Countess Way, several sandstones are hidden.
Natural and artificially created.
And we're behind this human hand created.
The place is called the cave at the desert.
In fact, there was never a farmer here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely the hidden room probably on the crop.
The cave is pushed from the side to the rock guard and accessible by the stairs of the mountains.
But it's practically impossible to see until the last moment.
She will be exposed to the narrow stairs leading to some kind of rock gallery from where she is just entering the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human settlements, at the time of creation it could be on the upper surface where the forest is today, field.
"The fact that the object does not have a window and even in the traditional location of the heater clearly shows that there could never survive the winter," explains historian Kamil Podroužek of the Faculty of Philosophicals Jan Evangelist Purkyna in Ústí nad Labe.
A single-space object has only a stone beam behind it, which is probably used to decompose the vessel.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
On the walls of the cave are visible traces of the tools.
The cracking of the pistachio with the tip was for the whole simple and fast.
It was enough to use the spices and the peacock to gradually break down.
Depending on the length of the trail after the tip and the method of tracking, it is possible to define the period of formation of the cave.
According to history, it's probably the late 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is sometimes sleep in today’s times.
If you are approaching the cave of a mountain from one of the woods roads and we take you under the cave of a flowing stream and not far down the road, you will surely find the path down too.
And by way of the woods you may still be caught by the nearby Havrian rocks.
Zakoj Minarík is after a heavy fall in Germany in an artificial sleep
"Philip is in the best hands now.
The Institute is set up in similar cases, and we have a happy family in Hannover.
This makes it much easier for me to deal with the situation and also to take care of the daughter of Finj," the server quoted Jezdci.cz statement by Minařík's wife Katji.
"Everyone's doing the maximum, Philip needs time to rehab.
It doesn't make any sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who's ever met the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said a woman in her 50s.
For the financial support of the injured Minarík, he called on Twitter and the star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stackes in Ascott on Saturday, which matched the legend of Lester Piggott.
On the Gofundme server, nearly 70 thousand euros have been selected to date.
The target is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million kroner).
Video decision-makers took Sassuola's football players four goals, lost 0:2
The Sassuola footballers, though in the Saturday match in Naples, got a four-time ball in the race, but at last they had to deal with defeat 0:2.
Not one of their goals decides after consultation with the video because of the ossier.
According to the Italian media, it's a record of a lack of technology, so many attacks have never faded from one team yet.
"VAR was harder on Sassuolo than a road radar and punished him like no other team.
New technology markets records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a comment.
"The festival of unknown goals of Sassuol.
VAR has never been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoleon took the lead on Saturday at 8 a.m., after half an hour of the game, but it seemed that Sassuolo had settled.
The goal of Filip Djuricic was not recognized after the intervention of the videocassette due to the ossyd.
For the same reason, they did not gradually pay another Djuricic's bribes and fines by Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi.
On the contrary, another goal was added.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they won the most in history
"The growth has attracted as much as 30% of the increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of the more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of the registration of new e-autos," said Chez Tomáš Chmelík, head of clean technology service.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla's electric car manufacturer, are also reported on in the market, as well as Bill and Lidl's supermarkets.
Operators of classical pump stations are represented by the company MOL.
But she doesn't have any numbers yet.
"We started building our electricity network on the first floor," Jan Juskova spokesperson explained.
The editor, however, exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stations operated by the company ČEZ.
It follows from these that the drivers from the station received on average 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the arrival of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we remember a small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The long majority of the tankers then went free of charge.
If the motorists had already paid for the pick-up, their typical losses were around 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly in the main city.
In the territory of Prague, there are all five of the most expensive acquisitions of CEZ, which have its popular shade and the whole landscape.
Then between the regions, Olomouc knows.
On the contrary, the slightest interest is about a remote station in the border, for example in Bohemia or in the Prachatics, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
Only in the first half of this year came 1274 new e-cars.
In a comprehensive survey of the “Cheese in Movement”, eight percent of readers said that the purchase of electric cars in the family was considered.
Only a third of respondents, however, know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better keeping the water.
Environmentalists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's current steps in the protection and healing of the Czech landscape and in addressing the climate crisis are insufficient, speakers called for a more flexible approach.
Actions called The Last Drop were attended by representatives of major organizations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace or Green Party, as well as smaller local communities.
"We have here, for example, people who go out for a long time against the expansion down to the Tours, here are people who go out against the demand for the skating of the Uher Ostrog, here are people who go out against the construction of unwise overhauls," said the organizers of Marik Wolf.
It stated that the main requirements for protesting are the creation of a plan for the retention of water in the region, the rapid change in agricultural policy and the system of support for sustainable agriculture and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
"The government is supposed to raise people's interests, not indiscriminate and devastating business," she said.
A station with a petition calling for a Czech State representative was located in Malostranské to regulate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech soil and landscape.
Present-day people were equipped with transparency with passwords like "End of Rape Deployment" or "Minimum Coal, More Men".
From South Moravia to Prague, Jan Škoda from the company came for water for the people who protested against the plan of schirkopic exercise in Hodoninsk.
"He threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that gardens represent the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned shearing effort is only about 500 metres from the garden and according to the judgements, it is certain that the water quality will be compromised.
The so-called agro-ecological farmer came from the village of Valeč to Karlovarsk Vojtěh Vesely.
He pointed out the mistakes of small farmers who were reluctant to earn their income and stockpiles directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, while not finding such a loss in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.

The owner is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the central and eastern European banking market.

We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtech said in ČT.
The so-called semafor, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red color according to the risk of coronavir.
The Minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual countries.
He assumed that only Moravskosleslez country would have orange color at the moment and would be close to Prague.
There will also be individual measures on the map for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtich said.

The duration of most diseases is low, only three percent of patients are infected in the hospital.
Whether the Czech Republic is spreading a smaller form of coronavir, or the summer dose of the sun significantly improved immunity.
The infection department of the patients is half-empty, even though the numbers are infected with growth.
"This situation today and in April is quite different and it is given primarily to the number of hospitalized," confirmed the Minister of Health Adam Vojtich.
It is worth noting that on April 11th, when the first wave of the epidemic struck, all the pigs carried, the samples carried out by the army, the Republic was closed, and the Czechs used disinfection for the year ahead.
Even so, ten people died daily.
Now the number of people infected is higher daily, but every day with covid-19, they die up to two people.
The highest number of people affected by the population still has Karvinsko, and the same numbers already have Jihlava due to the fire in the local Alzheimer's centre, where 57 people are already infected - 40 customers and 17 employees.
Another house for seniors was closed by the hygienics in Montenegro in the Royal Garden.
The malaise confirmed the tests at one of the nurses.
"We are searching, we have limited movement, we have all hygiene measures," said the home director Martin Skaněl.
According to him, none of the clients at home have any signs of disease yet.
General tests will begin with hygiene tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
The increased number of infected is also reported in hospitals.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which knows if people have ingested chicken.
The record is reported by Yugoslav hygienics who recorded fifty cases of coronavir - most of them constitute foreign employees of the labor company.
Overall, there were 131 people infected on Saturday - half the number of Fridays - but less is being tested on the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh dopsal my beach, Andersona smetl
The big surprise tournament on behalf of Dimitri van den Bergh also performed an excellent performance in the fight with the player, who won the second most prestigious company in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was bilaterally balanced, the crash became 8:7 for the Belgian sniper.
Van den Bergh has taken a handful of 13 chips and since then has had a cover.
His opponent literally shook his game and the much more experienced "Flying Scott" was only hard to get to the doubles.
The way she had "the Creator of Dreams" in her hand, it also testifies that the angry Anderson played its first maximum until the 24th leg.
Moreover, the young Belgian has managed excellent high checkouts.
Last time he lost in the eleventh leg, in a bad condition, but "he caught a big fish" and shut down 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson saw great frustration.
He was more than just throwing his fists, and after his triumphing rival, he was totally sovereign.
Van den Berg changed immediately the first of the three darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The winning of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is more valuable for the Belgian sniper than it is his first winner.
It still pays so much that the last player who managed to beat Van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
Nantes was charged with the fire of the cathedral, a man confessed.
The cathedral of Saint Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began burning on Saturday, and the fire seriously damaged the original windows of the 16th century and destroyed the guards.
The investigators ’ suspicion of burning was verified by the fire that the temple was being conducted from three different places.
At the same time, the police at the entrance found no sign of anyone being raped in the cathedral.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, a 90-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then she missed him without starting a criminal investigation.
The prosecutor now informed that on the basis of new evidence, a man was arrested again on Saturday, admitted and faced charges of fire.
If he's found guilty, he'll be threatened by a ten-year prison sentence and a high sentence.
According to his lawyer, the man is sorry for the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigator, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: On Monday we present "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is to play the role of the Pandemic Plan, for whose absence the government and the Ministry of Health is facing criticism.
"They will always be able to respond to community expansion," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravskoslej region or Prague would reach a middle, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional because the situation in each country is significantly different.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS).
At a single level, a specific measure will be imposed, according to the Minister, on the obligation to carry chickens or on the organisation of special wards in hospitals.
In order to create an epidemiological plan on the TV series, Prime Minister Jan Hamáček (CSSD) called on people to have clear information on what measures they could expect if the epidemiological situation worsened.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
The soldiers commented that there is nothing fundamental about reporting an extraordinary situation or re-calling a crisis staff.
The government, given the increasing number of people infected since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, has again imposed an obligation to wear chickens in internal actions of over 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited to 500 people, now making 1,000 people.
The government's process, when it was not clear to the last moment, what measures and when they started to pay, even when they were announced, came to criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should instead create a sense of security and the confusion rather compare," said Senator Marek Hilsher in Question Time.
The measures can now vary according to the region, for example, in Prague from Sunday, the obligation to carry cows also in non-resident medical facilities, for example in doctors or in doctor’s clinics.
The obligation to carry chickens during visits to health and social facilities or doctors was also introduced from Friday in the Liberian and Usteck countries.
At the University of Jihlava, there is a need to wear gloves in indoor public spaces, in MDDs and in health facilities since 14 July.
On the contrary, the anti-epidemic measures were released in the Moravian region, as well as in the Mediterranean region in Kuntnohorsk.
The Czech Government has also approved, at the beginning of June, a so-called ‘semafort’ for Europe, which colourfully distinguishes the level of the risk of the disease in individual European countries and accordingly amends the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from those countries.
In countries with low and moderate risk, the authorities from 15 June do not require a negative test on or instead of a quarantine test for the Czech citizens.
They are obliged to return to the Czechs from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category of disease.

The police have also solved 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the technoparty, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests on the presence of mind and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at work on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants wasn't reduced, the police would be there.
On TV, Prime Minister Jan Hamáček (CSSD) said this.
But the number of participants decreased by 1,000, the police assessed that the strike was not necessary, nor did they ask for a health care station or the Ministry of Health.
On Sunday, the Czech TV (CT) stated that the technoparties had also expanded to surrounding lands whose owners did not agree with the use of the technoparties.
It is possible that owners of surrounding lands will claim compensation for damage.
At Hlaváčkovy Lhoty's hole, the tech guests arrived on Friday night.
The police were looking at a hole in Blaži in Benešovsk on Friday, where technoparty took place last year.
The beach is about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčkova Lhota, where technicians have finally moved.
According to Novakov, no one came to Blaži.
Smashing the snake: The girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in the Iron Norse.
The snake has stabbed a girl, the year 2010 that parents themselves have brought to the dark base of the rescue service," said Danika, the country's spokesman for the health rescue service Mária Svobodová, by moving the child to the hospital in Klatov.
The snake is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in Shumave that these animals occur in a higher number, so it is good to be careful in walking.
No major danger, however, does not threaten these animals.
The chance that snakes will bite you is not too high, they're afraid of normal contact.
And if there's room for it, he likes to go away for loud drying.
It only attacks if you feel very threatened - for example when you miss it.
Not even her conception is a tragedy, but her poison is very effective against the little sages, but people don't die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
So the risk of danger is especially for children, seniors and allergies.
"A man often has a feeling of rejection after he has been stabbed, he is thirsty, has an increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in weakened individuals, and in particular allergies can come to anaphylactic shock," said Daník Miriam Gredová from Klatov Hospital.
The man threatened to throw the quay out of the window.

Sapa Store: Razie revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles going into the area carried 1320 pieces of celery eggs of unknown origin, in addition under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the slaughterhouse," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the living fish stand, it was found that the seller has no evidence of origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, last year in the autumn, the veterinarians discovered illegal food sales, with almost half a tonne of unmarked food without proof of origin.
In most cases, the date of consumption was not found, some of the products had a last durability period and were damaged.
At five kilograms of sepsis, the date of durability was exceeded by three years.
Last May, vets with policemen in the market area of 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, oil or frozen ducks, were held.
Putin telephoned Green before starting a business in Donbasa, Kreml criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he was supposed to start paying a new fee from midnight.
According to Kremlin's statement, among other things, he criticised the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kyev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of detainees.
In a new peace of mind, the Ukrainian and Russian negotiators agreed on Wednesday evening to support the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The average is to begin after midnight at midnight on Monday, be "full and general" and open the way for the further provisions of the peace agreements to be fulfilled.
Putin told the Greens in the debate that the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to organise local elections is in opposition to the peace agreement from Minsk and threatens prospects for the settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the elected elections to the local authorities would not be held in the territory of the Peruvian rebellion.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kyev will be regained under the control of Ukraine's occupied separatists with Russia after providing wide autonomy to these regions and organising local elections here.
According to the Union Agency’s Green Office, the two states agreed on the benefits of the upcoming Donbasa, and on the need to take further measures to support peace in this region, such as the abolition of the fighting areas or the decommissioning of part of the units from the front.
Zelena also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, on the occupied peninsula of Crimea and Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement has helped to stop the fights, however, in occasional shootings and gunshot attacks on both sides of the front, people continue to die.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 dead since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow rejects.
Since the end of the war in Donbas, Zelensky has made his priority a major breakthrough in the negotiations, but has not yet arrived.
The unexpected master in the tenth is Rykl, the seventh ruler of Novotná
The winner of the last two titles Inejal did not arrive at the conclusion of the Saturday programme of the quarter, Kopecky did not jump the base on Sunday.

Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside MČR, this time he was the only ten soldiers who reached across the seven-month border.
Other medals followed by William Straský and Petr Urbanek.
After the competition, he recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helceleta and Jiří Sykora.
"It's a shame that there weren't guys here and Kope didn't set up because those results would look completely different.
But the title tastes very well, I especially appreciate the fact that I gave myself a person about 30 centimeters away.
Then I was still happy with the point and the most disappointed me was the disc, I was half-way there," he admitted on the federal facebook.
On the first day of the seven-year-old she won with more than a hundred weight of Katerina Cach, although she suffered a wounded leg injury.
In the remote sector, however, it then wrote only 570 cm, did not exceed 40 metres and did not enter the final eight.
The novel collected 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Catherine Dvořákov.
She's out of the way, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it was around 630.
Yesterday I started to pull a trigger, but I'm so glad I didn't feel it and that it didn't even limit me," Novotná said on the federal facebook.
To the Czech Republic bio LPG, promises organic operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a very well-known alternative fuel in Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its mainly lower price against petrol or oil, a significantly lower consumption tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like gasoline and oil, it also has its ecologically safe option - "bio LPG".
However, it is all news - first the presentation was made on the European market and a few days ago, according to a press release by the Czech LPG Association.
"In these days we received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed in combination with classical fossil LPG at our pumping station," says Jiří Karlík's association from Primagas.
However, bioLPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biopetroleum.
According to the association, the chemical site is consistent with the classic oil LPG, which in its cars is now tanking up a number of motorists.
That's why it's also possible to mix both versions at any rate.
"The only difference to classical LPG is the production method," says Bio LPG Ivan Indraček, president of the association.
This is also said to be one of the major advantages of LPG against other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, for example compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from residues of food and sugar beet.
In the future it should also be produced with a target, e.g. from cellulose biomass, that is, from wood waste.
On the other hand, classical oil LPG is produced partly as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly separately in the extraction of natural gas.
The result is, therefore, based on the production technology and the source of the operation of the car on the bio LPG by 40-70% ecologically cleaner from the point of view of the carbon footprint than the operation on the oil LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
But it's not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, it's about fuel production, so it's called the "well-to-tank" part (Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest producers of the LPG currently belongs to petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan for Pure Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol examines the possibility of production and company in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the Czech Association's estimates, about 170 thousand LPG vehicles are driving; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in the NAP ČM, about 200 thousand.
According to the Ministry of Transport statistics, almost 6 thousand car stops were carried out on the LPG drive only last year.
Natankovat LPG is available in Czech Republic for approximately 950 different operators.
The troops reviewed the number of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
The Minister of Health Adam Vojtech (at the UN) ordered the Ministry to review the number of coronavir-infected viruses.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
Sunday afternoon the number dropped from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is less infected by 1775.
At present, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"In the wake of the increase in the number of people being treated, a revision of the data that the hygiene authorities have not been trying to update recently," said the chief of health statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were charged with coronavir, 11,419 were cured and 371 were unfortunately subjected to Covid-19 diseases.
Mobile election units or corresponding election.
Politologist and sociologist were looking for variants for a period of pandemic
According to the Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáčka (CSSD), a change of law is required in order to allow people in quarantine to vote in the October and Senate elections for coronavir.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in a rapid regime.
He introduced it on Sunday at Prima's TV party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss a possible solution with the representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Let's do anything, it's going to have to mean a change in election law," Hamaček said.
The Senate called on the government on Wednesday to find solutions under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that there would be a need to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of their health status.
The prohibition of choice should be maintained for example for patients with open-label tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop, in the OVM series, stated that the possibility of a corresponding election is being postponed since 2004.
And the current bill, which is in the locker room, then counts with its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, the poll considers the concerns of the UN or the ČSSD (because it would, according to experience from abroad, rather record other types of parties) from the corresponding election as overestimated.
It is, in particular, against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klima said that it is now necessary to develop ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be achieved by this year and at least at the health risk.
The main point is to be prepared for the year 2021 when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
The corresponding choice (whether in foreign or Czech) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As yet, they see the election units already mentioned, or possibly the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it was possible to learn how similar situations - the elections at the time of the coronavir - were resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
As a result of the spread of coronavir infections, various types of elections have been postponed in 67 countries in the world.
Protests in Bulgaria: The pig's ears threw demonstrators at the government building
The participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borisov and his cabinet were attacking the building of the pig's government.
It was another of a series of protests against the "mafian style of government", which has been playing in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organisers are planning a state-wide blockade, the DPA agency has set up.
Today's protest, which has taken place since 18 days later, has had worse participation than previously, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom.
At 8:00 a.m., about 300 people met, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators before the building government staged a theatre scene where they symbolically confined Prime Minister Boris and Attorney General Ivan Gesche in connection with the arrest of two councillors of President Rumen Radeva, who is a strong political opponent of the government.
Both resignations are part of the basic requirements of Protestants.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption during construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of protests Nikolai Hadzigen today announced in a public declaration that on Wednesday there is going to be a "top-top escalation" in the form of a "celon national demonstration in Sofia and blockade throughout the country".
He reiterated the demand for Boris' resignation and his government, as well as the election of the early elections.
The proper ones should be made in March 2021.
Borisov already told me he wasn't going to resign.
It also justified the need to carry out the Bulgarian pandemic of covid-19 and resulting from the economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he exchanged five members of his government team, whether the protestant's resignation had calmed down.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government stopped voting in parliament about confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlović doesn't want any more games without spectators
Football coach Boloni Siniš Mihajlović already has enough matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian visitor hopes that since the new season, fans will return to the stadium.
"What we're currently operating here is not football.
I already have the teeth of a fight without the spectators.
It's a free football, it doesn't give me any emotion, no joy.
Those fights are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that," Mikhajlovic told me before today's fight against Lecce.
After the coronavir break, the series A matches in the fast track, and although they play until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible weather.
In such a situation, they don't even know how the teams are on it.
It's time for this season to end.
These measures had to be taken to win the competition, but I hope that since September the fans will be back," said the visitor, who in the past led Fiorentin or AC Milan.
For Mihajlovice, this season is also unusual because he was missing four months on the toilet due to leukemia treatment.
"In spite of my illness, the break-in of the league, and all the others, our team managed to move up high.
We want to continue to grow and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We've become the target of the cyberattack of foreign states, hard Iran.
Since the end of June, fires and explosions and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear installations, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranians reported that a fire that broke out this month in the underground nuclear power plant in Natanz could cause cyber sabotage.
The reason for the series of other incidents has not yet been explained.
The Iranian ministry's speech foreign to Iranian media reporters Abbas Musáví said that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic is facing "thousands of cyberattacks" daily.
He added that it's not about a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to reflect.
In recent months, according to the Musávi, a number of wider cyber attacks have been recorded, followed by the analysis of "certain governments and groups".
However, Reuters did not report any further details about possible perpetrators.
The museum also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in summer.
This month, the Iranian state agency's article discussed that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the United States, could be behind recent incidents.
Not one of these countries has been directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic contacts shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the US Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans for 444 days.
The long-term tension between the two countries was severed in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran, which have a serious impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the American army killed the Iranian General Kassema Solejmanja and member of the leader of the Iraqi militia Abu Mahdí Muhandise on 3 January.
Iran then fired on 8 January at the base in Iraq, where the American is acting, a lot of rockets.
The United States refused to accept that tens of U.S. soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its criminal enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main supporter of the international nuclear agreement with Iran in 2015.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran rejects.
The TPCA car has extended the production delay, now until 25 May
Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) was once again extended by the production delay due to coronavir.
Production lines should be relaunched on Monday, 25 May morning.
The race will accompany dozens of hygienic measures, said the speakers cars Tomáš Paroubek.
The production is due to the pandemic of coronavir since the 18th of March.
The company originally intended to renew it on Monday 18 May.
The reason why the delay is extended is Paroubka's closed limit and closed dealership, so no one has to sell the car.
According to Paroubka, the company will be producing 100 per cent from the beginning, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavir is a company's key markets, such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the production gap in the TPCA is not signed for life in the city.
"At first it was known, it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are filled, especially since Monday, when it's a lot of fun.
So the city is full," Kashpar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed in their accommodations.
"In those two months we didn't have to solve almost no problem," Kaspar said.
For example, a young boulevard Car, which also disrupted production due to the coronavir crisis, renewed it on Monday 27 April in all three of its production races in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the races works for 100 percent of the capacity.
The restoration of production in Scotland has accompanied more than 80 hygienic measures.
At night from Monday to Tuesday, in Mladé Boleslava and Kvasinás, the first time the production was restored was the third, i.e. the night shift.
In the TPCA, about 2,500 people are currently working and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employer in Cologne.
Cancer killed a bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to her family
More than two years ago, she was struggling with the congenital cancer of Gemma Sisson, and once it seemed that cancer was defeated, the disease came back.
A nine - year - old woman who loved culturalism ended up in a hospital bed where she still had enough to take her life’s love.
Unfortunately, I'm sorry.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her social network facebook for the closest.
Gemma Sisson, from English Leeds, loved culture.
With a friend of Rick Moor, who lived with him for more than 16 years, they traveled through competitions around the world.
Ninety-year-old woman sported and lived healthy, although she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, hoping to heal.
After months of treatment it really seemed that Gemma had succeeded in winning cancer, but in August 2019 cancer returned and this time attacked five.
A culturalist and personal coach, according to the British daily Mirror, underwent a ten-hour operation of the pantheon and then again started a drastic treatment.
Of course, everything was empty.
At the beginning of this year, at her 90th birthday, her doctors told her that she had a few months left.
In April, a blonde woman finally decided to go to a hospital in Leeds, where she visited her family every moment, who even arranged for her wedding with her love Ricky.
Marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant last two months at their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, on her social network account, she came across a contribution that Gema wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I'm gonna have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I'm so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who was on my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social network followers," she wrote, saying that everyone should respect his life and live it fully.
Machines for art sell travel list, amulet from mushrooms and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, a clumsy pocket work is obtained by most starting Czech artists.
Images and other creations create directly for artifacts, so they know that they have to go up to 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Every piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always curator text about the artist and then work alone," answered the curator of the Petra Widžová project.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
The buyer can thus be surprised by what art works.
At present, it may be necessary to become the new owner of the fantastic illustrations of Alexandra Stoplov or miniviews from Teresa Bonavourto, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Dutko prepared a pexeso associated with the Prague Pass.
The cards should be marked with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrova and Juliana Chomová sell a bag of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the pregnant woman and a flashcard, the second series of illustrations from her comic book Spiritist.
Payments in health next year will grow by up to five percent.
The higher the rise, according to Vojtecha, is unrealistic
Payments in health care could increase by up to five per cent in the next year, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (at the UN) in Questions Václav Moravce on Czech TV.
The expert requirement for an increase of up to 15 per cent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-contained in the provision of protective aid.
According to him, they now have their resources.
"I think that growth (payments) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation where, since March, it has reached the selection of the insurance pandemic of coronavir and the government regulation against its spread.
The insurance receipts fell back at the time.
"I'm going to have an increase of 15 percent at this point in real time," Vojtech said.
The average monthly benefit of physicians in acute bed care according to the date of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the payment of a sister in state hospitals and the rent of other contractors will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data from ÚZIS also shows that the remains of nurses in hospitals have been stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34 125 kroner in 2019 according to the date of the Czech Statistical Office.
Representatives of the experts have already stated in June that for 2021 they will require a minimum increase of 10 per cent, ideally 15 per cent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the benefit of doctors and the sister in state hospitals, which must be managed by payment tables and contractual wages in hospitals, cities or countries or private ones.
Therefore, they also require that the pay tables be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, in doctors last year, wages grew faster than payments.
According to the President of the Czech dental chamber Roman Šmucler, the experts should consider the current state of affairs.
Recently, because of the impact of the epidemic, the covid has approved an increase in the state budget for the record of 500 billion crowns this year, of which 1.75 billion is expected to be paid by doctors in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Health Care Providers according to Šmucler does not agree to a flat-rate payment visit next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals themselves and the medical facilities and the money should also go through the payroll.
The soldiers also stated that hospitals currently have a lot of protective help.
The President of the Administration of State Stock Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not have any health assistance at the moment.
He's waiting for the completion of the selection process.
According to Vojtěch, now suppliers in the world are able to deliver goods better than in March when they were bought.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and to buy from Czech companies as well.
The trembling wise quarantine could take over the soldiers.
We're ready, they say.
"The smart quarantine works, it's something to improve, of course.
We'll discuss with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly, and it is a question of whether they should not drive it all again," the president of the government said on Sunday in his facebook series, the people.
According to it, it is not sufficient to connect IT systems and hygiene stations, which must gradually switch to more modern working methods.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister in Moravskosleske, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
The defence ministry spokesperson Jan Pejšek for the ČTK stated that there was no information on the Sunday discussion and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step, according to him.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantine team was led by a 90-year-old central management team, established under the army as a government advisory body, led by former ministers of mayor Roman Primula.
The moving project on Sunday was criticised by the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (CSSD).
And he insisted that the army could take him back.
The lack of resources in the project has previously allowed a government agent for IT and digitisation of Vladimir Dzurilla, who is concerned about it.
"The system works, but it's still working.
Twenty years have come about by itself and in a system that we are now trying to unite within a few months.
It's not a trick.
People on the move, the poor on the hygiene on the move, adapt the new systems and actually catch the mistakes," he said.
Macura's island prime minister won't run again, so he doesn't want to "get involved in politics"
The current island prime minister Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in future municipal elections.
The reason is the effort "not to be fooled by politics," the server said to Respect.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the presidency of the UN Movement, has been the Prime Minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, it received a leading candidate for the movement of the UN in Ostrava of nearly one third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in function for only four years.
"I told myself that I would endure one functional period, and with that business experience, I could put everything back and put it on my feet," said Respect.
He added that during the second election period, he was allowed to talk to a certain extent.
"But it's the maximum for me.
I don't want to be a fool in this policy," Macura added, who in the interview marked himself as a heavy introvert, which is not a frequent contact with people.
According to the Respect, there has been speculation for a long time about the possible end of Macro in the motion of the UN.
The server recalls that Macura has criticised the motion of the UN several times, for example for connecting to the motion of the SPD or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few ANO personalities, he supported Zeman’s opposition candidate Jiří Drahos in his election.
Macura does not plan to leave from the UN movement to which she entered in 2017.
"If I feel that I can change something in motion, that it's not a completely empty fight and that no one bothers me, I have no immediate motive to end it," said Respect.
Sixteen-year-old Macura studied at the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming an island prime minister in 2014, Macura acted, inter alia, as director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He's also settled in other companies' organs.
To Brno returns Uber offering transport services
At the end of July, Uber will return to Brno, which offers transportation services.
This is the result of the amendment of the law, he stated on Thursday in the press release of the Brno Council for the Transport of Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
Against Uberu in Brno, the taximen protested, pointed out that Uber does not meet conditions such as a taxi or a taxometer.
However, the amendment of the Act changed the conditions for the operation of ordinary taxis and of the alternative ones since July.
Over the past few weeks, he has been conducting several discussions with representatives of Uber.
"On their basis, this company decided at the end of July this year to return with its services to Brno.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber acted in Brno in the past.
Taxirs protested against him because of the non-marking of vehicles as a taxi or a missing taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary measure which prevented Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported the taxi driver, last year at the end of the year, but Prime Minister Markét Vaňková (ODS) stated that the city would want to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to subsequent court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
Now he's coming back on the basis of a change of law.
In addition to the classic taxis, it has been argued from July that it is easier to operate the transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too loud a celebration in Brno: the flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
From the fourth floor of the apartment she flew out on Saturday night in Brno's office chair and got about a meter from the hallway.
He was followed by a walker who called the guards immediately.
As soon as she arrived at that address in the western part of the city, she noticed an open window under which she was still lying in the chair and next to several backrests and non-slips.
"The hand, which moved from the room at the fourth floor, indicated that a relatively loud celebration is being performed inside.
The officers left after walking to the apartment and asked three young men from the age of sixty to ninety years for an explanation," spokespersons Jakub Ghan told them.
Request for withdrawal Rafaje will prove Babish with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss a request on Monday with coalition social democrats on the proposal to revoke the head of the Anti-Monopolitan Office (UOHS) Petra Rafaje.
The Rafajes called for non-profits to act against the anti-corruption council of the government and also the Uztec country.
Social Democrats state that the exchange in front of the Office is on the ground.
According to the CHK Rafaj, on Monday, he was not invited to the Government's Office.
The second mandate will end in half next year, according to the law, it cannot be appointed a third.
His resignation is within the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the call for non-profits, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar requirement from the Ústeck region.
They're supposed to be outside of Rafaj's cause for the last time.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to make a request by getting acquainted with the materials and the government's views on this.
He also stated that he had not yet dealt with the president, that he had no meeting with him as soon as possible.
According to UOHS, there is no reason why Rafaj was not accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Actually.cz wrote last week that the police were interested in Rafaj's meeting with the Heitman Jiři Čink.
Meetings were related, inter alia, to the decision on competition for the project of a controversial new clinic of eight billion zines, which the Chungek strongly promotes.
The boy admitted to the meeting, according to him, they jointly resolved his "memorial activities".
So does Rafaj.
The Republic of Austria's representative for the withdrawal of Rafaje called for the government at the end of June.
It also calls for the reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of the OHHS on public contracts according to the Heitman's address for the transport of Jaroslav Komínka is not transparent and has signs of discretion.
Last March, the police raided the antitrust office for a myth-choice tender.
This year in June, the server Aktuálno.cz pointed out that Rafaj is using the apartments written on the company of the influential back-up player ČSSD Alexandra Chuby.
The stay of 3.5 million per apartment in Brno was paid from Rafa's account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition, Rafaj, has appointed, for the second term of office, the President of the former Member of Social Democracy in June 2015.
In a few years' time, Rafaj's second sixth mandate will be fired.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it does not function for a period of more than six months or seriously distorts the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the office.
In the Blanca library, the workers were collaborating.
Helps with air conditioning
The new technique will be 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in downtown Blanca regularly.
In warm months, however, it was practically impossible to survive.
There was terrible air and bad air.
Wind didn't help.
That's why I like climate change," said one of the Lebanese readers Petr Novotny.
According to the director of the Lukás Dlapa Library, temperatures in the building have often spread over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the object is soaked and in the sundays it works as a glass.
"The sun also supports much of the day thanks to the curve of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem for the individual department to explore because it has to be closed overnight for safety reasons.
This is how often we have been in the library since morning to thirty degrees," Dlapa said.
The worst was the studio and the basement on the third floor.
And then the four-storey showrooms and the director's office.
The pleasant climate was also in the children’s department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that the librarians at work were collaborating and ended up in a job failure.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures that visit dozens of people.
After a few minutes, there was no breathing there," Dlapa noted.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to make air-conditioning this year in all areas of the library.
In the end, there will be only three circles of five.
"Because of limited funding, climateisation will only have the most problematic areas.
The studio and the basement on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department on four floors," Jiří Svoboda of the Lebanese Investment Committee informed.
He added that in the first phase, workers in the autumn had installed air technology and adjusted the electricity installation.
About 360 thousand crowns.
The city library Blanco has three thousand registered readers.
It's about nine hundred to fifteen years.
The Chicago resistance has eliminated the coronavirus.
Crawford returns to the game
Not every infected sportsman will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who keep silent about the state of the players as a grave and does not disclose anything at all.
As one of the few came out of the Crawford series.
A 15-year-old relative from Montreal was present only on the first training course, since then he had been missing in the assembly.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positively on Covid-19 and that is why I spent the last fourteen days locked in my home," explained the reason for my absence.
Fans don't have to be afraid of his condition anymore.
Crawford is ready to go back to full load.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible," I added.
The experienced golman has won with Chicago two Stanley Cupy, a solid part of the branch is already the tenth season in a row.
Blackhawks is waiting for the first ready duel with St. Louis, then they'll be in front of Edmonton.
Thousands protested in Israel against the Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu solves the crisis.
The demonstrations were performed outside of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants demand Netanyahua's resignation because of the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government solves another wave of the epidemic of coronavir.
"Baby, go home," the AP agency wrote one of the demonstrators to his transparency, referring to Netanyahu's generally known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," he stood on the other side.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is Israel's first prime minister sentenced to office.
He is accused of three causes of corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust.
All charges are rejected and marked by a witch hunt.
According to local media, the process can take up to three years, over 300 witnesses are called.
Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, by a total of 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced a quarantine measure that helped reduce daily increases in infected people.
After the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, but in particular the end of the number of red infected again began to rise significantly.
Netanyahu's criticism claims that the government has not helped enough, for example, the survivors affected by quarantine measures.
The Protestant also blames the fact that the government in the fight against coronavir issues disproportionate instructions.
The driver broke the tree car and died.
The body had to cut off the fires from the back.
A tragic accident took place around 23 hours at Neveklov for a narrow period leading from the Slapska crossing.
The driver must have flew at a low speed down to the woods and smashed the car about the tree.
He's dead in the place.
The body had to fire the fires out of the back, including cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being examined by the police.
They ordered a drink that should explain, in addition to others, whether a man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other conventional substances.
End with the spitting and scratching of one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi breaks down and betting on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and leaves itself with a fundamental change in the strategy.
He's moving down and he doesn't want to scratch one collection after another.
The fact that fashion industry is one of the biggest environmental pollutants is not new.
There are billions of pieces of clothing in the ovens and warehouses every year.
Look at slow fashion, often distorted access to clothing, but in recent years it has changed relatively quickly.
About half of Peter Filipi’s goods were sold at a full price.
The second half, which was sold by discounts, will simply not buy.
The company does not want to grind one collection at a time and at the end of each season produce at their production price.
In addition, according to the owner of Michala Mitchky, the time of new and old collections and blind follow-up is rapidly changing fashion trends.
"Most retailers are already counting on the purchase of goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a fraud," says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Micka.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Every product is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We stress that a large part of our collection is made of so-called basic pieces - that is, clothes that are overtime and overseasonal.
Worldwide is a segment of the premium marks of any profession typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," Micka adds.
The large graffiti represents the flight of the RAF Kurt Taussiga
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our racing pilot fighting in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was popular with city management," Vacek, who finished his work after fourteen days of intensive creation, said.
He consumed about 300 litres of color and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplích-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
For his Jewish origin, he was taken to an international camp where he was kept for weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid concentration camps because of Nicholas Winton's organization.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) and later graduated from pilot training in South Africa and Palestine.
He joined the war operations in early 1945.
After the Soviet revolution, he visited Czech and native Teplice several times, which gave him an honest citizenship.
The 60-year-old Kamil Vacek, known as Camo in the street art industry, has been working for over 20 years.
The graffiti began on the premises that the former Prime Minister Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) had set up for these purposes.
Borreh Hanna reached the coast of Texas
Hurikán Hanna arrived on the southwestern coast of the American state of Texas on Saturday afternoon (before midnight SELC tonight).
He hit the texa island Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and when he moved on to the fortress, he was weakened by a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a major threat to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
He brought with him strong winds and intense strikes; with local floods, electrical accidents and various material damage were reported by the AP agency, including damaged ships.
The governor of Texas Greg Abbott announced a state of natural disasters on Saturday for 32 periods in Southeast Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The most powerful warning was received by people from the coastal band between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay Bay, but he had to live to reach the area nearly 500 kilometers long before moving gradually over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hannah is now a tropical storm, strong rains and winds, rising colds, a dangerous cycle and a single tornado can pose a threat," warned the American National Centre for Hurricanes (NHC).
This morning, local time (SELČ afternoon) was moving in the US-Mexico border and accompanied by an wind speed of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hannah became the first hurricane this year in the Atlantic region on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, a wind of up to 145 kilometers an hour [145 km] was carried through, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers an hour in the process, which made Hannu out of the Hurricane category again.
Local authorities called for storms to cross the house and not forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas is one of those American states that has the highest incidence of covid-19.
In view of the current security measures and the need to comply with the derogations, there is a great challenge and possible evacuation.
The screenings were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the texa period, Hidalgo was also adapted to one of the buildings as a layer after evacuation, which had a positive test on the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on all evacuated to take chickens and disinfectants with them in hiding, if possible.
"We don't even have that far behind us.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted AP Chrise Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville.
The predictions say that in some places it would be possible to pump up to 300 millimeters of precipitation for a few hours, in some cases 500 millimeters of waterless, which together with the sea level could flood a number of seabeds on the coast.
Zeman loans the general value of Colonel Lipkovi
President Milos Zeman will loan Colonel Paul Lipkovi's general worth on Wednesday.
This results from a review of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for lending the value of the Brigadier General is July's approach to the post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance's multinational division northeastern Poland.
July has thus far acted as a representative of the commander of the earthly forces of the Czech army.
Zeman's promotion at the end of June was proposed by the government.
July since the beginning of August, Brigadier General Karl Röhk will be replaced by the Deputy Commander of the multinational division northeastern Poland, who will lead the units of the Alliance's pre-occupational presence in the territory of Poland and Poland.
In March, Greece became the Director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NUKIB).
The government has proposed to the president that Lipkov borrow the value of the Brigadier General.
According to the Warrants Act, a higher value may be borrowed by a soldier for the duration of the vacancy or for the period of performance of the service task which requires a higher value loan.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division corresponds to the general value.
The soldier to whom the value was lent has the same rights and obligations as if he were appointed to this value.
However, he has no claim to modify the payment that would correspond to the values.
A loan of value takes into account the reason why it was granted to him.
"Col. Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
A significant contribution is made to the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence stated in June to the proposal for an increase.
The median increase will take place at 12:30 in the Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomir Metnar or Chief of General Staff Ales Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for aircraft travel, which are designed to reduce the spread of new coronavir.
It was announced by the German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards are the maintenance of the departure or carrying of chickens in the aeroplane and at the airport, but the average seats in the aeroplanes will not have to remain unencumbered.
She reported that agency Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The measures agreed include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from six years of age, to comply with the recommended departure from safety checks and landing at the airport.
The aircraft must also provide fresh air and all information must be available in a number of languages.
Aeroplanes will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules on which the officials have agreed shall meet at least certain requirements of the airlines.
Different standards were the cause of confusion.
In the Arctic Spicberkas, the temperature record fell, and they measured almost 22 degrees.
"In Longyearbyen, 41-year-old record fell," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute stated on Twitter.
During the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, with a record of 0.4 degrees higher than 1979.
The cave of two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in the Spicberkas, located about 1,300 kilometers from the north pole.
Spicbers heat faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other continents of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, the last report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies states.
The average temperature in the Spicbergs, according to it, grew from the 1970s to the 20th century by three to five degrees.
By 2100, even ten degrees can be reached if greenhouse gases are not released into the atmosphere.
Temperature growth in Spicberka may result in permanent freezing of frozen soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and may cause even greater quantities of lava and soil sesuvius.
The warming of the climate also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or turtles, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Brits who come back from Spain are waiting for a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British government has also called for the risk of spreading covid-19 disease to be avoided by all roads to the mainland of Spain, which are not necessary.
So the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but after their return, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules shall enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomat stated in his statement.
"We have always made it clear that, if it is necessary, we will immediately remove certain countries from the list of safe ones," she added.
As noted in the British Letter Metro, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of British people.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British are also concerned that they will be paid sickly if they will have to end up on 14 days in isolation after their return from the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne had a ten-week vacation at Lanzarote, they had to leave on Tuesday.
They've been ordered since December.
"We had a whole family, my wife Amanda and the daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a mechanic, and I don't think my employer will agree that I will be back from the vacation two weeks in quarantine," quoted the journal Metro Hunter.
In relation to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the last two days, there have always been over 900 newly infected people within 24 hours.
Offices in some areas have already introduced coronavir measures, such as Catalan trying to limit all night life and prevent people from meeting at large.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out the increased risk of diseases in Catalonia, Aragonia, Basque and the Madrid area.
Model purchase of electricity from Dukovan government
On Monday, the government will discuss the model of purchasing electricity from the planned new nuclear power plant Dukovany.
The proposal for a law shall be based on the fact that, in the case of a purchase price higher than the market price of a power plant, the difference shall be paid to all consumers by means of tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be different.
The power plant is an unregulated part of the final price of the electricity for the receivers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for the UN) and the CEZ Energy Company have previously stated that the most likely option is that people will save their electricity building.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term market price outlook of electricity is always not true, which has shown developments in the past several times.
The target has been criticizing environmental organizations before.
"The purchase price can be both under the market price of the power plant and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact varies between customers according to the size of the insurer - at lower consumption or at higher electricity consumption - at higher consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) stated in the materials base.
The Havlíček in May stated that it assumes that the wholesale price of electricity will grow and the people at Dukovan build.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns per family per year, which it considers to be far less than people pay every year in electricity invoices to support so-called supported resources.
Previously, it was estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (approximately 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatthodin (MWh).
The material in question does not contain any proposal for an amount, should be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, at which traders are now the most stocked, is currently around 45 euros (approximately 1190 CZK) for MWh.
"In contrast to the cost and market prices of the power plant up to ten euros, it could make an average household allowance with 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four-year households, standardly equipped with electric consumers including electric safety boards and pipes, but which does not use electricity for heating and heating hot water - not full 100 CZK/year," wrote in the foundation for the MPO government.
"We live in an unscrupulous time.
Pandemie coronavir has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecast of market prices to be a speculative issue," TCC said the former executive director of the Energy financial group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law is calculated by means of a purchase of MPO, respectively, by a legal person owned by the State at a pre-established price.
The contract between the investor and the State, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated, however, as long as the low carbon production is completed.
The low carbon production design is defined as a production power with a nuclear reactor connected to the electrical system with installed capacity with a minimum power output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
The Havlíček earlier stated that the new Dukovan block should have a power of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthours of electricity annually, corresponding to ten expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into service in 2036.
The model of financing a new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed without charge during construction, accounting for a two-percent increase in operation.
The financing model does not agree with the opposition, it also suggests the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The State should share 70 per cent in the building.
The balance should be paid to the CEZ company, which will also build all possible additional costs.
CEZ Director-General Daniel Benès said in May CZK that the expected amount for building a block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion kroner).
The agreements between the State and the Czech Republic on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has downloaded tourism support material in the media for two billion
Material that the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to lose in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on a holiday in Czech Republic of two billion crowns, was withdrawn from the notice.
Minister Klara Dostalová (for the UN) server List of messages.cz said that the material is still working.
The eKlepu document (electronic library of the legislative process) was notified on Friday by the Zdrogry.cz server.
The Ministry of the Plan justified the loss of traffic due to coronavir.
During the coronavir crisis, there was a loss of income and the media.
The proposal sparked criticism of the opposition and the representatives of the travel movement.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website, MMR was planning to provide public agencies to support the travel of CzechTourism money on advertising on television, advertising, printing, on the Internet, billboards or stations.
The biggest part of the money, that's 700 million crowns to get TV.
Most people would get private TVs from Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weeklys would get 400 million and the same part would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the websites.
The advertising stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which are private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and platforms on stations or in meters.
The campaign to support travel in the Czech Republic should start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still working, certainly not in the form that should be presented," said Dostalová without any further details on the List of Messages server.
The material criticised the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markets of Pekar Adam would profit from the advertising media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andreje Babis (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this apparent humiliation will take place in the fall in the choice of eye injury," she wrote on twitter.
It rejects the fact that it is actually aid to the media in the face of the crisis.
"It may even be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," said Danika N.
According to it, the budget is two billion indicative.
"Of course we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
Initiatively, saving tourism does not make sense media campaigns to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in travel, not the rest of the advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, president of the initiative on Sunday.
If those two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, write an initiative in an open letter from the government.
Life extract, beer boil and death as a grass stalk
He is also the third album entitled And death is the stem of the grass of the Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Friche, who also left the year before, on May 24.
In Frič's discography there is the fifth item, and as in previous titles there is also the main emphasis on Frič's poetry, which is the only outstanding interpreter.
Fear, the year 1949, was obviously influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration passed through its own personal experiences and also very bold expressions of faith.
However, he was far away from the dogs, talking or writing about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, totally tolerant.
I'm under attack in the context of Bohuslav Reynek (as opposed to Jan Zahradníkova), the masters will pass.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always been very sensitive to her, whether she was a cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Barton and Vítezslav Holata.
I help - I love - the words of the island poet Petra Hrušky about the long poem compositions.
"Salam of them is proud and unending bitterness," writes Hruška, "on the condition of our world threatened by contempt.
The world, which is becoming more and more repulsive in consummation and greed, is increasingly alienated from what his soul was created from the mystery of faith, humility, and human proximity.
They called out to those who knew that the values for which they were created were of little interest, but who also knew that only because of the general lack of interest can they not be disclosed.
The poems reminded me that a person may have to get rid of everything precious, but it is not inconceivable how it will happen.
If it is sold to a general collapse, skepticically rejects it, fearfully silences it, or remains to the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what it believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamaček
The former Prime Minister and President of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek are not a paid social democracy adviser.
The president and Minister of the Interior, Jan Hamaček, communicates with him only and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamaček said that today in the Prima Party TV series.
That Paroubek should be Hamáčka's advisor, the server informed the List of Messages.cz on Friday.
"From time to time we write an essay, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamaček said today.
He added, however, that it is not official and paid cooperation.
According to ČSSD, it does not have the means to fly for similar purposes.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, so many people like that," he said.
In the ensuing discussion with ODS MP Janu Montenegro's Minister said that many ODS members are still "indiscreetly listening to the views of Václav Klaus".
He thinks it's okay because it's about an experienced policy and the former president of the party, which is also Paroubka's case.
The fact that the media are making an affair is marked by this year's curry season.
Server ListMessages.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Hamak's informal consultant.
He also wrote that at the fourth place the party's candidate in the oral country was directed by a certain president of Peter Benda's cell that was connected to Paroubke and acted as vice president of his party LV 21.
Today, Hamaček said that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile ahead, he's a kick in his ass, he's a Swedish challenger.
The 22-year-old American printer has ambition and potential to be among the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to defeat the younger Duplantise, last year he beat her at the time of the Association of the University of NCAA.
"We had a battle a year ago, then he won, and I was the second, then we passed it.
In both cases it was a very good fight," describes Nilsen, who secured his victory with a performance of 5,95 meters.
Although, since then, Duplantis has fired a sharp upwards and is currently in the highest spheres of ink alone.
In just 20 years he became a world recordman, this February 8th in Toruni, he crossed a plane of 6,17 meters, added another centimeter a week later in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters in 18 years when he graduated from high school," recalls his cousin Nilsen for the World Sports web site.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up from a boy in a man, all his potential and talent would be ten.
Twenty years is a total good age to jump the world record," he thinks.
Being Nilsen's record of success is more accurate than knowing who is proud of Duplantis, the American is setting similar goals.
So far, he pointed out his options at the NCAA competitions, which he regularly won, this year in February, he developed an internal personal record at 5.93 m. In August, Loni won a gold medal in the Panamanian games in Lima, and in 2017, he fought for an American race on a world championship where he finished 13.
Then the closest lover for him is to taste the diamond league for the first time.
"It's my priority to get to the professional circle and race as much in the Diamond League as possible, because there you can make a name," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly take the same action as the Olympics, the world championships or the Panamanian games."
But because of the pandemic, these top-level celebrations are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other tickers time to improve.
But will this be enough to get Duplantise, which can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere silver fight?
"Everyone is trying to achieve it, but I don't think it will be possible as soon as possible," Nilsen says.
"That kid's been jumping for 16 years and he's got all the other miles in his training."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, she's gonna want to raise it.
A woman lost a statistician from her disabled son's retirement.
The court is waiting for her.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as an invalid income is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
A woman is threatened with a felony for eight years.
Because of his poor health, the court of the sick man of his right and his mother set up a guardian, who, among other things, was supposed to manage the money.
"A woman from mid-November 2013 to January 2013 used part of her son's disability pension funds for her own needs and prepared it for 440 thousand crowns," said police spokesman Dana Ladman, who complains that the accused woman was particularly obliged to avoid the interests of the injured.
The woman, as instructed by the court, arranged a bill for her son, because her income had been transferred to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of the son in the health care facility and the replacement of the necessary medicines, the remaining funds were used for the purchase of vehicles, electricity and household expenses," the complainant said.
That he can't use his son's money for his own needs, the woman admitted.
But she was shocked that she was helping them pay for their family expenses.
"We had problems from our income to avoid the homewalk.
We've never bought anything superstandard.
It was always on things his son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't realize that I would commit a criminal offence," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to pay her son back.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, hard scientists have found tools
The findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools from the army, including fine sharps that could have been used to cook meat, and spicy objects that could serve as caves of sheep or copper.
Scientists have found that the oldest instruments come from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this old man here.
But they are here," said the archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies published on this topic in Nature magazine.
The youngest tools are 12 500 years old.
According to experts, the people of Chiquihuite caves, located at a high altitude, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely recognized theory has said that the first representatives of the Homo sapiens type have crossed the fortress bridge from Russia to Alaska about 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique caves of copies used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this Clovis culture subsequently expanded in much of North America.
This model, however, has been achieved in the last decades of the market, when several old settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
In the second study published in Nature magazine, 42 different locations across North America have been reported, proving human presence on the continent from 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American fortress before it was supposed to.
Some could have gotten ships to America at the time.
"It is obvious that people were in America long before the development of so-called Clovis culture," declared an anthropologist Ruth Gruhn from the University of Canada in the province of Alberta.
So far, the interest in the airline is filling up an optimistic scenario, hard salesmen.
Prices also decrease gradually
He sells summers in the Czech Republic grow every week.
In contrast to last summer, there is still almost half interest, but demand increases by 20 percent every week.
According to the sellers, the post-crisis development fills the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of the aircraft are being gradually reduced.
Among the most sought-after destinations are according to sellers in particular to the South European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At the Portal Letuska.cz, the most sold flights to the Croatian Split.
From other countries, then, is the most sought after Great Britain, which, of course, always belongs to the most difficult destination.
The average price of flights is also reduced.
At the portal Letuska.cz, approximately half a month, around 6250 kroner, averaged 3,000 kroner less.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for a European destination, which now accounts for about 85 per cent of sales.
However, they also cut prices in some European places, such as Spain or Italy, by about five in the last few weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who now buy airplanes with much less than before, because they are afraid of further development of the coronary situation.
According to previous Kiwi.com information, the flight purchase time before departure was reduced by approximately ten days.
"It confirms our future trend when people order flights with a much smaller front, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice-President for Kiwi.com Michal Shindelář.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
The number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also rising with sales growth.
At Prague airport, regular lines are currently operating to more than 60 destinations.
It's about half the destination against last summer's season.
Big finals already tonight!
Follow the arrow battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC was completed at a large final.
It features an experienced nine-year-old Scottish skier Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, a six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson, in the first round, edited Justin Pip, then hit his neighbor in the table table.
James Wad, however, advised himself, and at the quarter-end, he had a strong argument with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home a world unit.
"Flying Scott" was in trouble in the semifinals when he was facing Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he ran away from the shovel, dominated in the long run, and after the result of 18:16 he fought a place in the final tournament, which he ruled already in 2018, when in the amazing battle he defeated Mensura Suljovice 21:19.
The biggest surprise World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps aware that it has nothing to lose, helped him to play on a totally fantastic wave.
The 16-year-old plumber first surprised the world’s sixth Nathan Aspinall, pressed Joe Cullen into a dramatic battle, and won Adrian Levise in a quarter-final.
A big check was semi-final.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the start, but then, in a calm Belgian series, he got a jump, which then kept him to the end without problems.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high score, which affected occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavir cases occurred at least from the beginning of the week, decreased the number of tests
Since the beginning of March, when the new coroner virus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has been reportedly infected by 15 212 people.
Nearly 9,600 of them have been treated, 368 patients have died.
At present, there are 5 254 people.
It comes from data on the Ministry of Health's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times two hundred.
Maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, there were positive 235 tested, the day before 246 and Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 were injured.
Out of the cavid-19, 9 590 people have been cured in the Czech Republic, 63 percent of all those infected so far.
In most cases, the disease had a slight duration.
In the hospital, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavir have a condition of 19 of them being evaluated by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, estimated at 100 thousand people still show Karvinsko, which is nearly 59.
The following is the period of Jihlava with 56 and Frydecko-Místecko with 36 people infected with 100 thousand in the last week.
As a result of the increased number of infected in Czech Republic since Saturday, new measures against the spread of coronavir are in place.
People have to wear gloves on internal collective actions of over 100 people, it's about cultural and sports events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
Since Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited from the present thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have manifestly become infected with the new coronavir has already exceeded the 16 million.
It has been introduced by the American University of Johns Hopkins, which is monitoring the development of the pandemic globally.
The balance of the victims who died of the covid-19 disease is estimated to be 645 thousand.
The most recent million people infected have reached statistics in just three days; the 15 million limit has fallen on 22 July.
In recent days, the United States, which has already registered more than 4.1 million infected, has the highest rate of rapid growth in cases in Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been ordered by the authorities.
The infected are now at a record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that from Thursday to Friday, more than 284 new cases have occurred worldwide, which is the highest daily balance from the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be added to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top in vulnerable countries such as the United States, Brazil or India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases has increased in almost 40 countries worldwide last week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The order has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case today has officially announced even the PRC.
The air in the homes is five times worse than the outdoors.
Health damage to air coolers and deodorants
Health threatens not only the poor air quality in outdoor spaces but also at home.
She pointed out that the Israeli specialist in human health, Carol Abraham, had already quoted The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who deserved the establishment of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on the damage in households right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham referred to the research of the American Environment Agency (EPA), which states that the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than that of the countryside.
The World Health Organization (WHO) judges that because of poor air quality in its homes, 3.8 million people die annually.
"Because of the epidemic of coronavir, which has forced many and still has to work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in households," Abraham said.
According to it, in Israel, the quality of "home air" is almost unforgivable.
At the same time, dangerous things can be things that people usually come into contact with — insects, air coolers, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides.
"Early gas also emits clothes that we regularly wear in the laundry," said Abraham.
The most vulnerable are children, older household members and people with respiratory problems.
Otherwise, individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, dizziness, irritation of the nose, nose bleeding, vomiting, or skin allergy.
During long-term exposure to non-healthy substances, internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all of the damage, but it comes from objects inside the house, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
