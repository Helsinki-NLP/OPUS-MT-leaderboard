Big members of the congregation are concerned about the similarities with Mapetovci
Some members of the congregation are surprised at the proposal to change their title in "the members of the Great Parliament" (MWP).
It was also due to plans to change the name of the congregation to the Belgian Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be the subject of ridicule.
One labyrinth member of the congregation said his group was concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers of Van Vels: In the village twp means silly, and pwp means rash.
A member of the political party assembly, Plaid, said that the whole group was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
A member of the large conservative party said his group was "open" about name change, but noted that there was a small difference between MWP and Mapetovac.
In this context, the statement of the great word in w is similar to the statement of the words in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, currently working on a draft law on the introduction of changes in names, said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the members of the assembly will, of course, bring the members themselves."
The law of the government of Wales of 2017 gave the congregation authority to change names.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in great support for the appointment of the assembly to the Belgian Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission has given priority to calling members of the Great Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the congregation allegedly make alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could be put at the forefront of President Elina Jones, from which it is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes to the way in which the congregation operates, including rules on the disqualification of members of the assembly and the Commission's system plan.
Members of the congregation will have the last opportunity to vote on their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians go to the referendum on changing the name of the country
The voters will vote Sunday on whether to change the name of their country in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
National voting is organised in an effort to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is the occupation of its territory and is persistently opposed to its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not admit the vote.
However, referees, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, consider the change of name to be a simple price they must pay for membership of the EU and NATO Pact.
The bells on Saint Martin were silenced while the churches in Harlem fought for survival
"The older people I spoke to say that once on every corner there were bars and churches," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one today."
He said the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People are different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer quarter-day residents where people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the managers expect, "and sooner or later, they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who will not help to preserve the rest of the quartz shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and that's why closing these churches will speed up because it's unlikely that people who move into these buildings will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist community moved in the 1930s.
The black community that served nearby took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin took over a black community under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of traders on 125th Street, the main trade street in Harlem, who opposed the formation or promotion of blacks.
The fire in 1939 greatly damaged the building, but as the parishioners of Johnson made a recovery plan, they ordered the authorities.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the organ "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the organ in July called them different: "cultural goods" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organ in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to larger organ in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said the Church of St. Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has been played in the Church of St. Martin's last few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of which were brought by church leaders and other bishops.
The Bishop's Administration – the administrative body of the bishops, composed of the head of the church – wrote to the bishop in July expressing concern that the bishop would "continue to bear the costs" to the bishop's administration, although the Bishop's Administration was not included in the rent of architects and entrepreneurs that the bishop had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's work.
The shark injured a 13-year-old during hunting in the lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he was hunting lobsters in California on the day he opened up hunting on lobsters, officials reported.
The attack took place about seven hours ago in the morning next to the beach Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said about the KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday he ran around half an hour when he heard the boy who was getting help, and then he and the group took him to him and helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was an excitement to catch the lobster, but then "he realized he was shouting, 'She bit me!'
She bit me!'
His entire key bone was broken," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water, 'The shark is in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy is transferred by helicopter to the Paediatric Hospital of the Council's where his condition is being treated as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
The rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a media address that the shark was already observed in that area several weeks earlier, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the area of the upper part of the body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the beach Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's is becoming a competition for Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams chains to department cosmetic products in the style of factory houses where professional assistants work.
As part of a significant market for beauty in Britain, worth 2.8 billion pounds, which is growing while selling on fashion markets and household equipment falls, larger cosmetics departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be extended to more shops next year if they succeed.
Investment in cosmetic products is due to the fact that supermarkets find ways to use the tools used for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetic assortment by offering more than 3,000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brand's product palette L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in departments similar to those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique makeup line by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test sales places in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened in Croydon, South London last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping on the network and moving to daily purchases of smaller quantities of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to put extra effort into attracting people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of the Sainsbury's chain, said that stores would increasingly look like factory houses in the supermarket's efforts to reverse the impact of the large Aldi and Lidl discounts, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened the Argos sales department in hundreds of its stores, and also imported and Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sales of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has ended unprovokedly.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended with a dispute about sharing the income of the pharmacy in their stores.
The new strategy came into effect three years ago after Sainsbury's sold his 281 pharmacy to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury products for skin care in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our assortment brand is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations means that we are now an irrevocable destination of the market of beauty that sets new standards in relation to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "excited" after Holly Willoughby retired from a $11 million deal
The Dragons Day star, Peter Jones, is "angrished" after the television director Holly Willoughby withdrew from the deal with his personal brand worth 11 million pounds to focus on his contracts with the companies Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand home and additional equipment Truly.
This money company is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
This Morning (37) issue director announced his departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was angry with the Dragons' Dan Peter Jones show star by withdrawing from their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on their new entry contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said Jones was "angrily" when a golden girl admitted to television, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that there was no longer time to devote to their branding of household and additional equipment Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his weekends.
The source said, "Holly Truly put himself in the top of his priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan to ensure her earnings over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has affected everything.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday was so close to launch.
In Marlow's headquarters, there's a lot of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that this Morning, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could cost millions because of huge investment in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and the possible additional delay of the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Capp, ten years old.
Willoughby founded Truely with Cappov in 2016, and Jones (52) joined as company director in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Anta McPartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebrity's I'm.
The source near Jones said last night, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He complained about the criticism he could get from the media because of comments that could be characterized as "unprecedented" and because of a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said to his crazy voice, "reader of the news."
"I didn't give up at all."
It turned out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward to the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see the "adequate response" by the US at the first steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his talk at the meeting.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We've been on a step from the North Korean War.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to repair relationships with Kimo led to positive results - the cessation of missile testing, the release of hostages and the return of the afterlife remains of American soldiers.
And he stood in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act Presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this full arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the world in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After the earthquake on Lombok Island, for example, foreign NGOs have been told that their assistance is not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been settled, the state of the national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be rather difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children's organization is a team that will travel to Pala, it's still not sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disasters Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation on the island of Pala to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in the provision of assistance.
In view of the constant earthquake in Indonesia, it is regrettable how much this country is not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although the tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently, there was no siren for the tsunamis on the island of Pala, although the warning was in force, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help victims of earthquakes is on their way to Paul, but it will take him at least three days to get to the scene of a new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's long-term infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has hit Mr. Yoko's administration while the next year is expecting new elections.
Mr. Yoko was also under pressure from long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have lost lives and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the street struggles of Christian and Muslim groups, who used swords, bows and arrows, and the remaining primitive weapons.
See: Footballer Liverpool Daniel Sturridge inserted a deep-separative match against Chelsea football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League at the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shakiri at some 30 yards from Chelsea's naked club while his team lost 1:0.
He moved the ball to his left side and then he slammed into the outside stable.
The ball flew high above the penal area turning to the top right corner of the network.
In the end it fell over Kep Arrizabalg, who was in the jump and fell into the net.
"It was just to position, to receive the ball, and players like Shaq always go forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time," Sturruuge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea ran 1-0 at half-time after the Belgian star Eden Hazard hit in the 25th minute.
In that fifth attack, the Blue Attacker added Mateu Kovacic's ball before running from the middle of the field to Liverpool in half.
The coin quickly touched and brought the ball back to the center of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, pointing Hazard into a prison space.
Hazard was faster than a defense and ended up near the stables by putting his left leg on the net outside of Liverpool Alison Becker.

The number of Indonesian tsunami victims reached 832
The number of victims of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
A large number of people were reported in the ruins of a building that destroyed a 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and raised the waves high and up to 20 feet, the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the remains of broken buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was killed
A murder investigation was conducted after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, in the Merseyside area.
Forty-four-year-old was found beaten at 7:55 in the morning at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police called people who saw or heard anything to answer.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is early, but I'm calling all who were near John Street Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded some cameras on the car control panels, to contact us because they may have information that is important for the investigation."
The police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead and that she was found in the house.
This afternoon's friends who think they know a woman came to the face of a place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is continuing, and the police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was missing the text when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that they will have to wait hours before they are allowed to come back in.
They heard a cop tell a man that the whole area is considered a crime scene.
One woman came to a crime scene in tears.
She said, "This is so terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van next door.
A larger number of police officers were inside the police cordon, overseeing the residential building.
All who have any information are invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111, stating the case 247 of 30 September.
Statua Cromwell in parliament became the newest monument in the middle of a "revision of history" dispute.
Its removal would be poetic justice due to the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England that his Puritan followers carried out in the Taliban way.
But Cromwell Society's proposal was described by Mr. Crick as "crazy" and "an attempt to review history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "As part of the current debate on the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace in Westminster became a target.
Cromwell didn't even order it, he didn't do it during the English civil war.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestors Thomas of the past century.
The magnificent display of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of an opinion from the 19th century and a part of the character's history that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell many consider, perhaps by the end of the nineteenth century rather than today, to be the protector of parliament from outside pressure, in his case monarchy.
Whether this is entirely the subject of a permanent historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict from the middle of the seventeenth century formed further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable character representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord of Protectors are also worthy of glory and remembrance."
The killer's pig caused death to the Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man, known only as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood in a pig in a market in the town of Liupanshui in Guizhou area, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was prepared to inject the pigs into the pigs of the vaccine in May 30th 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig's mouth with blood around his mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a heavy-duty 550-liber pig caused fatal injuries to the farmer, as stated in the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodthirsty and broken," said the cousin who introduced himself as Wu, conveying Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera records Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the attack on other people while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners are allegedly negotiating a rebate for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have been reported earlier.
The pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, killing a man's critical injury.
Ten years earlier, a pig had a heavy 650 libre, and she loved a big farmer with his tractor until his wife was scared and exhausted.
After the pigs ate the Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer said to CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "dejector".
"They're just playing.
They like to pee, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The rest of Rosa's hurricane brings widespread rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened by moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods of rains across northern Mexico and southwestern the United States in the next few days.
Rosini's first category hurricane winds reached 85 miles an hour from five o'clock in the morning in the east time on Sunday, and it was 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, I form in the Pacific and move to the east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical storm of Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday, it will begin to push the tropical investment north of the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture together with the emerging mine will create widespread rains in the southwest in the following days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, floods and possible glaciers in the desert.
The high tropical moisture will result in falls that will instantly reach and 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of a sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical precipitation of tropical rain.
Flying pedestrians in the desert would be extremely thoughtless at the risk of tropical rains.
Heavy rains in the canyons could result in wild rivers and thunderstorms, sometimes with strong winds and sand storms.
As I arrive, I will bring the local rains on the parts of the coast of southern California.
It is possible to cause total precipitation over half of the inches, which could cause the nanos and the climbs of August.
This will be the first wet season rain in the region.
The room will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday before the rain gets spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The spits will reach Four Corners on Tuesday, and all Wednesdays will continue.
In October, large fluctuations of temperatures across the United States can occur as the Arctic is getting colder, and the tropicals continue to remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short growths.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the Central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omahi, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the summer heat remains will try again to pick up and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures from about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a great possibility of temperature above average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the high court and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political resistance continues, with issuers that interrupt regular broadcasting due to the latest complexity on Friday: an agreement that Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI on a one-week prosecution investigation.
Ford told the Senate judicial commission that it was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had touched and tried to untie at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said that it was 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company has been accounting for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not available immediately for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble getting the people who follow the transfer from the office.
In order to get a better touch, it's a audience similar to the one that follows football elimination swords or Oscar's assignment.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led ahead of other networks with an average number of 5.69 million viewers during the day-to-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, said from Nielsen.
The interest is high and after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After the office of a moderate Republican issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS network cameras recorded the recordings of protestors who yelled at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He was standing on the sidewalk for a few minutes while they were insulting him, with a live transfer to the CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him, "You have power when so many women are unable."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there was more to say at the hearing of the commission.
Cable and television networks had a live transmission hours later while the judicial commission voted whether to continue the appointment of the Kavanaugh Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would do it only on condition that the FBI investigate charges against the so-called next week, which calls for a minority of Democrats.
Flakea, part of the conversation with a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few more senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's election was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation of charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in the Sunday Times interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In a second interview to her headline, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying it was a proposal that the UK and the EU take customs from each other "very absurd".
The murder of Waydea Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of the LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Waydea Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Ditheon Simpson (20) was arrested and imprisoned under a second-degree murder charge, said Baton Rouge police department.
Officials published video records of the fight between Sims and Simpson and police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reporting the WAFB channel of the CBS network.
After the Simpson investigation, police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail was $350,000, a lawyer said.
Baton Rouge's death squad issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot in the head and neck.
The department said the merits belong to the police working group for the Louisiana fugitives, the criminal police lab, the South University police and the local authorities who helped during the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva Club thanked the local law enforcement agency for "the desirability and the desire to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker six feet high and six inches grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the club LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at the LSU Will Wade Club said the team was "sudden" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"This is what we keep worrying about," Wade said.
Vulcan throws ash through Mexico City
The ashes that blossomed the Volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased and after 183 emissions of gas and ashes were registered in 24 hours.
The center was tracking more earthquakes and poisoning.
Photos on social media show a thin layer of ash covering windshield cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increased volcanic activity of 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the earthquake of 7.1 hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police confronted Catalan separatists with an annual independence referendum
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after the protesters, supporters of independence, clashed with a special police squad, when thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations about marking the anniversary of a polarizing Catalan withdrawal referendum.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special police squad, threw them with their eggs and colors in the dust, making dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the course of the day, they broke out and raided the police who used pendulums to slow down the fight.
Independents have been scandalizing for hours "There is no forgetting, no forgiveness" and struggling with the Union's supporters who have called "The Living of Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries they suffered in protests, local press reported.
The tensions are still high in the region, which was defined as independence a year after the first October referendum that Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
Voters have chosen the vast majority of independence, even though the output was low because the anti-fungals boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in violent conflicts across the region.
Groups defending independence camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they're allowed to vote, but we're in a locker now," he said.
Although they took a key but decisive victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan parties who advocated independence had difficulty holding back because some of their most well-known leaders were in a self-appointed exile or in custody, awaiting trial for their role in organizing a referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a protest on the phone to support the police, said politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
"It gets all tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who was in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in elections for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidacy in European elections is the best way to condemn the backward democratic values and repression imposed by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after being hit by a car in the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested several times by car in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point a car was fired from a single shot.
Menge's shot brought Livingstone a 1-0 victory against Rangers.
First goal Dolly Menge secured a victory for Livingstone
The advanced Livingstone surprised Rangers and noted only another loss for Steven Gerrard at the 18th Ibrox club.
The goal of Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was aligned with Hibernate in another place.
Gerard's club hasn't noticed any victory in the guests in the Premier League this season and will play against the first-placed Hearts behind which eight points remain next week.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapids from Vienna to the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has extended a series of matches in the league to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't yet experienced a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity against a missing guest
Holt's team was supposed to be in charge a lot before they scored the goal because their direct game was very problematic for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt went past the goal, then Alan Lithgrow's attempt went past the goal after he cleaned up to receive the ball that Craig Halkett had with his head turned to the goal.
Hosts were asked to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free hits.
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
He was sentenced to a free strike against Rangers, Livingstone made a passage, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Mang, who took the ball and hit it from the center of the prison.
Until now, Rangers dominated the ball, but the sheltered host remained unprovoked and the naked Liam Kelly didn't have much trouble.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the foot of the Golman Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot too wide from another free hit for Livingston.
Crosses have constantly arrived in the prison area of Livingstone and have been constantly defended, while two penalties that were sought – one after the case against the replacement player Glenn Middleton, and the other because of the game – have not been awarded.
"Fenemenal Game" Livingstone – Analysis
Newspaper BBC Scotland, Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
All up to one was great and they continue to surpass expectations on the way up.
Their style of games and players almost haven't changed since their return to the top, but the big credit belongs to Holt who gives it energy to the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a well-organized defense, until Menga gave peace to Connor Goldson and Joe Worralla through the entire match.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were under Gerarrd's bat from time to time, they didn't reach that level.
The final hits were missing – only once through the host lines – and this is a kind of wake-up call for Rangers located in the middle of the table.
A mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and blue sky while Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan Germany, whose objective is to repair the NATO relationship with the Allies.
They are divided on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where the largest number of Turks out of Turkey lives.
Police have imposed security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who oppose Erdogan – many of them Kurdi – were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Double protests reflect the split in opinions about a guest of some German Turks celebrating as a hero, while others blame him for being an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: The biker died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
There was a crash near the intersection of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, on the road to Deptford, on the southeast of the city, about 10:15 after British weather.
The car driver stopped and intervened with an ambulance, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after the other biker died in the part where the driver left the crash place on the Childers Street street, which is about a mile away from the crash site.
The London police said they were working on the victim's identification and family information.
The streets are closed, the buses are redirected, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six staff injured in accidents
Six prison officials were injured in high-security riots for men, said from the Prison Office.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin's prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 a.m. and they're still going on.
A special team of officials called "Tornado" to calm down the nerves in which eight guards are involved in one wing of the prison.
Officials have suffered minor facial injury and help is provided on the spot
The Portparol prison administration said: "We have arranged specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident that is ongoing in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received medical assistance due to the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that the police will be responsible for this and that they could be extended prison sentences."
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison manager was admitted to hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special team was called to prison for serious accidents in which staff were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which can be useful in areas affected by drought)
Rarely when tropical depression hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen in the beginning of next week while Hurricane Rosa goes through the desert-west region with its remaining energy, bearing the risk of flooding.
National Meteorological Administration has already issued warnings for floods Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and south and east Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will announce the rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix stated that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 had maintained the status of tropical storms or depression around 200 miles around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rockies chain and Great Basin, there will probably be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there is no fear of floods, the Rosina rain could be a blessing because the area is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls are likely to be of benefit because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the U.S. drought control agency, less than 40% of Arizona was hit by extreme drought, another highest category," weather.com said.
First, on his way, Hurricane Rosa will lead to a ski resort on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the force of hurricane on Sunday mornings with winds of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific, and that's why it's going to start swallowing.
Therefore, Mexico is expected to hit the tropical storm by force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Pulsions in parts of Mexico could be very strong and can pose a major risk of flooding.
"A total of three to six inches falls are expected from Bai California to northwestern Sonor, and perhaps even 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico by tropical storm before coming to Arizona early in the morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and south Utah late in the evening.
"The main danger expected of Rose or its remains is major rains in Baja California, the North West Sonori and the South-West Desert," said the National Hurricane Centre.
These rains are expected to result in life-threatening storms and floods in the deserts, as well as glaciers in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a sixteen-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
Teenagers found injured near the Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 hours in the morning after British weather.
He's taken to the hospital and he's in a stable condition.
Seventeen-year-olds, two-eight-year-olds and twenty-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset policemen.
Officials are calling to call those who have any footage of the events on the mobile phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the subjugation and anger" of the democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugha is a vote against the brutal and unwarranted tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered contempt and anger" of the democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the claims of Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually assaulted several decades ago while he was a teenager.
Ford also witnessed his charges at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw the shine, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for the confirmation of the Kavanucha judge is the vote for the confirmation of one of the most powerful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," a group of dockers in West Virginia said.
The president touched on the nominations of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' exit in the middle of the elections.
"Five weeks from the most important choice of our lives.
Although I'm not running myself, I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claims that democracy tries to "provide resistance and hinder."
The first key procedural vote in the CNN Senate is expected not later than Friday, a senior official of the Republican Party said.
Hundreds lost their lives in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase
At least 384 people died, many of them collected by huge waves that hit the beaches, when the great earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered because of a beach festival in the city of Pala on Friday, when waves were up to six feet (18 feet) down the coast in the summer, bringing many to death and destroying everything they found their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the danger of tsunami was announced yesterday, people were still dealing with their business on the beach and did not run away immediately, and were killed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster relief agency, said in a talk in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, carried cars, balloons, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled over the open sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people got on trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Pala.
Photos from the air, issued by the disaster agency, show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, damaged and destroyed bridges and mosque surrounded by water.
Supporting continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of a massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city, located on the edge of the long, narrow bay, increased the power of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as a "range" and said it was destroyed by thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of fallen buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be larger along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area of Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of earthquakes.
Communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," they said in the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised because it did not report that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records distributed on social networks show men on top of the street who panickly warn people on the incoming tsunamis.
Within minutes the water wall hit the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused the disappearance of electricity that has cut off communications around Palu, making saving efforts by the government difficult.
The army began sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuations still need food and other basic supplies.
The City Airport is reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palou on Sunday.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision's staff must have arrived from Dongale in Pal, where the employees were located in the tents erected in the yard of the office, they witnessed the scenes of destruction on the way, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams began taking the first steps to alleviate the disaster, there was a complaint that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of foreign resources, supplies and people is only possible if the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster of the territorial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'okay, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international aid, but that status has not yet been declared."
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami falls on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their tragedy story in this natural disaster will be relieved.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been tortured for two days by her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, an Indonesian paragliding team coach, trained two missing paragliders in the eyes of the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagija, were his students.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I bear my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon remembers that hours after the news of Roa Roa's collapse spread through the circles of the paraglider whatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages had only one gray hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while filling the ATMs in the Newport on the Levee complex.
On Friday morning, according to a police report in Newport, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brinka employee who filled a ATM in Newport on the Levee.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the fun complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, the other man ran behind the Brin's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
The witnesses saw more suspects running from the scene, standing in a statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
All who have any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: reper rename in Y
Reper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Posting a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It will be previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time under the title Ye and used the title for his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurred before his performance at the Saturday Night Live show, where the promotion of his new Yandhi album is expected.
He replaced the singer Arian Grande who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons," the author of the show said.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West earlier said that this word had religious significance for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us.
It came from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names of Love and Brother Love.
Former West's co-worker, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without letters and large letters.
AMLO in Mexico swore not to use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he would never use military force against civilians while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to submit to the Mexican people."
The army shot at peaceful demonstrations on the market in October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people at the time when the left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide support to young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity to educate young people in criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in that field, an investor and an artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments came after various parts of the US authorities issued an article on artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China published its plan last year: their goal is to be first in the field of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chances of next great achievements in the field of artificial intelligence happen in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Sustained Artistic Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and a new world order", published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most outstanding art intelligence companies in China, Face++.
He worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon in the 1980s on an artificial intelligence system that proved to be superior to the top-ranking American Othello player, and later he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google China border.
Lee confessed to earlier American government technological contests, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when to plan the next contests on which future visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to make enormous efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"We are not being taken away by China's academic leaders, that's what corporations do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed great individuals from the university in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think you should automatically offer green maps to doctors from the field of artistic intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan for the development of the art intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants grants to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Defence Department formed the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to include partners from the industry and the academic community, and the White House announced the formation of the Electoral Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the National Scientific Foundations, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in the research of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the US legislation which sought to form the Commission's national security for artificial intelligence does not do anything for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday at the referendum to change the country's name in "North Macedonian Republic", a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of their northern neighbour represents the occupation of its territory and has put veto on their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments have reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents claim this could endanger the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Djorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised questions as to whether the referendum would come out at least 50 per cent of what it took to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot sheet was, "Are you a member of NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Candidates of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries created by the collapse of Yugoslavia, deserves to pay for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, to live freely within the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that they would be guided by the result of the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change names.
The State Election Commission stated that there was no report of irregularities until 1 hour in the afternoon.
However, output was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of voters went to the elections.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said José Tanevski (62), a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted in the Macedonian referendum on the change of names, which could open their way to NATO membership and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and brought chairs in front of the tents that were broken down by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not on the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud land.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said membership in the NATO alliance would bring over the necessary investment in Macedonia whose unemployment rate is greater than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will vote 'for' because more than 80 per cent of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after inserting the papers.
He said the result of "for" would be "the confirmation of our future."
The poll published in the Macedonian Institute for Political Research on Monday said that 30 to 43% of the voter will participate in the referendum – which is below the level of output required.
According to the second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote for.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it takes a 50 per cent exit plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government since it came to power last May.
See: Player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the entire defense of Brighton and achieves goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have rid themselves of Brighton's defenses in the 2nd Manchester City win against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero reached the goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between the three Briggton defense players before he found himself in the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green suits.
He pushed around a defensive player and was faster than a few more on the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker took advantage of his first shot in a prison space to return the ball to Agueru, who, on the right-hand side of the attacker, took control of the Brighton Matthew Ryan by hitting the right-hand side of the network.
"Aguero had some foot problems," Coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We're lucky he got naked at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave the aliens the initial advantage in the Prime Minister League.
He got naked in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero received a ball deep in Brighton's part of the field.
He added the beautiful Leroy Saneu on the left.
Sane touched it a few times before sending Sterling to go naked.
The invincible attacker threw the ball into the net before he slipped out of the field.
The city is fighting Hoffenheim in the group phase of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Thursday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game with no competitive significance against Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But competing Scherzer hopes to take a stand Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, are still in high school.
Rockies at least have a direct passage due to a 5:2 victory against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first title in the league.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can go out in the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other team will probably be at the highest level compared to all other years.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
Nationals still need to publish the initial team on Sunday, but they're supposed to let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would have been the 34th time to start the game, coached on Thursday and threw on Sunday when he usually rested.
The Washington right-hand man runs 18:7 this season for an average of $2.53,300 in 220 2/3 inning.
Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation regarding the election of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugha, as he spoke about the importance of the Republican's election in half-term.
"Everything we've done will be on the dice in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choice of our lives.
These are one of the big, big – even though I didn't run, I'm actually a candidate because I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "You see these horrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to restore power using all possible ways, see the evil, dirty games.
No harm will come to those who are in danger of it, so that they may gain power and control, but they will have power and control as they wish, and We shall not give them that which they desire.
The Democrats, he said, are in the mission of "response and interference".
"And you've seen it in the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angrily, evil, and dishonest."
He quoted a democratic senator and a member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Diane Feinstein, as urging the public to speak out loud.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting -- that was the worst language of the body -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different positions.
She's intolerant to those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party border voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
Besides, I am the last in a number of Labour Members of parliament who were told not to welcome, and all because we expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
News from a meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party's border says "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local laborer member of parliament, the meetings on Friday night were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not the same and the promise of "more kind, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It became increasingly evident that the different opinion was not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was assessed on the basis of whether it was acceptable to the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I believed to share similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take positions I would never agree with, whether it was about national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – it’s accompanied by a bluff of social network insults, a call for removal from the party, judging the politics of the center and telling me that I shouldn’t be in the labyrinth.
And that's not just me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments are mostly of political nature to me.
I'm amazed by the professionalism and determination of a colleague who's been carrying on a daily schedule with a bunch of sexist or racist insults, but they don't pull.
Something that disappointed me most in this political era is how these levels of insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should care for the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different positions and any vote of non-confidentialness or changes in the rules of the party selection is narrowed down.
I've got a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been telling me to raise my head, be less loud, and then I'm gonna be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago because of the absence of Prime Minister Thatcher's government, which literally reduced my elementary school students, I have been trying to assume better public services to those most in need, either as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I never hid my policy, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused with my political positions and areas of conflict with the current management.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would order that, when the country falls to Brexit, which is going to threaten the household, business and our public services, I don't understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not directed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to voters in my election unit, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that the threat of removing me from the party or the political stimuli will not prevent me from acting in the way I think it is in the best interest of all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: The Unforgettable Father at the Top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has won a win in this exciting game day at the Tennent's Prime Minister of the League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unbeatable of ten teams.
In the end, the home team took the victory thanks to the superior defense, as well as the larger number of opportunities used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason for satisfaction.
"So far we've been tested in games and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayru every honour, they took advantage of their opportunities better than us."
The temptation of Grant Naderson in the 14 minutes that turned Frazier Climo, gave the advantage to Ayr, but it was yellow cardboard for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, whom the Warriors let him play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerous advantage and Jason Baggot caught the unconquered attempt.
Climo pendulum increased Ayra's leadership before, just before half-time, he made a solo attempt to hit the score from 17:5 to Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose's second half started well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which turned Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to the serious injury caused by Ruarid Knott, who was brought out on the carrier, and Ayr continued to increase the advantage of Stafford McDowall's attempt to convert Climo.
Captain Ayra's deputy, Blair Macpherson, then got yellow cartons, and Melrose again used numerous powers with Bruce Colvin's unresolved attempt, after a period of severe pressure.
However, the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card due to the crash over the climate without a ball. MacPherson reached the touch down with the penalty line behind the incoming Ayra mill.
Climo turned, as he did almost from the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch into prison and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth host's attempt.
The Still Game series star prepares for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still game series, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move to the hospitality industry after learning that it is appointed as the director of the company of licensed restaurants.
A 50-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series that he writes and plays together with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the series and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun's journal stated that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "responsible restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, who has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Marines patrol the sea in La Paz.
In public buildings there are the winds of oceanic flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are intertwined with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to the sea is our duty."
Throughout the land Bolivia is still a strong memory of the coast they have lost in favour of Chile in the bloody flood around natural resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to refuel the Pacific.
These hopes may be the biggest in the last few decades, while Bolivia expects the judgement of the International Court of Justice of the first October after five years of the council.
"Bolivia has caught the advantage, in the spirit of unity and prosperity, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will view the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge for Bolivia and argue that – after a decade of grueling negotiations – Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of native origin, who faces a controversial fight for a re-election next year, also plays a major role in the issue of the verdict that will be brought on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it's unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia, and that it will change a little even if it decides.
The body of the United Nations with its seat in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict was made only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of progressing in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of exit to the sea has been captured by current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' wartime rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean good will, it's out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one time, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put a point on 139 years of non-conformity to mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the issue of exits to the sea as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to go out to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not stop nuclear weapons until they believed in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made at the Singapore summit among the conflicting leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed on the border to re-start nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's just letting the dreams go that the continuation of the sanctions and opposition to the U.S. declaration ending the Korean war will never throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pjonggang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, the government is universally skeptical when it comes to the seriousness of Pjongang in terms of the rejection of the nuclear arsenal that that country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongang next month to prepare a second summit of Kim and Trump.
The latest series of huge hats presented in Paris fashion magazines that you will soon see in the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely protect the sun, you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of massive hats on the tracks of their Spring and Summer 2019 magazines, all based on the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have won Instagram this summer, and these designers have shown their impressive creations on fashion trails.
Valentine's most outstanding piece was the over-exposed hat with a wide perennial round that swallowed the head of the model.
Among the other glamorous additions, there were skulls with beautiful stones, magic hats, even pineapple, but their purpose is not to keep your head from cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks and that in time for Halloween.
Many of the hairy masks had swollen lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than in high fashion.
One creation looked like a diving equipment with a trigger and a mask, and the other reminded of a cornet with a melted ice cream.
And if you're among those who follow the trend of attracting attention, you're lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
Huge hats came after "La Bombe", a broken hat with a two-step radius seen on many stars, from Rihanne to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult brand that invented this very impractical hat that flooded social networks, sent another great creation on the track – a broken beach bag that is almost as big as the model it wore.
The Zagasitonarandjasta bag of rafia with rations and white leather lunch was highlighted in detail by Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 in Paris's fashion week.
The founder of the famous Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops in time for the next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for the pre-named fashion supplements."
John Edward: Knowing the language is of key importance to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be commended for their outstanding academic achievements, which continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding results in the studies, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, which represents the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strives to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, chosen careers and a place in the society of the world's citizens.
As an educational sector that can invent and implement its own teaching plan and programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable the preferred subject of chess in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands it makes his head sick.
If you speak to him in his language, it will make his heart rejoice."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's exam, we see that the languages at the top of the league table, with the highest pass ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students learning foreign languages received an A assessment at the final school exam.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students received an assessment A from the Mandarin language in the secondary school, while 72% of those learning German, 69% of those learning French and 63% of those learning Spanish also received an assessment A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Languages are now treated in the same way as STEM objects (natural sciences, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in independent schools programs, and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling jobs were just the same as those who know foreign languages.
So knowing foreign languages is becoming increasingly necessary for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs for which foreign language knowledge is needed, this skill is necessary in the world of globalisation.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he knows another language, he'll have a real advantage in the future because it's a skill for life.
The skills of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to a YouTube survey conducted among over 4,000 British in 2013, 75 percent did not know to speak another language well enough to conduct the conversation, while the French was the only language spoken by the two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why investing in foreign language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
Every school in Scotland is different when it comes to language learning.
Many schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are more important to Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be several languages from which you can choose in independent schools, with expert teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing the learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future awaits them.
At this time it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages are of key importance to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done well.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will debit for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is soon over for fans who want to see the first LeBron James performance for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play in the preseason match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still don't know how many minutes to play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, claimed that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about plans in six games during President Lakers.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need preseasonal swords to prepare," he said.
Trump's collection in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of pre-election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings in the next week, including visits to friendly arranged places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his voice is waiting for a full-fledged seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate because Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
When is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven hours tonight after Eastern Time, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's collection in West Virginia under the transmission live on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearing this week about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court in which it was tense for a sexual harassment charge, and the expected vote in the Senate was postponed within seven days until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the overarching objective of this series of collections is to help the Republicans achieve a better outcome in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that the meetings are held this week to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to information from Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the pre-election campaign season," Trump's Reuters portal campaign, which refused to present itself, said.
Scheduled at Westbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight's assembly could gather supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract the media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday there will be another time this month Trump will visit West Virginia, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who's not standing well in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to raise his rating in polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at West Virginia University, according to a Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team showed the struggle to hold hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Zamaha is a completely invented concept in sport, but one of those in which players truly believe, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got a swing right now?
"They've led six points, and now four, so you can say it's a turn on our side," said Jordan Speeth on his way out.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points more, with 12 more in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there's much to give them encouragement, between the other forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one took three points of the four possible.
Speeth was brilliant from the first to the last blow and led by his example.
Celebrations were becoming louder during his round to finally play a key hit for the unsolved result in the fourth match when he and Thomas were behind two after two.
His final blow with a 15-hole match was awaited by a similar shout, one that reflects the belief that there is hope for the American team.
"You just have to give everything to yourself and take care of your sword," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spythe and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly Ryder's main story.
Unusual, but inflexible European couple got all four matches and games without mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't play God's hits on Saturday afternoon, and they escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game that has been shown so far also the way in which they share energy with the loud audience has been strengthened in the position of main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinaria who could take a potential European victory while the sun rises over the Le Golf National Club.
It would be best for both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about the European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly overpowered by Serge Garcius, a hero playing with four balls that morning when he was playing with Alex Noren.
One divine blow and two doubles in the first nine holes buried Spain and Sweden in a hole from which to the end they could not even dig.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The games with four balls and squares are so fascinating to look close because of the interaction between couples, advice that they give and do not give, and the way in which the strategy can be changed at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage before the final day, but this session has shown four and that the U.S. team has a desire to fight in which some suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day Ryder bath
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant prelude, as after Saturday's matches with four ball and four players won the 10-6th priority over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, first led with two victories over unsolicited Tiger Woods, increasing the current score in the Le Golf National Club on four points.
Europeans Thomas Bjorn fought to win back a trophy lost in Hazeltin's golf club two years ago, dominated inaccurate Americans in the morning game with four balls and won a 3-1 series.
The United States has provided greater resistance to the fourth tournament, winning two matches, but they could not reduce the balance.
Team Jim Furyk has to win eight points in 12 single swords on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debit who won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called Molliwood after a fantastic weekend, only the second couple in Ryder Cup history, who won four points in the first four matches.
After running Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they made great compositions and mastered the tired Woods and American deputator Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who pulled through two matches on Saturday, was flashing for moments, but now he lost 19 of the 29 matches in the game with four balls and fours and seven in the row.
Juston Rose, who was resting during the morning game with four balls, returned to Henry Stenson's fourth tournament and suffered defeat 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk – the first and third in the world.
Europe has yet not all come up with the plan of this pleasant mid-day south-west of Paris.
The triple winner of the main tournament Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a target for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They chose the victory of 2:1 against Jon Rahmo and Ian Poulter in the game with four balls, to return and win Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in the fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder bathed some team returned after the remaining four points in front of individual swords, although Fury's side defending the title is a sufficient unsolved result to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in another place, it seems that they could not carry out a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea advises that "no talk" about unilateral disarmament if not trusted
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions exacerbated her mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would never unilaterally renounce its nuclear weaponry.
At the annual UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Hu said that North Korea has taken "significant measures in order to show good will", such as the interruption of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear polygons and the promise that it will not increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no appropriate US response," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no talk about our first unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known claims of North Korea against Washington's "step-by" approach to denouncing that North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denouncing from the game as Pjongang earlier did.
Ri was invited to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current president of the United States and North Korea's leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump was committed to providing North Korea with a security guarantee.
North Korea is seeking the formal end of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pjongang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also responded to calls to mitigate international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States does not give up "denuclearization first of all" and increases the level of pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal in force, even opposed to "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can throw us on our knees is letting the dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, about which American leader spoke in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister made three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If we were to negotiate this problem on denuclearization with South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come into such an unexplained position."
Yet, the tone of Rio's speech was radically different from last year when the UN General Assembly said that shooting US ground missiles in North Korea was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much more should be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea implements denuclearization.
On Wednesday Trump said he had not set up a time frame for this, saying, "If it is necessary, let it take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the steps they have taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be carried out strictly and without delay until complete, final, confirmed denuclearizations come to an end."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea that have been applied since 2006, in an attempt to disable funding for the Pjongg nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rio van General Assembly of the UN and then said he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
He's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip hasn't gone well.
In July he left Pyongyang with the words that progress has been made, and North Korea condemned him only a few hours later for "gangster demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would dismantle a missile polygon as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that there were "appropriate measures" requiring security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize his relationship with Washington.
The Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to make students get more sleep in an effort to eradicate the more popular school culture "all night with the help of caffeine".
One academic noted that students of the leading university in the world are often ignorant of their basic concerns.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has established a course he considers to be the only one in the United States.
The inspiration to launch this course was given after a speech that held about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"A girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this just now, in my high school year?'
She said that nobody ever told her how important a dream was – which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, provides the basis for how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports outcomes, as well as improving their overall situation.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Service, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was observed that students suffered during the week from a serious lack of sleep.
The uniform course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of a room in the student's home and students should click on the coffee chairs, curtains, patches and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as about the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performances and the meaning of pre-sleep routines.
The second part tells participants that a long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects there is in the decision to smoke cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride because of the "resurrection of the night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to a growing lack of sleep problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that of quality, should be "secret weapon" students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against a higher kilograms, because as a result of a lack of sleep, the brain passes into a hunger regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler come up with a course after he attended one of his lectures in Harvard last year.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to rely on his maintenance at the level of the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all post-graduates to carry out a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended to the students to consider setting up an alarm in time for sleep and awakening and to account for the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the circus rhythm, thereby leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal has defeated Gerarrd's team
The Rangers experienced another depressed defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga sent the rescue team Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat from Livingstone.
The team from Ibrox wanted to take the first victory in the guests after the 4th February triumph in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt made Gerrard a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unsuccessful leaders of the Ladbrokes Prime Minister League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half an hour ago, and the uninspired ranks of Rangers never came close to equality.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingstone has risen to third and behind are Hibernate only because of the nude difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after the line judge Calum Spence had to show help when he was being shot on the side of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that crossed Ayr and placed himself in the semifinals of Betfred bath.
On the other hand, Holt identified himself as the same eleven Livingstone players who last week took the point of Hearts and would be thrilled by the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every step.
Maybe the Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingstone made better use of his time with the ball.
It was a little short of reaching goal just two minutes after Menga sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the middle-field player missed a big chance and shot at the goal.
Deeply free hit Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgov just managed to shut up next to the goal, the end of the station.
Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he was supposed to get a penalty in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless met, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers achieved only two goal strikes in the first half, but the former goalman Ibrox, Liam Kelly, without any major problems, defended the hit by Lassane Coulibaly's head and shook the silence that directed Ovie Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livingstone in the 34th minute may not reflect the real force relationship in the course of the game, no one can deny that he was deserved, if nothing else, then because of the effort made.
The Rangers couldn't re-election with a deep free hit of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, which remained calm and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerard reacted to the interruption of the introduction of Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and this replacement almost immediately resulted when the wing player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran off his line and blocked him.
However, Livingstone continued to instruct guests to play exactly the way it fits them, with the long matches of Lithgov and Halket.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor was well held up and defended the attack of Jacobs, so that Lithgov from the corner would send a ball next to the goal.
The replacement player Rangers, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, was looking for another penalty when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: Geiger's Designer
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning Almash: September 30, 1882, to this day 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that in time will become a device known as Geiger's numerator.
In addition to being one of the major scientific protests, Geiger's counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950's "Call Koronada" film, in which they played apparently incredible cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, used to locate radioactive minerals as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms thanks to the radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans, "Yeah, that's a kiss."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" the criminal cell.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches an immunological system to identify malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure includes removing immunological cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory
They can thus "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancers, and then they are reinjected
The experimental vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of the ovaries of the woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the removal of immunological cells from the patient, their transformation into the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2 and their reinjection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps growth of several types of cancers" including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immunological cells from patients and "learning" the same way that targeting small cells was effective in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave a loud speech in support of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance in the SNL show.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was released in a study during a Saturday night live show following a babate performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song, called Ghost Town, and that night he was wearing a hat with the title "Make America a Great", insulting the Democrats and again talking about his support for Trump.
"I've talked so many times to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?
So if I didn't care about racism, I'd have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started a sketch show involving Matt Damon and in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial commission on allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it's not broadcast, the video of West's speech was shared on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make West laugh by setting up a video.
The West also complained to the public that it was hard behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They chased me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They've been harassing me!
And then they say to me that I'm down," he said according to Washington Examiner's instructions.
West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "will turn Superman's coat because it means you can't order me.
Try love."
His comments caused a public fluctuation at least twice, and the members of the SNL's show team were visible, he passed on Variety, while one person who was present said, "The entire studio was completely silent."
Westa brought in as a replacement for Arian Grande, whose former partner, Reper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
The West confused many with the song's performance and loves it crushed into Perrier's mouth.
Westa supported the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not getting back before the abuse."
But the director of the show Karen Hunt tweeted that the West was simply "what he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (such as buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he embraces and spreads ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, saying that he now "will be previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A colleague of the reper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course a dead music legend Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then "an artist previously known as Prince".

The star of the series "Church Games", Kit Harington condemned toxic cat culture
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who beats a mule in a violent medieval fantasy, HBO series of the throne game.
However, the actor (31) broke down on the stereotype of the hero's sword, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys often think they should be rude to be respected.
In a statement on Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of a toxic cat culture at the time #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married a partner from Leslie Rose's Presbyterian Games (31), admitted that he had a "strong need" to deal with this problem.
"My personal question at the moment is quite a matter of concern to me - in which we have made a mistake in presenting manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of the toxic cat of culture due to the display of characters that are represented as men.
He said, “What is born, and what is the matter with you?”
What is it about what they teach us on TV and on the streets, why do young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of men's behavior?
I think it is actually one of the main issues of our time — how can we change it?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for young people.'
He also admitted in the interview that he would not agree to the pre-school lectures or classes of the game after the end of the next summer, saying he "ended with battlefields and horses".
Since November Kit will be acting in the playpiece Sam Shepard True West, talking about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently discovered that he thought that he had met his wife, Rose, the best thing that happened in the game of the throne.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she gave me the future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love partner of Kitt's character Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won Emmy's award.
Couple married in June 2018 at the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% leap in the number of new cases of people living with HIV and the past.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change in the previous situation.
In the past, HIV has usually rapidly spread to some parts of China as a result of a virus-infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, from year to year, the number of people in China living with HIV has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a hot issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been considered illegal since 1997 in China, but they say that the discrimination of LGBT is very widespread.
Studies estimate that due to conservative country perceptions, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men end up in marriage to women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff had published information about the Republican senators, condemning "hazardous lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
US MP Maxine Waters denied the statement that one of her staff has published personal data from three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia sites of these legislators.
The Democratic MP from Los Angeles claims that these claims are posted by experts and the website of the ultra-trading wing.
"Truths, lies, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter release.
The published information allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and they were published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate commission on sexual harassment instructions against the Supreme Court candidate Bretta Kavanaugha.
The information was published at some point after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publication is linked to the Waters office and published information about its staff member, Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and inaccurate claims - is not responsible for completing this information in any way.
This baseless claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked internet condemnation, which was issued by the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This neglect goes away with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the temper required for a Congressman.
When he accuses someone of something he hasn't done, he can't be angry.
It can't be a trap.
She can't justify the prosecution's motives.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently countered Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh's democrats, who were accused of acting too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running for Waters in the mid-term elections, also announced via Twitter.
"Great thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said her office warned "the appropriate competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that before the law they correspond to all their procedures that are unstable and dangerous to all my staff members."
Review of Johnny English again in action – the blue spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already gone into tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new film with British theme, which can also be applied to this continuation of the French satirical action comedy about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the realization of "Johnny English" and returned to screens in 2011 with "Johnny English: born again".
Will the ironic autosatery about how we are obviously useless be a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, bluish, incapacitated Johnny English rubber face got a new opportunity to blow something – with his name more than anything he said was a general comic creation designed for cinema-based audiences whose English is not a mother tongue.
It's, of course, about a foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims at the highest glamour, carries a little Clouseau, the trolley of Mr. Bean and the blizzard of that guy who played only one note in the context of the thematic melody of the achievement of the "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It was also originally founded on a passenger and an international man by the veil of secret that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the newest YE capture are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter trained in the medieval Viscian armor and when the rotor blades briefly whistle about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor feels weak and in a very strange way superior, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and the Invincible Mission add comic elements.
I think it's about children's humor, not adults, and for me the crazy adventures of Johnny English aren't inventive and made up like Atkinson's gays in the style of fancy movies like Mr. Bean.
Now it's a very current topic that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Hacker infiltrated the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, at the horror of the agent on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a glass of water for a prime minister, a pumped and affected person who already has a complete breakdown due to the political popularity fall: Emma Thomson masterfully played this character based on the example of Theresa May, but the scenario is rather inconceivable.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies are compromised and that they will have to hire one of the pensioners.
And that's what Martin Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a distinguished institution, but informally holds lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gays when English holds a spying academy in the way of the School of Hands movie.
English quickly returns to Whitehall for urgent instructions and to recompute it with a former extremely patient partner, Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to the commander of the submarine in whose energetic and loud role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus Batman and Robin are once again serving the secret service of Her Majesty and fortunately a beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletin, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: criminal Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are starting their departure from comical adventures: crushed into a barber, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, a real chaos crashing on Voltina's luxury yacht, and English is running a real anarchy trying to get to know the inside Voltina's house using virtual reality headphones.
It's obvious that a great effort has been made in that last sequence, but no matter how sympathetic and happy the whole film was made for the children.
Pretty middle quality.
As in other movies about Johnny English, I can't ask myself: can the British film industry have any role to play for Rwaat Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to make a British plan to work for four days a week, and to be paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyna will consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but were paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to transfer time to workers who save thanks to the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) by giving them another day off.
The employees would enjoy that kind of weekend – but they would still receive the same pay.
The sources say that this idea would "apply" to the economic programme of the party and plans to improve the working conditions and rights of workers.
A four-day shift to work week approved the Syndical Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: "New policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day work week is an ambition that fits in the party's approach to economic rebalancing in favour of workers, as well as the party's industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this ambition does not support the entire Labour Party.
Portparol Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it".
The opposition officer John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to explain his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined in his desire to take power from the hands of "unbelievable directors" and "professors" in municipal companies.
The plans of the opposition office also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not recover their total investment because the labs could put "debts" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company committees and create inclusive own funds that would allocate 10 per cent of the company's value in the private sector to employees for which it is likely to kill annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about a 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugha postponed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question whether the investigation of the bureau could have led some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the author of the 60-minute show Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy felt more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think so, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, I asked, 'Did you do that?'
He was unstoppable, determined, unscrupulous."
But Senator Graham's voice appears to be embellished.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh was formed and a strong accusation would be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was energetically denying it," Graham added, saying about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she calls can't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the festival of the citizens of the world, and did he do anything that would reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of World Citizens, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars that will take place, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the big lawn of the Central Park who will not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the global project against poverty, an international group dedicated to eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if you are not willing to pay for the VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, phone call and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the project of the World's Citizens with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Was the idea of awarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another vision of so-called "clickivism" – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, citizens of the world have claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who have relied on a number of different objectives.
They say these actions have forced world leaders to publish promises and political directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and the publication of proceeds from their actions, and at least 10 billion dollars have already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are Power nutrition, an investor's partnership and a developer from Great Britain who promised to "help children grow up to their full potential", promising that Rwanda will allocate 35 million dollars to stop feeding in that country, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, the donor, the national governments and the citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social injustice of nutrition become a historical background," said Ambassador Power of Power, Tracey Ullman, live concert visitors to London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions that called for Britain to improve mother and children's rearing, the government announced that it would finance the Power of Nutrition project, whose interventions would affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on their page, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The people of this world say, "It will be a long and difficult time, and sometimes we will fall and fall.
However, like all the big moves for citizens' rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists that will take place at this year's New York event, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in the export of energy to the Navy – secretary of internal affairs
Washington can "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, has discovered Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of Interior, and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russian engagement in Syria – i.e., there are legitimate government calls – is an excuse for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official's statement, there are ways and means of resolving this issue.
"The United States has this option to ensure that the sea corridors remain open together with our sailor or block them, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event whose organizer was the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group called itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, finding it to be the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia consists less and more of the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying that Russia has only one ingredient, and that its nature depends on fossil fuels.
Statements are coming after the Trump Administration's mission to increase exports of oiled natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, would have made Berlin a "teacher" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars and that the existing capacity of the pipeline should be doubled to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively a natural project.
The Kremlin claims that the causes of Washington's fierce opposition to this project are purely economical and that this represents an example of disloyal competition.
"I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing a supplier," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. state called for Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its definition for the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the German Industry Alliance (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country blends into our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Alliance (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" about the presidential candidacy for 2020," state senator Massachusetts said
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" to run for the president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the city council in the city of Hollywood in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," she said, and transmits the source The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for the president."
Warren called on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city hall, saying he "takes this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was summoned for criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court Judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the results of the poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of the electoral bodies voted for Warren did not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will "probably" vote in Massachusetts state said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of voters supporting the potential candidacy and 48 percent against the candidacy.
The other sound names from a series of Democrats discussed in terms of their potential candidates in 2020 are former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin was talking about the PTSP track Palin in full support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the September recruitment.
He was arrested and charged with family violence after a Monday night incident
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after his return, can be linked to what is happening to other families suffering the effects of the PTSP and the vulnerability that our soldiers are returning to," said the public at the gathering of President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a hot topic" and, speaking of his son and other war veterans, added "they return a little differently, return more firmly, they return asking whether there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done, and all other members of the army have given for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence -- assault on a woman person, disruption of reporting violence in the family and possession of weapons under opiates, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Administration.
18 countries, D.C. support the fight against new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a new U.S. policy that undermines asylum for victims fleeing gangs or family violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the District submitted a friendly trial report in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who challenge this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's trial against Sessions, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the Federal Police, has not been discovered.
She said she was abused by her partner "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was kept in custody in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace explained how the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, are facing a growing problem related to gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled the 2014 decision of the Committee on Immigration Complaints, which allowed immigrants who do not have documents and flee from family violence to submit an asylum application.
State Prosecutor District Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement he made Friday that a new policy "is neglecting the decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum requests be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and that the chamber thus violates that principle," the friendly report says.
Lawyers continue in the report claim that the police that disables entry of immigrants is damaging the US economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force."
State Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in cases related to migrants to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing violence in the family and gang violence.
"Assil is only available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or a certain social group or for their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement of 11 June speaking about politics.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palu as the number of dead doubles in search of survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation centre in the deserted city of Pala.
‘Emergency assistance shall be imported by the bodies every minute.
The government is depriving clean water."
People are returning to their broken homes, wandering about in the floodwaters trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the patients were devastated by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
Some of the wounded like the Two Harris who have broken their back and shoulder, are located outside the Palu's Military Hospital, where patients are being assisted outside due to continued severe back-up stress.
His eyes are filled with tears as he tells how he felt a strong earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I think I was pushed down by a ruinous wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help and then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of committing "violent violence"
Seven days after official Chinese newspapers published an ad on four pages in U.S. newspapers, thanks to the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump addressed a paid supplement of China's Daily newspaper in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspapers in Iowa, after accusing China of joining the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to get involved in the American elections indicates that US officials told the agency Reuters, a new phase in a escalating campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
And while it's customary for governments to publish ads aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in the escalating trade war where each other increases import tariffs.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were directed towards exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, said in Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Mayor of Iowa, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the Sunday issue of the newspaper Des Moines Register, "now doubles this violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the government of China is exploiting the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing paid ads in the newspaper Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, on the kiosk located here down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have on the problematic natural path of China, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under the firm heel of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers has refused an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspapers are concerned.
Republicans turn women away from voting in the eyes of mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent Republicans who defend themselves and stand with a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, facing several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense, and most Republicans already show that they want to give their voice.
There is no back in these things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Maxwell University of Syracuse, in an article for the magazine published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that what Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) recently asked the FBI to investigate would be enough to silence angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and public speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators called for "November coming!" during the demonstration in the Senate hall, while the Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to investigate with Kavanaugha's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous," said the news of Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's already high, which is correct.
But it could be higher, especially among undecided female voters in suburbs and among younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who do not like the president, do not vote."
Even prior to Fordov's public testimony, in which she filed details of the allegations of alleged sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts were of the opinion that negative reactions could occur if Republicans investigate the nomination.
"This has become a big mess for the Great Old Party," said Michael Steele, a former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, broadcasts the NBC News network.
"It is not only the Committee's vote or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also the way the Republicans dealt with this issue and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, the leader of the Prioritys USA Group, who supports the choice of Democrats.
Yet, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided in terms of whom to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with easy slope on the side of Kavanaugh.
The new YouTube survey shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought that Kavanaugh probably lied or definitely during his testimony, while only 30% said that they thought the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford and at least one other person who filed the charge, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez allegedly claims that she was shown her genitals by a candidate for the Supreme Court's trial while attending parties during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
Web inventor World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet that will exceed Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup aimed at becoming a competitor of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, the manufacturer of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee felt that the intention of Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store on the network" or POD (personal online data store).
It can contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique for a personal data store on the network is that it depends entirely on the user who can access any kind of information.
The company calls it "personally strengthening through data."
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that the Inrupt company provides the sources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's security platform, a number of employees of development engineers engaged to work on the volunteer project and community.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models over the night will be completely destroyed.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a statement on Saturday on the Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruptova "is a mission to secure commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The last few months of Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although Inrupt is running, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration on the occasion of the Victorian Crusade of a priest assigned to World War I
Celebrations in honor of the only Anglican priest who was distinguished by the Victorian cross as a fighter in World War I was placed in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for an attack at the towns of Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won the biggest British military recognition.
On a parade held Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a memorial plaque.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the resurrection for which his grandfather received the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire from combat and military fire."
Later, he rushed to the fiery line and led the "most heroism" ahead before he ran without any help to the Polish top and cut three out of the military squad.
Lieutenant Vanna killed the German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never achieve, but also something that causes humility."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed the winery after the parade led by the Dutch orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels honored to participate in paradise" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give."
MMA fans who stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got Pepu Prase
Imagine that, you've been awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206, so you can't finally be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and showed live during the night on Channel 5 in Great Britain.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just the moment when the Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the viewers in Britain were amazed when the transfer ended Pepa Prase.
Many were not impressed that they stayed up all night until early morning just because of the fight.
One Twitter fan described this interruption as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's about the government's rule that this content is inappropriate at 6 o'clock in the morning, and they had to replace it with a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president Bellator for marketing and communication, on the transfer issue.
"Pepa Prase," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think when I talk about reprisal, I think we can probably solve it," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to accomplish anything until we have Sunday, when they already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the break came, they circled the inscriptions and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government jurisdiction.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We'll reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've exceeded.
It's one unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old said that only in high school did he realize that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, representing Lauren Laverne, he said he openly spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that what became a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular manager of the long - term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for a few months because of the disease.
Appearing as a waste in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" to others during his growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferior worth and the feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medals became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly and because he wanted to give others "hope."
The triple world champion said that he was in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 "surprisingly."
Daley married an Oscar winner last year, who was 20 years older than him, and said that the difference in years was never a problem.
"When you live so much while you're so young" -- the first time he showed up at the Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it's hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar upheavals and falls.
Couples took the role of Robert Ray Black-Daley's boy's parents in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was just about "I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son wears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 in the year 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets for London in 2012.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had been dreaming of all my life -- swimming in front of the home audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his selection of the first song -- the Spring of Heather Small -- which responded to him while he was preparing for the Olympics and from which the twins still pass.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 after British summer time.
Mickelson from the shape of a club at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he'll have to recover the form so this wouldn't be an unveiling switch.
Mickelson, who plays on the record track 12th time, Captain Jim Fury has sent to the club in Saturday games with four balls and games in four.
Instead of being in the center of action, as it was often the case for the United States, the fifth major winner spent the day in cheering and improving the field in the game, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for the Le Golf National demand field, where long unbalanced terrain regularly punishs stray hits.
And if I'm not scared enough, Mikkelson is in the ninth game on Sunday with British Open, French Molinary champion, who won all four of their games this week with Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 single games with four points less, come to a hot start, the Mickelson game could prove absolutely decisive.
Fury said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't even say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, sunk me in the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Fury said.
“He has strong faith in himself.
He's a member of the House of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I figured there'd be more, but that's how it went and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
That could mark the end of his career at Ryder's shop where he never fully achieved the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Fury said his presence brought a certain immaterial value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have such a guy on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than the puck of the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of the individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
Days first appeared at a game played in the city of Valderram in 1997, when the party whose captain was Seva Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but ended the competition with a marked difference of 141⁄2-131/2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," said Bjorn, imagined after watching the 2018 team, who won the result 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going to finish tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the table.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I've been talking all along, I've been focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's over-way on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players at the heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added, "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
They're on the line tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're testing the final possibilities of yourself as a golfer.
It's a message you have to convey to the players - give the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to do the best of his own."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Fury will ask his players to play better individually than they played in couples, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Surik himself was on both sides of these great revolutions the last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe carried out "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, a 1999 captain, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important swords tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning, like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When it comes to such a advantage, he creates a great pressure on the middle game.
We formed our position in line with that and we've prepared the guys so we can try to do some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to run a counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this position because I think she can cover up until the end," Bjorn said about choosing a single player.
New German warship waiting again
The new frigate of the German Navy was to be released in 2014 in order to replace old warships from the Cold War, but will not reach for at least another year due to system failure and extraordinary costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a leading ship in the class of entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoted military speakers.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg sailboats ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen frigates.
As well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures, will have a strong top, a series of air and anti-ship missiles.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for the latest frigates to be deployed up to two years without returning to the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were to allow Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will be obsolete when they begin to use, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate arrived last year in the newspaper, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Bohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
A little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have quoted a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would have caused the ship, if it had been deployed in a combat mission, to be useless.
Software deficiencies were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will run a crew of 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who run the old Bremen fleets.
It also proved that the ship is a significant overload that reduces its impact and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to incorrect hardware, the cost of a complete project, including staff training, is also becoming problematic.
It is said that it has reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
Problems related to the latest frigates are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy actually "is becoming ships that can be arranged."
The officer said that this problem grew over time, because old ships were signed off, and there were no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the Frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of a Squirrel
A new study carried out on one property in the hills of Scotland aims to discover how bats use locality in search of food.
Results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the Scottish National Fund will follow the usual bats and the species of soprano Pipistrelle, and the brown long bats and bats of the Daubenton species in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
The special recording devices will be installed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
Employees and NHS volunteers will also perform mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calls to bats and what they do.
The map of the sites and the report will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the local level.
Rob Dewar, a Nature Conservation Adviser in NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important bats and how each species benefits them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on housing management, such as the creation of meadows, and the best way to maintain forest for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK have significantly decreased over the past century.
They are threatened by works of construction and development, which have a negative impact on lay and loss of habitat.
Windshields and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical processing of building materials, and attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha of countries across the country, are very serious about bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out checks, lay inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the property of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good properties.
But there's so much more unknown about bats, so what we're doing here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to make progress."
He stresses how important it is to check whether bats are on the property, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother’s bed will kill up to 400 women and young people, likely to result in the extinction of the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals and the law prohibits the killing, abuse, harassment or destruction of their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Shishmish Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate and help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the population of most of our species is developing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers file a complaint against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape, which he was referred to as "false news", saying that people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who has filed charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rapeing one American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas 2009.
Apparently he paid her $375.000 to stop this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his followers, who were 142 million in a video recording on the Instagram Live network, a few hours after the charges report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the reports, calling them "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-fold winner of the Golden Ball said in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get to glory by talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these remarks, which they called "an unacceptable report on the doubts in the area of privacy," according to the Reuters agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "unmaterial damage in terms of the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The accident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her, according to documents delivered to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% good guy" who failed those "1%."
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he was willing.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but that she later agreed to the extrajudicial agreement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated."
34-year-old says she's now looking for a cancellation because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the brink of going to Real Madrid from Manchester, at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he went to the Italian jungle of Juve for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will "suffer forever" if it loses the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that what Toyota UK said to BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in case Bexit remains without an agreement could cause job losses.
The Toyotin Auris and Avensis factory from Burnston produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March we will see stopping production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyote in Burnston.
Other UK producers, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed fear of how cross-border trade would work if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main fears relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the purchase chain in the Brexit case without agreement.
The Toyote production line operates in principle "just in time", where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it can come to an end on the frontier which can lead to a delay and a lack of parts for industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies longer than one day in its factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so that production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the "Checkers" plan that offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will enable me to say, not only to enjoy the present success, but also to seize this opportunity," Radio 4 today told the BBC.
"The example not only of Toyote but also of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been extremely successful in the supply chain."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned that long-term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and ultimately reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and the president of the Union's union in the factory, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when such jobs are closed, they never return again.
The government spokesperson said: "We must draw up a precise and convincing plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, they say from the White House.
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "appreciated for another week" because the fight against the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh continued, said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the potential interference of justice by the president.
Whether Trump's gonna fire a Deputy Attorney General or not, and that's why it's threatening Mr. Mueller's independence, but it's been in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein also spoke about ringing to record talks with Trump and about the possibility of changing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these rumors.
But last Monday he was in the White House, in the middle of a rumor that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "do not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid interfering with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission on which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered the FBI to investigate a charge against Kavanaugh for a week on Friday, which further postponed the Senate's vote in full.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox News channel Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she answered: “The date for this is not yet fixed, it could be this week, and it could be delayed for another week, having in mind all the other things that are happening in connection with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would reject this claim: Sandersova has not made a brief speech for journalists in the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that a smaller number of short speeches were not the result of the "theatrical behavior" of the TV reporter, although he said, "I will agree with the fact that they exaggerate."
Then she said she'd strengthen direct contact between Trump and the reporters.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," said without giving evidence: "We have seen those numbers."
A brief discussion will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to directly question the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it as much as you have seen us do it for the past few weeks, and these talks with the President of the United States will change the short talk to reporters."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences during an official visit.
The individual press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the assembled reporters, it is unscrupulous and sometimes strange.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU employees working in Scotland's NHS to express the gratitude of the state and the desire to remain after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the EU from the UK.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to meeting the costs of the EU citizens' status claims that work in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "The talks between the UK and the EU on withdrawal are ongoing during the summer, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know that for all of you, this was a very restless time.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and more, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after a head injury
The defense team State Tigers Tennessee, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in Saturday's defeat 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores club, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Master Coach Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the afternoon.
"He came to the field line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it on the carrier and taking it to further examination.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville channel, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed an operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no detail on the type/species of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a student of the second year in red dress, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total turns on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 turns in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher real estate fees in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will be charged higher rates when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds being used to help homeless people with new conservation plans
This move will neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
Higher taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged higher rates when purchasing real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will be published today.
This step will be considered by trying to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved by trying to attract young voters to promises that it will ensure more affordable housing care and focus on those who make more money.
More fees will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, thereby strengthening the government's intention to fight open sleep.
The additional fee, which is in addition to the existing tax, including more levels, introduced two years ago to the second real estate and the purchase for rental, could be up to 3%.
The vault expects this move to increase income to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London buy people who do not have a home in the UK, which is why the prices are rising, and buyers who buy real estate for the first time are becoming harder to become homeowners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "the cities of spirits" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help a larger number of young people come to their first home.
He accused construction companies of holding high real estate prices buying at the first opportunity of a land they do not use, and asked Mrs May to give up the access home quota as soon as possible in order to end the British "hungry of housing policy."
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rentals and the suspension of any associated investments.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the prime minister to return the British dream - that every new generation's life should be better.
And that means repairing our poor housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it can't be right that individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as companies, can easily buy houses as well as valuable British people.
The dream of ownership over the house has become too far for many people, and inhuman sleep on the open and still quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish representation at a certain time.
Forty-two-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a club from the northeast, which is currently in the third place in the First League, with three points less than the leader.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after last season returned St. Mirren to the Scottish Prime Minister League.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was in the B team, and that was it," Ross said for the BBC Scotland Sports Sound show.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be provided if I were successful in running the club."
Rose's predecessors as Sanderland's managers include Dick Advocata, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neilla, Roy Keane, Gus Poyeta and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic Club said he didn't feel peace because he came after such great names in such a big club, after he refused to offer Barnsley and Ipswich Town Clubs.
"The measure of my success at this moment will be 'will I be able to get this club back to the League of Prime Ministers?'
Judging by the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I'll be able to be successful only if I can get the club back to where it belongs."
Ros is only in the third year of his managerial career, after a period that he spent as chief assistant in Damascus and 15 months spent as part of Harts' training staff.
He then helped Allo recover from falling into the third category, and St. Miren withdrew from the ranks of the lower league to the winner of the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirrena and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real intersection," recalled the reception of Allo's club.
"I sincerely believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I made a decent profit, and I enjoyed some solid success.
But playing can be hard.
It's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just fits me.
I've always wanted to deal with management and now I've been doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my whole adult life than I do now."

The perfect time for the cup is Saturday at 17:30, discovers research
The summer wave of heat increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased pressure on the launch of the restaurant.
In the pubs and bars group, sales grew from 2.7% in July, but the traffic in restaurants fell by 4.8%, as the figures show.
Peter Martin, from CGA's consulting company, who collected the data, said: “Sustainably sunny time and longer than expected participation in England at the World Cup contributed to July following a similar pattern as in the previous month of June, when the pubs grew by 2.8%, and the restaurants had even more falls.
The drop in traffic in restaurants from 1.8% in June just got worse in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinks achieved far the best result with greater growth compared to the comparable results of the previous period, rather than the drop in traffic in restaurants.
The pubs focused on food also suffered because of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars there was an increase in the sale of drinks by 6.6% for a month, with a fall in the sale of food by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the Agency for the Analysis of Entertainment Content and Entertainment of RSM, said: “These results continue to be a trend that we have witnessed since the end of April.
Time opportunities and the impact of major social and sporting events are still the main factors when it comes to selling on the market outside the household.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the drop in sales of 4.8% at the annual level will be particularly ill with already existing price pressures.
Long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused customers, and time would show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a little over the necessary relief."
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow introduction of new brand growth.

Every fifth child has a secret task on social networks that he hides from his parents
Every five children, some of whom have only 11 years of age, have a secret task on social networks that hides from their parents and teachers, discovers research
Research involving more than 20,000 pupils in higher education revealed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
This news increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent said he had a "main" job showing his parents.
Every fifth child, one of whom is only 11 years old, has a real job on social networks he hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 students in higher education revealed a sudden increase in "false Insta" tasks, referring to the Instagram photo sharing website.
That news strengthened the fear of the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the pupils said they had a clean "main" job showing their parents, but they also had private tasks.
One mother who came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl calling out to others with the words "violate me."
Research carried out by the UK Digital Awareness and Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private tasks.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It upsets the fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of that administrative body.
Doyle is the most rewarding Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from her rich experience at international level over the past decade
"Eilid enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sportsman's voice and hope that I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
An American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including a 200-400-metre win in the 1996 games in the Atlantic, and now a regular expert on BBC, remained unmoved after experiencing a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can show if I'm going to recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages."
Advertising for a publisher whose mothers share their views on the Internet
The company that produces traitors shared their views on the Internet advertising that breast-feeds the cow muzaras.
To mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent traitor", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom that new pumps provide to mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between the shadows and cows with a song whose text reads: "Yes, I am married but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not yours, it's my breasts."
The following refren: "Fump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, husband myself."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, he saw different reactions from the viewers, while many said he was throwing light on the "horrible" dairy industry.
"The use of cows for advertising this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and give birth to us to produce milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after birth," someone wrote.

Another commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why don't we use it to advertise a traitor to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Advertising without any sense."
The others stood up to defend the ad, and one woman admitted that her song was "angrily."
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I still felt it.
Because of the betrayal, I felt just like a cow.
Ad's a little silly, but I figured it out.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This funny advertising is directed to mothers who issue milk (usually at work or in the toilet) and feel like "requirements".
This isn't a advertising that praises or robs the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, the pump Elvie is completely insensitive, has no wire or tube and stands in the breast for breast-feeding, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while they deliver milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother’s company, commented: “The Elvie Pump is so revolutionary a product that it deserves a decent and provocative launch.
By withdrawing the parallel between breast and cow muzara we wanted to focus on the issue of milk and all the challenges that go along with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump got to the news headlines.
During the Seven Fashions in London, the mother of two children appeared on the track in the creation of Marte Jakobowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children held by migrants has increased, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to find caregivers for children.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were migrants without documents that were afraid of endangering their ability to remain in the country by stepping up to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, said last week before Congress that this service arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of minors without escorting.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not been convicted.
"Approximately 80% of the persons who are either caregivers or members of the household of the caregivers are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we'll continue looking for those people, Mr. Albence said.
In order to ensure that children pass through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules that some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, said workers in the reception.
Many will come forward with a call instead of a personal call to ask the immigration judge to enforce his status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer children stay closed, the greater the chances are that they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to an outbreak of anger or an attempt to escape, the workers of receptions and reports that have arrived from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks have been raised in larger institutions such as those in the town of Tornillo, where it is much easier to predict signs indicating that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can cause the trauma many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks urgent withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return, although the war in that country has lasted for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the forces were illegal in the Syrian country, in the words of the fight against terrorism and "will be counted accordingly."
They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that in Syria "war on terrorism is almost over", where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "the holy fight until we exploit all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly responsible for training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country with a broken war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said there were good conditions for their return and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until Assad and the opposition reach agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting up a tampons zone in the last major rebel rebellion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a major attack by the Syrian forces supporting Russia in the province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that a military action against jihadist and combatants from Nusra's front related to Al-Qaida would be launched, which would "be exhausted".
The UN Staffan de Mistura envoy hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of the new committee consisting of the authorities and members of the opposition in order to create a draft post-election constitution for Syria and prepare a path to the elections.
Moualem outlined the Government of Syria's terms of participation in the committee's work, saying that the work of that body should be limited to "the consideration of members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be chosen for second term
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, for what many liberal observers are likely to hope, the objection and scandal did not break his mandate earlier.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of the presidential mandate of all time!"
So far, there's no sign of the eyebrows.
Since 2014, the impact-term rating has doubled by more than 1.05 million on the CNN channel and almost tripled by 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to the Nielsen agency, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hit period, unlike four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and the show Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC exceeded the rating of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with hit news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer's producer of the "Old Survivors" drama on the ABC channel, about the government secretary who becomes the president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few of the raw truths about entering the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, "because he smiles at me," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has fun value, too.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on abortion from Roe's proceedings against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what will be the state of global prosperity.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that you were watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep background" for his book "Strah," about Paul Manafort's jacket, worth $15,000 (“Department with a bold attitude of babacity”, wrote Washington Post) and the implications of picturesque descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr. Trump giving Storm Daniels.
I, for example, will never look Super Maria with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that I feed you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Zalagaonica show, commenting on the rotation of the acting position and the daily complications of Trump's show (criticizing the American football league, praise Kim Jong-un).

When I arrived at Mr. Fless this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauaija, it was sunny at a temperature of about 80 degrees (27°C), but he closed himself inside and watched MSNBC and recorded CNN.
He could not be separated from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Justice Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large cash flows from the side in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that 17th-century Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redeployment of Congressional Districts that resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent border crossing of the district in Pittsburgh pre-city led to the election of Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who came to the head of the other county after the extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is fighting against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th county of Pennsylvania, which is heavily intertwined with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old circuits were continuously formed for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign to finance the campaign between the main party fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after his final victory in the broad-eyed special elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congression in March.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point pre-emption district.
Political analysts gave little advantage to democracies.
The United States is considering the punishment of El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdraws
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little encouragement from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting in June 2017 with the president of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson for the Department, in a statement in the beginning of the month.
However, the penalties were considered only for El Salvador, which was estimated to have received US$ 140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and the target thresholds, would hardly hit this Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings have progressed, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which should be the continuation of a similar year-long set that represented a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that they actually interrupted any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the administration attachs to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or sentences from Washington.
Speaker of the White House, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal debates on the condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next he prepares could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible prosecution of the judiciary, which now contains significant evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller also directed his investigation to discover a possible link between Trump's campaign and Russia's election attack.
If most changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face the responsibility of that body, just when he is prepared to step back to the electorate, and perhaps even before the jury.
He's very quiet, though, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall, nor those in Europe that are similar to him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, the German soldiers were ready to execute a coup against Hitler, only to the West oppose and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the casualties that followed.
The course of history revolves around such breakthroughs, and the unmistakable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now faced with more of these breakthroughs.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires a deputy chief, Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an immediate position ever since this letter last year reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president and suggested that he was not similar to performing the function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the statement from the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if a recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for the Congress that Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we're not going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I am an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for the Sabbath on that table with a cuckoo cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before face-to-face with Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers are on Thursday host Rapid from Vienna, knowing that they will be won over the Austrians, after an impressive rhyme in Spain against Villarrela at the beginning of this month, to put themselves in a good position to qualify from the Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the associate player Graham Dorrans from debiting this season until the unresolved match with the 2-2 final score, but he is convinced that Rangers can use that result as a jumping board for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and we went with the point.
Maybe we could finally take them, but all in all, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back in the second, and we were better.
We are again expected to have a great European evening on Thursday.
We hope that we can take three points, but it will be a difficult match because they had a good result in the last game, although, with the support of the audience, we can certainly push out and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, starting from everything that happened to my injuries, until the change in the club itself, but now we're satisfied with what we have right now.
The team is in good shape and the guys really enjoy; we're good at training.
I hope we'll be able to continue now, leave the past season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep worried about saving their pension
Despite the fact that the students had a clear idea of how they would want to care for them, a few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people involved in the nationwide research said they talked to their husbands about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about it.
"People want someone from the family to be old about them, but they don't want to start talking about it," says Holly Snyder, vice-president of the sector for life insurance in the Nationwide company.
Here's where it starts.
Speak with your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to give it to you, because such decisions can be a significant factor in price fixing.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your long-term funding choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that would help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Manage your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the root.
Make authorization to make medical assistance decisions so that you have a trusted person who will monitor the medical care provided to you and ensure that health workers act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the conclusion of a full-power finance contract.
This means choosing a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and try to pay your bills if you are not able to.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs urgent medical attention and is being taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not only about the finances, it's also about who the doctors are?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with more hits from an Ilfracombe air rifle
One man was shot with several shots from an air rifle while walking home from the night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 according to British summer time, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died a strong earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, officials reported, and the number of dead is expected to grow.
As a result of the breakup, relief officials could not obtain any information from the province of Dongala, a region north of Palu, which is close to an epicenter of magnitude 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Palu and Dongal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It reached a county extending over 300 km (180 miles) to the north of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administratively lower rank than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture form the basis of the nature of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel miners are also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Paul and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
The tsunami hit the west of Dongal in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6,8 degrees hit south Java, the most populated Indonesian island, by launching tsunamis that ravaged the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 degrees struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the deadly destruction of earthquakes and tsunamis from 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the building.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 people lost their lives, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the basis of suspicion that he committed violence in the family, prevented the reporting of violence in the family and opposed arrest, a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police Agency.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in Mat-Su's detention unit and he had a $500 parole claim, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where on the question of explanation of guilt he explained that "surely not guilty," the network said.
Palin is faced with three Class A violations, which means he's threatened with a prison sentence up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also accused of a Class B violation, which is punishable by a prison sentence for one day and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time they've been tried against Palina.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is now before the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of family violence, of disturbing the reporting of domestic violence and of possession of weapons in an alcoholized state linked to the incident.
His girlfriend said she was hit in the face.
Saru Palin criticised the Veteran Group in 2016 after bringing his son's violent behaviour with PTSP after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Earthquakes of 7.5 degrees that caused tsunamis destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been a disruption of connections and power supply, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was directly along the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarte.
On social networks, video recordings show a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palo when the tsunami flooded the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death sentence for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died -- a rare sentence that has not been carried out for federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used the rented truck home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he selected pedestrians and bikers who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious bodily injury, a request for the execution of the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York, is made.
According to both of these points, it is possible to impose a death penalty, as stated in the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Supreme Court accused Saipova of 22 counts of charges involving eight counts of murder and recruitment, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "greed, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca", a request for execution is made.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South New York District last had a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a New York federal case was executed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy in order to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police told him.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to execute the attack, it was reported in the indictment.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
It turns out he's not guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said they were clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting a life imprisonment without the possibility of freeing the guilty, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to utter a death sentence.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for talks about Brexit
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the national army" during a protest at the conservative conference.
Former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "sympathize with the dissatisfaction" of Eurosceptics, since one of the Members of Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said at a meeting in Birmingham that the UK would "be gone" until now that Mr. Farage was secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May faced in trying to unite her deep-separate ranks highlighted conservatives who advocate the EU's stay and joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks and attacks by supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they continue with attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between its package and "haosa".
Mr. Bone said at the meeting Go to Solihul means to go to Solihul that he wants to "reject Chequers".
He proposed that Mr Farage should be given a title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were chief, we'd be out by now," he said.
An envoy from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Explaining its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our laws into our country."
Mr. Bone has rejected the statement that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed the opinion and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
Brexitian Andrea Jenkins, who also attended the meeting, told reporters: “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in general, the opposition won't vote for it, it's not popular in our stranger and among our activists who were actually those who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please reject the plan from the Chequers and start listening."
In a strong message, Mrs. May added: "The prime ministers succeed in keeping their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage told the gathered that politicians should make themselves "sigh dissatisfaction" if they were to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - people and our political elites," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "that won't happen to you."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, on the edge of Brexit’s edition, to feel discontent.
"We are mobilizing the national army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, survivors marched through Birmingham before holding a two-way assembly in the city center.
Several activists waved the "Torieves Against Brexit" transparent after forming a group this weekend.
Laborist Lord Adonis complained to the conservatives about the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plan, for the unmistakable state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit is not possible," he added.
Warren's planning to seriously consider a candidate for the president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously consider candidates for the president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that a family member from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a participant meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, the honorary critic of President Donald Trump, again applied for elections in November against the Republican representative at Geoffa Diehl's House of Representatives, who was co-chairing Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.

The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electors, which used the participatory format of the meeting since Trump reached duty.
One of those present asked if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren turned down how it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman on the front."
Arrested after LSU Sims was shot.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday the arrest of the shooting suspect who was killed by LSU Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of Ditheon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 at the press conference.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was published, seeking help in finding the man that is seen on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.

Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the order guarantees him victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team's order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and calling on Vettel to attack his team member.
Vettel first went to the box and left Hamilton behind to get involved in traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action a point from the point that the Ferrari driver was reluctant to leave the free interior with the risk of delay after a double move in defence of the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of bars and was the seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran a major part of the race, relying on his tires to reach the swift end and passed Kimie Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally got into a box in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was the real gentleman that let me pass.
Tim did a really great job to achieve a one-two formation finish," said Hamilton.
That was a very bad body speech.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinsten at a rally on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford in a public letter in which a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are wicked, lowly and lying.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and pitiful and lying, he said.
When you look at the announcements and information that have been leaked into the public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leave information to the public?
You remember her answer. Did you leave the document to the public? What?
Oh, no.
I didn't let the public go."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July with details on Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September - yet Feinsten testified that the information was being smuggled out of her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't let her story in public." she told Feinstein's board, reports Hill.
She asked me to keep it in secret, and I kept it in secret, as she asked."
But her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who said on a Wednesday Saturday night: To tell you, it was really a bad speech by the body.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
By continuing his defense against the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that the democrats use them for their own purposes.
They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see the evil, the shame, they don't care who's gonna hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," the media conveys the words of the president.

More than 800 people died, and many are watering themselves like disappeared after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering tsunamis.
Strong renegade earthquakes continue to strike this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Pala Airport, which was heavily floating.
He remained to ensure safe flight of Batika Air Flight 6321, which was standing on the runway at the time.
When he realized that the control tower was falling apart, he jumped out of it.
He passed by later in the hospital.
Portparol Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirate, said his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
Our hearts are broken because of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the State Agency for Disaster Relief indicates that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims continues to grow, since numerous bodies are still below the ruins, and many cannot reach," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman said.
The waves that reached the height and up to six meters devastated Pala, where a mass burial will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: She drove emergency services every minute to import bodies.

Small stores are stealing everywhere."
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: The Red Cross of Indonesia is rapidly working to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to get there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia's President Yoko Widodo arrived in Pala on Sunday and ordered the army of that country: Of all, I ask you to work all day long to carry out all the tasks relating to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia hit an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year in which more than 550 people were killed.
The fall of a plane in Micronesia: Air Niguini reports that after the fall of a plane in the lagoon, one face is turned missing.
The airline whose aircraft crashed in a pacific lagoon in Micronesia reported that one face was missing, after it earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that was ton.
Air Niugini in the statement says that as of Saturday afternoon they are not able to trace the passenger.
The airline reports that in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and researchers, they are working on finding this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced Friday that seven faces were transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that on Saturday, another six passengers were detained in the hospital and that everyone was in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what was the outcome.
And the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane ended up in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some folks think the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to break through to the exit for a case of danger through the water that hit them to the line in the plane that was towing.
He said that the crew was panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that mariners working nearby at the port repair site also helped rescue the boat at the flood that passengers crossed to the shore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
Air Safety Network data indicate that in the accidents of a company registered in PNG in the past two decades, 111 people were lost, but none of them participated in Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructs the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended the case on Saturday in a repeated proceedings against a man accused of burning a live woman in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst at the US Justice Ministry Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
Before the jury, he said he used cell phone data to draw a picture of the move of the defendant Quinton Tellis, aged 29, and the victims of Jessica Chambers, aged 19, on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received information about the location from several phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time when he was, according to his own claims, with a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to examine Sanford.
Sanford testifying on Saturday said he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis found that Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
Mobile data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett was that Tellis set a time after Chambers' death from his phone deleted her messages, calls and contact information.
He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin on Sunday with the final words.
The judge said he expected that the trial before the jury would follow later in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What's a enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to challenge the negative attitude towards this genre by fulfilling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip-hop was away from its beginnings when he was dealing with political messages and social themes.
They want to return to their roots and return popularity to the enlightened hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Commons are gaining popularity again in Great Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
The New York nanny is suing a couple for cancellation after a racist text message.
The New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal on a discriminatory basis after she has received a text message from a mother in which she complains that she is another black person."
Couples deny that they are racists, judging the lawsuit as an exaggeration."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed discontent when she realized that she was a new wife of children, Giselle Maurice, black after her first working day in 2016.
Not another black woman," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their ex-wife, who was an African-American, was already doing her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino instead of her, she passed the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a fee for one day's work and a half's sent home.
Maurice now sues for a couple of ransom compensation, as well as a $350 fee per day for six months, on how much she was initially hired to live with her family, even without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she told Post on Friday, adding that it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the charges of racism that the cancellation of Mauritian engagement was reasonable because they feared that after being offended, they would not be able to believe it.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco said to Post's husband.
Would you trust your children who you hurt, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Qualifying the complaint as an exasperation," Plasco said that his wife had only received two months of maternity leave and that she was in a very difficult situation."
You're going after someone like that?
That's not nice," the investment bank added.
Although the trial is still under way, the court of justice was quick in judging the money on social networks, criticizing them for such behavior and thinking.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not be offended by the bear who spoke, the new letter revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It's hard to put in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we know now about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before the little drunk bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked for BBC as a cameraman, was still positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was these men, he didn't like to be praised," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something and you were proud of him, even though it wasn't your duty.
I think he was looking at the success of Paddington in a way like that.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington alone."
My daughter was dying, and we had to forgive ourselves over the phone.
Her daughter was suddenly transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought vainly to save her life.
Nad regularly called to say that it was bad, and that they didn't expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
Then Nad called me to say she was gonna die in the next two minutes and I have to forgive her.
I did it, too.
I said, Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon, too.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her blood flow.
She died just a few moments before that, and everything's turned off.
I could just sit down and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be picked up."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was now in mourning for the death of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, who had not even dreamed of the trouble she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I've got my head down, and my tears are running down my face without stopping.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed with compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes on the big bridge are setting up letters with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression to commit suicide at 18 years of age.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a prospective cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would see every room."
But before he died, he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried that it'll leave any consequences."
Mrs. Davis invented those cards so people would know that there's someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, so even if it was just a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
He didn't say he was indisposed, depressed, or anything else," she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was on the very bottom of Christmas when the children opened their presents and he didn't see them in his eyes or anything else."
She says that his death was a huge trauma to them, but that they have to overcome it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
That'll blow us up.
But we will continue and fight."

With the opening of an FBI investigation, the future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for -- a limited length and scope investigation -- maybe that would bring us together," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding how he feared that the committee would break down because of unresolved party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their discontent is caused by the choice of the moment.
Elections for Congress are held for only five weeks, November 6, and if Republicans pass badly, as expected, their attempts to be elected in the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him also met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
He will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavnaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to decide by his vote and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of escapes from North Korea falls under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Calling for information from the Ministry of the Union of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug stated that last year 1127 escaped as compared to 2011 when that number was 2706.
Mr. Park said two decisive factors were stronger border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by smugglers.
Pyongyang didn't make a public statement.
A large majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a solidly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China is considered to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them.
The relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have been considerably improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss the ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, on which broad consensus was reached that he would work on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the ongoing lack of progress.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it does not come to mind that we are the first to unarm ourselves on the one hand," the RI said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Kavanaugha a hysterical," saying he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh a hysterical" and said he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't think of a woman if she'd ever been so hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he was sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and hugging when he was talking about his family and his high school years,
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the committee, appreciating the allegations against him with a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" that organised liberals to get angry that Hilary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform a function in the Supreme Court because it showed his caution against the harm of the Democrats.
I believe that he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he went against Clintons and Democrats," he said.
On the question of whether he will try to revoke the Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi is exhausted.
I'll say next - if he's not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not just like being in the Supreme Court, but not even in the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge of District District Court of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about any rulings against the Act on Access to Health or in Roe's case against Wade, considering him as a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether to override certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to be put in court and we're expected to say if that's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
A justified anger, an anger that has been heaped up for months and years, and it cannot be resolved without payment.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: She helped me a lot when she was a executive director, and she said she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that made her feel that when she got angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to said that you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then I'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
The tears are allowed a way to get rid of anger in part and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of my earlier work, in the office where most men were, is how I was when I once cried out for the indescribable anger, an older woman - the cold boss I was always a little scared - grabbed at the door and pulled out on the stairs.
I never let them see me crying," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When in 1987, Hart was caught in an out-of-court affair on board the Monecky Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for the president himself.
That was not a well-thought decision," she told me through the smile 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow and seven ducks."
Since the campaign had already slowed down, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she said she wouldn't be in the race if she didn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 would give her just 250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration for the system that made it difficult to collect funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger for the showinism - from which she got into her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're going to put on my memoir?
"She cried?"
How a trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The first cannons of a trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the end of the battle is not yet near, the gap between the countries can long-term be of benefit to Beijing, hard experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, first issued a warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key Chinese export articles including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest hit occurred this week with new tariffs that hit items worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which are practically repaired by half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has returned the same measure every time, and the latest is the introduction of tariffs from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has been promised that the United States will respond to the same measure, and the other, by the size of the world economy, appears not to stop soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to meet the demands, but public service to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, Chinese president.
However, experts claim that, if Beijing is playing its next move well, U.S. pressure in the trade war can sustain China's long-term positive support by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a severe natural fall in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia's Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return to the refugee, foreign minister says.
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country that has been damaged by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have destroyed terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed towards their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the damaged country.
