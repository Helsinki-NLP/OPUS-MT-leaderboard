Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned about "making the figure of strawberries"
Some Members of the Assembly are aware of the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wales Parliament).
This proposal is as a result of the programmes to amend the name of the Assembly in the Galles Parliament.
Members of the whole political arena Assembly are concerned that this can be ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "may make a rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In gallese, twp means cretin and pwp means cock.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group in the complex "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said to be "open" to the change of name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (pagliaccio).
In this context, the letter W in Galese is pronounced in a similar way to the English pronunciation of the Yorkshire letter U.
The Committee on Assembly Affairs, which is currently in the process of introducing amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on possible descriptors of what the members of the Assembly will be called will obviously be a debate for the members themselves."
The law of the Galles Government of 2017 granted the Gales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which registered a broad support for the possibility of calling the Galles Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the House, the Commission has expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Galician Parliament), but the MWP option has received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching the consensus could be a thank-you for President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians turn to the referendum on the amendment of the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country in "North Macedonia Republic."
The popular vote was organised in an attempt to put an end to a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opposer of the plebiscite for the amendment of the name, said that he would not take the result of the vote into account.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to be paid in order to be able to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells sit while Harlem's churches are in trouble
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"Today there's none of the two."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood rooms that people regularly attend."
As for the churches, worry is that the money arising from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by buildings of apartments with condoms filled with the kind of people who will not help the rest of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for this reason they will rush the time when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move in these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by confraterites before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The early white Methodist congregation had gone there in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation with the chief Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycotting against the 125th Street vendors, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, who refused to take or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the "poor bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it in a different way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a colour musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who passed to a larger carillon to the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace it.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the lay leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The Parish Assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of the lay leader, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese "try to download the costs" on the parishioner, although the latter had not been involved in the adoption of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Squalo woundes a tredicenne in dive fishing aragos in California
Official sources say that Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was searching for aragosta in California during the opening day of the Aragosta season.
The attack occurred shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was immersing himself with friends Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swimming up to him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of an aragosta but then "he realized that the boy was screaming ‘I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His entire clavicle was locked," Hammel said he noticed once he reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was found under critical conditions.
The species of the responsible attack squad is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said during a communication to the media that some weeks earlier he had been sighted in the area a shark, but that he had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper thoracic area.
The authorities prohibited access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablanca until Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's programme a push towards the beauty sector in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse dedicated to specialized assistants
As part of the important drive towards the UK's 2.5 billion sterling market, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and household items decrease, the biggest beauty products competitions will be tested in 11 stores in the country and adopted in more shops next year in case of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use space on the cabinets once dedicated to televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double the size of its offer of items for beauty up to the 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most of the products are vegan - an increasingly demanding quality from the younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance dealer The Fragrance Shop will experience the authorizations in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, in southern London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards buying small quantities of food daily at small district stores have forced supermarkets to commit themselves more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the points sold will more and more resemble large stores while the supermarket chain tries to resist discount resistance such as Aldi and Lidl offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also introduced different Habitats since he bought the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has given rise to food sales and has made the most profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reduce its distribution of beauty and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical sales points in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharmaceutical activity of 281 points sold in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four shops of an extensive range of luxury brand for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's said: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specifically trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to respond to all needs and the inviting environment and comfortable locations make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "frustible" after Holly Willoughby shows up from an 11 million sterling agreement
The Dragons Den star, Peter Jones is furious after the TV presentation Holly Willoughby withdrew from a contract of 11 million sterlings with his brand of trend to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of household and True accessories anymore.
The couple's activity was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow's.
The presenter of This Morning, 37 years old, appealed to Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, furiously after withdrawing from their profitability trending activity at the last minute to focus on his new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furnished" when the golden girl on TV admitted to a tessé meeting at the headquarters of her commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - for a value of 1.5 million sterlings - did not leave them enough time to dedicate themselves to their brand of household and accessories True.
The activity was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop's Goop's Goop's Goop's Goop, and it was calculated that it would double the Willoughby's property, estimated around 11 million pounds.
Not only willoughby, 37 years old, chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of True, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday residences.
According to one source, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's highest priority.
It should have been his future over the long term that he would have undertaken for the next 20 years.
His decision to abandon has left all the people involved absolutely without words.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow's general district, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that abandoning the presenter of this Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of the strong investments in products ranging from pillows and household candles and because of possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby invented True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, came to be part of the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together, and Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as a guest of the ITV "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night that "he does not want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "telenal driver".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was called up by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the United Nations General Assembly held Saturday, which North Korea did not observe an "equivalent" response from the United States to the first disarmament operations of North Korea.
On the contrary, he stressed that the United States is continuing to impose sanctions to maintain high pressure.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are getting good results," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have this excellent report."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's just to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded field, we would have about 200 people right here in front," said Trump, indicating the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, non-governmental organizations were notified that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, the national emergency was not declared, an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it is a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built at the tsunamis in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other costs.
The apparent lack of an alarm siren for tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm was given, has probably contributed to the loss of human life.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the earthquake victims is heading towards Palu, but they will want us at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of Indonesia's brand infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign and turned money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected the administration of Joko while preparing for re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressure from persistent segregation in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands away from their homes because of clashes on the streets between Christian gangs and Muslims, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimental weapons.
Look: Daniel Sturridge del Liverpool pairs against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League against Chelsea at a point on Saturday's 89th, in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was about 25 metres from the Chelsea gate, with its team below for 1-0.
He hit the left ball before he pulled on the second ball.
The attempt went high above the door frame while turning to the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell to the back of Kepa Arrizabalaga by falling into the net.
"I was just trying to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrive and I gave a touch and I didn't think too much and I pulled it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at the 25th minute marked by the star of Belgium Eden Hazard.
The Blue Center has passed by taco to Mateo Kovacic before skiing near the middle of the field and kicking in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick half-field ride.
So he took a beautiful walk that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended up on the second floor with a left goal beyond Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will meet Naples in the tour of the Champions League at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will have to face the videoton at UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia goes to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia reached 832, the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters declared on Sunday morning.
A number of people were reported interpolated between the masonry of the collapsed buildings following the magnitude earthquake 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and generated high waves up to 6 meters, reported the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been destroyed from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is beaten to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in the morning with gun wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police have invited people who may have seen or heard anything in the area to contact.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just at the beginning, but I would like to make an appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street at Birkenhead who had seen or heard something suspicious and invited them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, in particular to the taxi drivers, who might have registered something on Dashcam, so that you can contact us so that they can have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman came to the scene of the crime to ask questions about the place of birth this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have stated that they are currently informing the victims' families.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He ran out of words when he found out what had happened.
The residents were informed that they would want us hours before they were allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a scene of crime.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the border area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the limited area by checking the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about it is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating the registration of 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "historic writing"
His expulsion would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his pagan fanatics.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "fool" and a "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became a goal.
The iconoclasty during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the story of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
That this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents part of this fracture.
Its results as Lord's protector must be celebrated and remembered."
Killing a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in South-West China in the news broadcast by local media.
The man, identified only with the name "Yuan", was found dead with a cold artery, covered with blood close to a piglet in the market of Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject pigs into a herd on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
It is reported that he traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 May to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a great pig in the pighouse with blood on the mouse.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had removed the farmer, standing in the declaration.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and masculine," said the cousin identified with the name "Wu", as reported in Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or the cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking, while the police are collecting evidence on the scene of the crime.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating a refund for the death of the collector.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, causing a series of injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 300 kg pig incarcerated a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to kick the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can work as "catalizer."
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious... they don't want to do anything wrong.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
The beaches of the Rosa hurricane will bring strong extended rains in the south-west of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing power while moving on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and to the south-west coast of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa recorded 20 to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 ET Sunday and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a shackle on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the United States. While Rosa is approaching the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm, it will start to push a strong tropical humidity towards the north, in the south-western part of the United States.
Rosa will carry up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day of Monday.
So the tropical humidity in contact with the nearby shackling will create heavy and extensive precipitation in the south-west area in the next few days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain may cause dangerous sudden floods, spills of waste and possible free in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates reaching 2.5-7.5 cm per hour in some points, particularly in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the south-west, in particular on most of Arizona.
There may be sudden floods with rapid deterioration due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could make the canyons of the rivers full and the timers will bring wind to buffs and raise dust.
The nearby drought will cause strong local rains on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flow of debris and sliding loads.
This would be the region's first precipitation in the wet season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rains become more extensive at the end of Monday and at the beginning of Tuesday.
Heavy rains will come down on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong temperature oscillations on the United States while the Arctic cools down, but the tropicals will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature changes on short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in the Central USA will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm beginning of October is expected for most of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 oC from the Southern Plains to the north-east areas.
New York will be able to reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate high temperature probability above average for the Eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's audience
More than 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the successful deposit by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would happen in the '80s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with issuers interrupting regular programming for a turn of the last minute Friday: an agreement designed by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Commission that it was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had beaten her as a bride and tried to tear her apart during a party to the superiors.
Kavanaugh, during an inflammable deposit, said to be 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen followed the deposit on Friday.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is a hearing similar to that for a football playoff game or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, has guided all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million telescopes, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the Office of the moderate Republican issued a statement stating that it would have voted in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was taken back by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while he was insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a hearing of the Commission of Justice.
He stayed with his eyes down for several minutes while he was being refurbished and sent live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "He has power while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued the statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have had other things to say at the hearing of the committee.
All cable networks and broadcasters were sent live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present the name of Kavanaugh to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would have done so only with the certainty that the FBI would have analysed the charges against the candidate during the following week, as at the request of the minority democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have voted to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politicizing" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused of criticizing her programmes of leaving the European Union "political fact" with the future of Britain and reiterating national interest in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the prime minister on the first page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Agreement for Brexit, claiming that a proposal that Britain and the EU must collect their duties is "very ridiculous"
Wayde Sims murder: police arrests the suspect of the player's death of the LSU Dyteon Simpson
The police arrested a gun death suspect from Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, said Baton Rouge's police department.
The authorities have made public a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB TV station affiliated to the CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted that he accidentally shot Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The office of the legal doctor of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task-force for police fugitives from the state of Louisiana, the lab of police science, the South University police and the people of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the forces of the zone order for their commitment and the search for justice."
Yess was 20 years old.
The 198 cm attack grew in Baton Rouge, where the father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 points to match.
On Friday morning, LSU's coach Will Wade stated that the team was "slow" and "shocked" for Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at any time," Wade said.
Vulcan ash savings Mexico City
The ashes coming out of the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity was increased in the Crater and 183 gas emissions and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was controlling the various rubies and scissors.
Images on the social media have shown thin layers of ashes that cover the parabristy of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicals have seen an increase in the activity corresponding to the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a magnitude earthquake 7.1 hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists in the wake of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Saturday after protesting pro-independence met with the police's anti-subsommosis teams and thousands of people joined in demonstrations of opponents to remember the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on the secession.
A group of separatists masked by the anti-somb police targeted the police with eggs and threw powder paints, creating cloudy dust in the streets that usually disturb tourists.
There have been further collisions during the day with cops who have used manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independents who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" were confronted by the unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long life to Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for mild injuries received during the demonstrations.
The tension remains high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the government of Madrid but recognised by the Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the flu had been low, and the Catalans opposed to the secession had widely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police tried to stop with violent clashes the referendum that was taking place throughout the region.
Independent groups were held on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, was an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he had no more hope of the possibility that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I have seen my parents cry with joy for the opportunity to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having won a fundamental victory despite measures at the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have made it difficult to maintain the slowdown this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement who find themselves in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered the police support protest with his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison waiting for trial from the end of last year, announced that he will be candidate for the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the influx of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after the explosion of a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after having taken a car repeatedly to a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
It is also possible that the machine was hit with a whale at a certain point.
Menga's attack marks the victory of Livingstone 1-0 against the Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingstone has marked the victory
Livingston has already promoted the Rangers by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as head of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference while Gary Holt's team went to the second division with the Hibernate.
Gerrard's team thus remains without a victory out of the house in the Premiership this season and will have to face next Sunday the first in the Hearts class, from which they will be separated by 8 points.
On Thursday the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues its series of victories in the division, remaining battled for six games, with Coach Holt who still has to see a defeat since Kenny Miller replaced it last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against the few incisive guests
Holt's team should have been in favour well before the goal, with their immediacy that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson found out but pulled his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only walk out the door after being inserted to meet Craig Halkett's headshot on the other side of the door.
The guests agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could have put the visitors in trouble with square shoes.
And it was so that the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers have given up a punitive football and Livingstone has found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson have been able to pass to Menga, which could sign from the center of the area.
So far, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and porter Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos had engaged Kelly in a stopover.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by the foot of the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow porter he shot off another Livingstone game scheme.
Cross occurred in the Livingstone area and were continuously neutralized, while two demands of rigour, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's replacement and one by hand, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingstone - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional route.
Their style of play and collaborators have changed little since they returned to the top series, but it is necessary to give Holt a lot of credit for the way he managed to drive the team away from his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, in charge of a masterly organized defense, while Menga had difficulty with Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
However, the Rangers were little inspired.
Despite the excellent performance in some moments with Gerrard, in this case they have gone well below these standards.
The last pass is missing - only once they have been able to penetrate the opposing area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which are half classified.
Erdogan received with contrasting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skys Saturday (29 September) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, in order to distance relations between NATO allies.
Topics such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's access to the EU have been discussed.
Erdogan therefore went straight to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population group outside Turkey.
With security reasons, the police have motivated the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come near to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept it in the country.
The protests reflect the dissension caused by a visitor considered a hero by some German Turks and called a depot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies against a car
A cyclist died in the fight with a car in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection between Bestwod Street and Evelyn Street, a trafficked road in Deptford, in the south-eastern area of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the hit.
The incident occurred months after another cyclist died, invested by a road pirate in Childers Street, about a mile from where the incident happened on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses were diverted and car drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during an accident in the masculine prison, reported the prison office.
The trump is exploded at the male maximum security prison of Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST about Sunday and is still in progress.
Specialized "Torado" agents have been used to manage the riot, which involves eight prisoners and is confined to a prison hall.
Agents were treated on the spot for slight facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison department said: "The specially trained prison staff has been ordered to hold an incident currently under way at Long Lartin's prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer prison sentence."
The Long Lartin prison hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison manager had to receive hospital care following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, the anti-sommosis agents were called on to intervene in prison to realize a violent riot during which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
The Uragano Rosa threat Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (of which the areas affected by drought may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression hit Arizona, but it is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week when the last energy of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the south-west of the desert, creating risks of sudden floods.
The national weather service has already issued sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to the south and east Nevada, to south-west California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday in the evening with rain.
Phoenix's national weather service reported on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclists have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Center for Uragans provide precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with peaks isolated up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west area, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with peaks isolated up to 10 cm.
For foreign areas at the risk of sudden floods, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be positive because the south-west area is currently going through a period of drought.
Standing at the drought monitoring centre, little more than 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second maximum category," weather.com reported.
Initially, the path of the Rosa hurricane will be able to stand on the ground through the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained the hurricane force Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"There are precipitations between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-west area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with the condition of tropical depression, to then go through Arizona and south Utah in the afternoon of Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that may be caused by Rosa or her slums are intense precipitation in Baja California, in the north-west zone of Sonora and in the south-west desert area of the United States," the National Centre for Hurricanes reported.
It is expected that these rains can generate sudden, potentially fatal floods and torrents of debris in the deserts, as well as dams on the mountain plains.
Midsomer Norton's assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys at a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a sedentary was found with gun wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 BST about Saturday.
It was transferred to hospitals, where it remains in "stable" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reported Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who can have received what has happened with the phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh "has suffered for the evil and the wrath" of the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the tactics of the democratic party," Trump said during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has stated that Kavanaugh has "suffered for the captivity and anger" of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh filed a motion before the Congress on Thursday, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual violence against her children decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also filed a hearing defending the charge.
The President said Saturday that "the American people could observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most expert minds of the law of our time, a lawyer with uncountable precedents in the public service," he said in front of the supporters' crowd in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh by referring to the importance of republican affluence to the midterm elections.
"At five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I really do," he said.
"For this fight strictly for exceptional candidates."
Trump has stated that the Democrats are committed to "resisting and hindering."
The first substantive procedural vote of the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place not later than Friday, as the CNN has declared a senior assistant to the GOP.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquakes in Indonesia and tsunamis, and numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many devastated by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when a earthquake of great magnitude and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach at the crossroads, breaking through many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude earthquake 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunamis came out yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and were not running away immediately, thus becoming victims," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it dragged with itself cars, trunks, houses, hit anything on the ground farm," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people are walking on trees to escape the tsunami and are survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Agency for Disasters have shown numerous destroyed buildings and shops, fenced bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The sawmills continued to scuttle the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was perceived in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the heavy earthquake of Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during the second world war.
The city's geography, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have strengthened the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "estesi" and claimed that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels are collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the cracks of broken buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are scattered.
Nugroho has stated that the victims and the damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "have been completely paralysed, with no information" by Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This and already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday because it did not know that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities had said that the waves had arrived at the time the alarm had been launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you feel a man on a top floor of a building screaming excitedly to warn people of the tsunami coming on the road below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, evaporating buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted the communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief operations.
According to the authorities, the army has begun to send air cargo with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the fugitives still need food and other items of first necessity.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget for tsunami victims in Indonesia amounts to over 800.
It's terrible.
Although the World Vision staff of Dongala has managed to reach the city of Palu in good health, where the employees have been sheltered under the roofs of the roof of their office, during the journey they have encountered a devastating scene, Dosebah said.
"They told me they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even though the relief groups have started the difficult operation of the aid tools, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign aid operators with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian legislation states that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And this hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
The second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, friends and family of the dispersed still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that relieved the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was extracted from a discharge.
Sunday, the escorts released a woman who had been locked under the massacres for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the preparation of the Indonesian national umbrella team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the scattered umbrella pilots.
Other people involved in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandadi, were his students.
"As far as the parachute is concerned, I am carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel crash within the umbrella community, he had sent messages via WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, stopped with a single mark of grey cut instead of two blue marks.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a refurbishment of ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying a banknote in Newport on the Levee, a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a banquet in the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver another money, researcher Dennis McCarthy said in the communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "screwed off the shoulder of Brink's employee" and stole a purse with the money for delivery.
Some witnesses have identified several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, standing in the loop, but the police have not specified the number of people involved in the crime.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes its name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing its name in Ye.
When announcing Saturday the name change on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change took place before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
The program replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotive reasons", said the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and means 'you'" said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We are passed by Kanye, which means the only one, simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our captivity, of our confusion, of all.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
An ex-collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has also changed the name with or without stroke and letters.
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore not to use the army against the civilian population
The Mexican elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody rapture against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the left student movements were taking foot all over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by extending monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding for the IA
While China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds devoted to research in this field, says the investor and operator of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of various US government groups regarding the IA, even though there is generally no formal IA strategy in the USA.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: it aims to be country No. 1 in innovation IA by 2030.
"To double the budget in IA research would be a good start considering that all the other countries are far behind the United States and we need a new revolution in IA," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the chances that the next major success in the IA sector will be achieved in the USA, Lee told the CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editor's house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the main companies of IA in China, Face++.
In the '80s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an IA system that beat Otello's American player with the highest score and was subsequently directed at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled the previous U.S. government technological competitions like the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be able to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain funds from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking the leaders away in the academic field, they're the multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been using luminaires from universities to work on IA projects.
Lee said that the changes to immigration policy could help the US to stimulate its efforts in the field of IA.
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those who work in academic institutions, similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations distribute funds to US researchers, the poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve industrial partners and universities and the White House has announced the formation of a special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research on the IA.
In the meantime, the US order to establish a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has not registered activities for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change in the name of the country in the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its neighbours' name is a claim on its territory and has put the veto at Macedonia's entry to NATO and the EU.
The two governments have narrowed a June agreement based on the proposed new name, but the nationalists believe that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the people of Macedonia of the Slav majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote for the referendum and the boycotting campaign raised doubts about the possibility of affluence reaching the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with NATO and EU accession and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is the price to be paid so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the yoke of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young men of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to finalize it.
The change in name would require a majority of two thirds of the total.
The State Election Committee has stated that there have been no irregularity reports until 13:00.
However, the flu was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the registered voters expressed their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a capital elector, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the Macedonia referendum to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage and setting up the seats in front of the tents mounted by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter the high-end, not the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that accession to NATO would bring much needed investment in Macedonia, which recorded a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required influence.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of the interviewees planned to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said he would vote for yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, affluence must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the West-West government since it settled in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal by avoiding the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during the win for 2-0 from Manchester City Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero has made it extremely easy for his point marked at 65 minutes.
The Argentine attack has received a half-field passage at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before he got into the open field.
Aguero has thus found himself surrounded by four green spells.
He humiliated one defender before going beyond the border of Brighton.
So he took a walk to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the porter of Brighton Mathew Ryan with a right-hand shot in the network.
"Aguero's having trouble standing" told reporters the City coach, Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he was able to signal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who initially took advantage of Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal reached 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in depth in the Brighton field.
He sent a beautiful filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second ball.
The Sky Blues attack pulled the ball off the net just before it left the field.
The city will fight against the Hoppenheim in the Tour of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium of Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch against the Colorado Rockies on Sundays, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their title in first division.
"Even if we play without a goal, we can at least be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the maximum level this year.
And why should I never want to run?"
The Nationals still have to announce a first launcher on Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer be launched in such situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher in his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's launcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the influence of republics during the midterm elections.
"All we've done is put into practice in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really giving myself up for that I fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "Let's see this horrible group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, you can see corruption, wickedness.
They don't care who can hit, who have to stumble to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give them."
The democratics, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and hindering."
"And it has been possible to see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "damaged, bad, meschins and liars."
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, casting strong fish among the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, um no, I expect one - that was a bad language of the body - the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Don't tolerate people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of the Labour Parliament to whom it was announced that they were not welcome, and because everyone said what they were thinking.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received a similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticised me to express my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all the issues that Jeremy was in agreement with the previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For the most part of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday evening meetings were just that.
Today, however, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and polite" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has never been remembered.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable or less for party leadership.
All of this started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect an investment of trend on my part and that I would take positions that I would never have accepted, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it does not really matter what I say - they follow invesive insults on the social media who ask for my withdrawal, denouncing the policy of the centre and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am happier than other colleagues because the comments to me are of political nature.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexist or racist background insults every day but who are not allowed to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of the level of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with any motion of challenge or modification of the selection rules, the party restricts itself.
In the last two years, I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly, and everything would "be fine".
But it's not about doing this that I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, caused by the concern of the Thatcher government that had let my high school class literally fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it, as local or government minister.
I have never concealed my political opinions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unconcerned by my political positions and by the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage the family cores, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the head of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, who are members of the Labour Party or less: I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those I consider to be your best interests.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: a father beaten scale the classification
Two late attempts could have somehow shaken the final result, but there is no doubt that Air has deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent's Day Championship.
I'm now at the top of the class, the only team hit on ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their boldness, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still struggling, so I must be happy," the coach said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "It is necessary to recognize the merit of Ayr, they have made better use of our opportunities."
Grant Anderson's goal at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but I brought the Air to the advantage, but a yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was flogged by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot reached an unconverted goal.
Climo has increased the distance of the Air with a rigid advance, just in half time, to signal and therefore to convert a target from itself to bring the Air to 17-5 at the interval.
But Melrose began well the second time and goal of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruarid Knott, which was spread, and at the beginning, the Air is again scored in advantage thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The replacement captain of Air Blair Macpherson therefore received a yellow card and Melrose made the man pay in more with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow sign for a contrast with Climo without ball, from the touch of the rigor, MacPherson signaled a touch down behind the mischita in advance of the Air.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost from the start, after Rowe had picked up the football from David Armstrong's area and sent Flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the home team.
Star of Still Game looking for a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after discovering that he was appointed director of a company of restaurants licensed.
The 56-year-old actor covers Jack Jarvis's role in the BBC's popular show, which writes and plays together with the long-term partner Greg Hemhill.
The couple announced that the next nine series will also be the final of the show and it seems that Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
Standing on official reports, he is the Director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to issue statements, although a source of the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "successful business of the restaurant" of Glasgow."
'"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a break on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a general marine area covered with saritiums in La Paz.
Public buildings display a blue ocean flag.
The bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to recover it."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast and now hand in hand to Chile after a bloody conflict on the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to swallow the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the salt, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will guard the judgement of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Aia court welcomes the claim of Bolivia that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a break on the sea of competence of the State.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial fight for the elections next year - has a lot in dance with Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would not change much if it did.
The United Nations agency in the Netherlands has no power to assign the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice arrives just six months after the final proceedings indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And long to advance the Bolivian cause, the last four years could have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The belligerent rhetoric of Morale has remained any good intention of Chile, has suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations to some extent, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions as soon as possible.
The two countries did not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia to the Aia, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly urgent.
Monday, Bolivia will be able "to enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantage", he explained.
Calzadilla has also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political escalation.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not take place without confidence in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong I said that his nation will never carry out nuclear disarmament if it can't trust Washington before.
It spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to have faith in the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be intending to resume the permanent diplomatic negotiations after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
It is also explained that it is an "Illusion" that the continuation of the sanctions and opposition of the United States to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea in the ground.
Washington hesitates to issue the declaration without the first Pyongyang to carry out major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's intention to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The fashion parades of Paris present the most recent trend in huge carpets that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of blankets or completely block the rays of the sun, do not search further.
Valentine's and Thom Browne stylists have revealed on the passels a series of oversized crazies for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely little practical hats have angered Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their exciting creations to the passerby.
Valentine's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide edge similar to feathers that has submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included unjoiled corners, a stork hat and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have cut lips and look more like Hannibal Lecter's representation than high-cooking.
One creation resembled a complete dive with masks and glasses, while another looked like a broken ice cone.
And if you continue with the huge declaration of style, you're lucky.
The style observers predict that the huge berths could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive on "La Bomba", the straw hat with a large thesis more than a meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very little practical hat that invaded the social media has sent another huge creation in the passageway: a beach bag in large straw almost as the model in custom that brings it.
The bag in rafia burnt orange, refined with fringe in rafia and with a white leather handle was the strong piece of the Spring-Summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these big hats and beach bags to arrive in luxury shops next summer, because the stylist has got such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the request of oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this is continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results to the exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide their students and their parents with the best level of service.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further higher education, to their chosen career and place in the world as global citizens.
As a sector of education that is able to develop and adopt a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and demanding subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach the heart."
This is a powerful reminder of the fact that we cannot rely only on English if we want to create trust relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can observe that the languages are above the graduates, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages received maximum votes.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of the students received the maximum vote with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the maximum.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as basic skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a matter of choice, are considered at the same level of STEM materials (scientific, technological, technical and mathematical) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons for the difficulties faced by employees in covering jobs are attributable to 17% of cases with lack of language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more opportunities for work requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a life-long competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
In a survey of YouTube among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% was unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
The knowledge of more languages, in particular those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Various schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with the personal teacher specialized in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare the children and provide them with the necessary skills for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will perform his debut with the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-mier opening game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be set for how many minutes it will play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After the training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the program of the six pre-commissioned Lakers.
"At this point in my career, I don't need friendly parties to prepare me," he said.
The moment of meeting a West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the start tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia, at a meeting refrigeration.
This is the first meeting of the five scheduled for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation suspended for his choice to cover the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the next midterm elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress at the November elections.
To what time will Trump's start and how is it possible to follow him online?
The start of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow the start of Trump in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the services this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become the thesis due to allegations of sexual violence with an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a little push.
So President Trump's campaign has stated that these five meetings during the next week are intended to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held by the Senate and the House of Members," they are in Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so decisive for its programme that the president will travel in as many States as possible as we go into the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for the Wesbank Arena of Wheeling, the evening start could call supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the media coverage of Pittsburgh," they are at West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate to the Republican Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in charge of the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, in Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team demonstrates the courage to fight to keep the hopes alive until Sunday
After three sessions in a unique way, the quartets of the afternoon of Saturday might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The bike of the oscillating pen is a completely invented sport concept in which players firmly believe and never as in competition as these.
So where would the bike be now?
"They had an advantage of six points and now they're four, so I'd say we're keeping a bit of a bike," Jordan Spieth said while he was away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four points ahead with other 12 at stake.
Americans feel a little wind in favor, as Spielth has said, and they have a lot to hope for, not finally the shape of Spielth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each one has three points on four.
Speeth was pardoned by the tea to the green and is giving the example.
The goutal walnuts of celebration became stronger as the match continued, sinking a crucial putt to match the accounts to the four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt that made them win the 15-hole game was welcomed with a similar url, which tells you that he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to put it all up to you for your game," Spieth said.
It's all that each of these players can do now.
18 lips to make a point.
The only players with multiple points of Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four to four and cannot do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning's ninth hole.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and to the hot crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there would not be a more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to suggest a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both on different lips at the same time.
However, the talks of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very soon to reach Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball, when he was married to Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have stuck Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they have not even been able to recover far.
However, there's no one on Sunday to help you get out of your mouth.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to observe from close by way of interactions between couples, advice that they don't give and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have questioned.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 in the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage in the final day of Ryder Cup after the end of the fourball and foursome games on Saturday with an advantage of 10-6 on the United States.
The inspired couple made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score to Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to preserve Hazeltine's lost trophy two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning's four-balls, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has more resistance to the foursomes, winning two games, but they have failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 single Sunday games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European candidate to win four rounds while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the four openings in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked wonderfully to beat down a slaughtered Woods and American extraordinary Bryson Dechambeau with an even cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who was drawn for two Saturday matches, showed some genius awards but lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's fourballs, came back to the side of the partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2+1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world's rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results expected in a pleasant and ventilated day in south-west Paris.
The three-time great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two points Saturday.
They won a grinty 2+1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in the fourballs and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, losing both opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point departure, although as a holder, the Furyk team needs only one pair to defend the trophy.
After having been the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea utterly rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions was a challenge for the country in the United States, that in such circumstances it would be totally refused to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said on the occasion of the General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has adopted "significant measures of good will" during the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, decommissioning of the nuclear testing site and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any consistent response from the USA," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no security in our national security, and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri has re-used the lamentable notes concerning Washington's resistance to "in phase" denuclearization with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, its declaration was important because it has not rejected all unilateral denuclearization as already done by Pyongyang.
It referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US President in charge and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work towards the "denouclarization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first renounce his nuclear weapons.
Washington also objected to appeals to relieve the severe international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to "have a denuclearization" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive way and even oppose the "war-end declaration," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on the knees is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our challenge."
Ri did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the leader of the United States had announced to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
On the other hand, the Minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last 5 months and added: "If the counter-part of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But also, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year's United Nations General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target the territory of the United States with North Korea's missiles after "the president of evil" Trump had called Kim a "missional man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, which had threatened to "destruct North Korea completely" last year, praised Kim for his courage in undertaking the path of disarmament, but declared that it must still be done much and that the sanctions will remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, saying "if you want two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated on Thursday to the UN Security Council that: " Compliance with the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and final denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported the sanctions to control North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He was divided by Pyongyang in July claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea accused him of having submitted "a gangster request."
North Korea had committed itself during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States had adopted "conformity measures."
He stated that Kim had explained to him that the "conformity measures" he wanted were security guarantees to which Trump had committed himself to Singapore and actions towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all its students to sleep more in an attempt to contrast the growing male culture to study for nights full of caffeine.
A university student has found that university students number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he considers to be the first of this kind in the USA.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that had given rise to the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end a girl came from me and said, 'Why is this just said to me now, when I'm last year?'
He said that no one had ever said anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much," he told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performances as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffer from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course of one hour provides for a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students can select cups of coffee, tents, gynastic shoes and books to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of a evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how the long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, therefore encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice to smoke cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride linked to "white night to study", still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students bring the lack of sleep to be a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, marriage, anxiety, it has explained and should even serve to avoid getting fat, as the lack of sleep brings the brain in anedia mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after following one of his lessons last year in Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all graduates to follow a similar study programme before joining this competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set up a wake for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" issued by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send in tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to beat Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression from outside the house with the goal of Dolly Menga that relegated Steven Gerrard's disarray team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team was looking for the first victory out of the house from the 4-1th of February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team hit Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coach matches leaving his team at eight points from the leading leaders in the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga has signaled seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Rangers formation has never seemed able to mate.
As the Ranger now goes down to the sixth place, the Livingston goes up to the third, and only behind the Hibernian for the difference of goal.
And there might be further problems coming up for Rangers after the Calum Spence lookout was cured for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown out of the house.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, which quickly exceeded Air in the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that cut a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated its opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated by ball possession, but Livingstone has made better use of the balls at his disposal.
They could have signaled just after two minutes when Menga's filter passage in the first time sent Scott Pittman to the door of Allan McGregor, but the central camper missed the opportunity.
A football punishment in depth of Keaghan Jacobs has therefore found Captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow could only pull on the side of the second ball.
Rangers took control but seemed to have more hope than convinced in their game in a rigid area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had to see a hard time leaving the 15th after a fight with Steven Lawless, but Albert Steven Thomson ignored Colombian's demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice in the first time, but the former porter of the Ibrox Liam Kelly didn't let himself be worried about the blow of Lassana Coulibally's head and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingstone's opening goal at the 34th minute can be unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it only for his commitment.
Recently, Rangers failed to manage a football in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and the change had a almost immediate impact since the wing had infiltrated a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw herself from the door line to block it.
But Livingstone continued to drag visitors exactly in the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after the other.
Holt's team might have increased the distance in the final stages, but McGregor objected to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton submitted a last request of rigour after a crossing with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning lunch: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and the CONTEGGIO continues... the day the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger counter.
A solid point of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950's "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those incredible cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these earpieces you can really feel the effects of the atoms released from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "He's a little broken right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
So they can "see" a common protein with many types of tumors and are then re-animated
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient and their laboratory alteration so that they can "see" a common protein to many types of cancer called HER2, and therefore these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promots the growth of various types of tumors", including breast, ovaries, lungs and right-wing colon, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure to extract immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to beat tumor cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West launches in a pro-Trump diatrabe wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) after its appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was posted in the study during a Saturday night live score after a closed performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be candidate in 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a maha hat, he started a blow against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to whites so many times and they say to me, "How you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have gone from America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star surrounded Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission against the charges of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transmitted, the registration of the West Filipica has been charged to the social media by the comical Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock himself is trying to get around West with the publication.
Also, West complained to the public about having spent a bad time in the backstage because of its cover.
"They bluffed me in the backstage.
They told me, "Don't go out with that bloke in there."
They've bugged me!
And so they told me I'm a marginalist," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the dark place?" and said "I'd wear Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments have generated fish at least twice from the public and the members of the SNL cast seem to be embarrased, said Variety, with a person who told the newspaper: "On this study a mortal silence has been silenced."
West was invited as a substitute for the last minute of the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West unconcerned many with a performance of song I Love it, translated by Perrier bottle.
West received the support from the leader of the group of TPUSA conservatives, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for taking the test on MASSA."
But show conductor Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "what it is and this is just wonderful."
"But I have chosen NOT to reward someone (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I think is embraceing a vomitable ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
It's not about the first artist to change his name and he's following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friend rapper, Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion and, of course, the lost musical legend Prince, who had changed his name into a symbol and thus in the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for reception in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was admitted to a restaurant in Belfast east on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant will have to present at Belfast's price Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Service Office.
Spade Kit Harington's Throne Star attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as combatant Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Trono di Spade.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the male hero's stereotype, claiming that such on-screen soils often make the boys believe that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has gone wrong" and reflected on how to manage the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old Co-star of Trono di Spade, admitted to worry a lot about this problem.
'Personally I am very concerned at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we now observe?'
Kit believes that television may partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its extremely male characters.
He went on, "What's innate and what's taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes kids think they have to be in this particular way of being human?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the young.'
In the course of the interview he also admitted that he would not interpret any prequel or sequel of Trono di Spade once the series ended next summer, affirming that "have ended with battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will play the main role in the Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a rapist.
The actor has recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with the Sword Throne.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in Emmy's fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the possession of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are exposed to these diseases, according to sources of health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change in the past.
In some regions of China, HIV spread in the past as a result of infectious blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, however, the number of people exposed by HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual relations within these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that a member of the staff had hacked the data of the senators of the GOP, and spoke of "dangerous bugs" and "cospiration theory".
On Saturday, the U.S. Member complained to a member of his staff about the publication of personal information by three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles said that the statements were promoted by the opinionists and websites of the ' ultra-right wing'.
"Bugies, bugs and still explosive bugs" said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published would include home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online Thursday, released by an anonymous Campidoglio during a hearing of a commission of experts on sexual violence charges against the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news escape took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the post source was associated with the Waters office and issued information about a member of the Waters staff.
"This indicted charge is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal and security information has been put to the test as a result of these false and tendentious accusations, has not been in any way responsible for the escape of such information.
This indicted charge is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' claim quickly generated online criticisms from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Flescher.
"This lie is angry," Flescher wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't get angry.
It must not be provocative.
The defendant's reasons should not be questioned.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Enorme if confirmed," he tweeted.
In his statement, the Waters stated that his office has alerted "the competent authorities and the forces of order of these tendencies.
"Let's make the responsible people unmask," he continued "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all my staff members."
Review by Johnny English hits again - the spy parody with a Rowan Atkinson undersized
He became accustomed now to looking for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, started in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
Will the veiled autorony on how many ships we make will be the new opportunity for the nation's export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits has obtained his license to cassette things for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that is a comic creation developed for non-anglophone film fruit countries.
Of course it is the secret agent's shock that despite his strange claims of glamour he has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pizza of that kind that has contributed with a single note to the theme of Gloria's opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
This is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man who once Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, leaving the chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English to approach the helicopter by wearing a medieval armor and the elites are short-winding against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comicity as an ingredient.
The humour seems to be directed to children rather than adults and for me the crazy disadvantages of Johnny English are not as original and targeted as Atkinson's dumb movie gags when playing Mr. Bean.
The pressing of immutable news now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has been infiltrated into the British spy supersecret web network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with the discharge of the agent in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that causes the vase to stumble for a alleged and tortured prime minister, who is already suffering from a political impoquity: Emma Thompson does his best with this character like Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the copy.
Its intelligence consultants inform you that each active spy has been compromised and that it will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that the troublemaker Johnny English, who now works as a school principal in a chic establishment, but who also teaches in an official way about how to be a undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a school of Rock spying course.
English is rebuffed in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a girl's role in the high society in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little dirty.
So the Batman and Robin of the Disasters for His Majesty's Secret Services are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: left Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their hate of ridiculous adventures: transformed by cameramen, they light the fire in a French restaurant; they fire the hell by secretly entering the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a mask of virtual reality to take a mesmerity with inside Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but because of the garb and exuberant, there is a lot of TV for children throughout history.
Everything's modest enough.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry couldn't assign Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be drawing up a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, although paid for five.
The party would like the major companies to transfer the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with plans to attract the country to the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day day was reduced by the union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, the announcement of a review of the political line is expected."
"There will not be one day to another, but a four-day working week is an in-line aspiration with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as with its industrial strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the general election campaign of 2017.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is currently not the subject of discussion."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the Labourist Conference last week to detail his own vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "no-faced directors" and "speculators" in public services companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies may not recover their entire shareholding package, since the laborist government could implement the "deductions" on the basis of the conduct considered illegal.
It also confirmed the plans to include employees in corporate management councils and to create inclusive participation funds, so as to transfer 10 per cent of the net assets of private sector enterprises to employees, which end up in the annual dividend pocket up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has referred the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court at least one week, and raises the question whether the findings of the government agency may influence or at least some of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will take place on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible for the FBI to bring something to light to them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said it while I was in the audience, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that he had come out of that charge, I said, 'Have you done it?'
It has been resolved, determined, unmistakable."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you named couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything in change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the exhibition of a remarkable cart of stars and has a equally predictable mission: to end poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people turning to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performance such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also a awareness of the real purpose of the event, which will end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you weren't willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way that would help raise awareness about their purpose of eliminating poverty.
But, precisely, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that they are 12 years old to reach the intended goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way of convincing people to ask for an appeal for action, or is it just another example of so-called "clickivism"- people who feel to make a real difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, employed for a number of different purposes.
It states that these actions have contributed to urging world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion to influence the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early years of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and advertisements from their actions, of which at least $10 billion were already disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that so far the capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom, committed to "helping children to grow as much as their potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and the Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition become a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been implemented calling on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, who asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we will frame and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of those who will show up at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a block" and prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, has revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as mentioned by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern fulcrum of Europe," he would say.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means of dealing with you.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a ship block, in order to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the consumer Energy Alliance's concerted event, a non-profit organization that self-defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take financial action and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "low-versative", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to strengthen the export of its natural liquid gases in Europe, and to replace Russia, an option that is absolutely the most economical for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the same President of the United States Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2, a project of "inappropriate" gas pipeline that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the North Stream 2, spent at $11 billion, designed to double the capacity of the existing up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project of nature.
The Cremlin objected that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was guided simply by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting held in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States.
The position of the United States has sparked the negative reaction of Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States to stay out of the European Union's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a major problem the fact that a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "serious consideration" to run for the Presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that he would take "serious consideration" of his candidacy following the mid-term elections.
In the course of a city assembly in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed the possibility of a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our bad government in place, and that means having a woman at the top," The Hill reported.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my candidacy as president."
During the city assembly, Warren said his story about President Donald Trump, saying he was " bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, by whom he was appointed to the Supreme Court.
On Friday Warren wrote in a tweet: "It is natural that we need an FBI survey before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's own electors do not believe that it should run in 2020.
58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not compete, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported such an application.
The survey has generated greater support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in support of a potential candidacy and 48 per cent in contrast.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in terms of a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would take an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after being rolled up in September
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What is happening to my son, what is happening after he has returned, I can relate it to other families that experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," said the public to a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "turn a little different, tired, wondering if there is that respect for which their soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have dedicated themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of firearms under narcotics, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the Columbia District support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen States and the Columbia District support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to refugees from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and the Columbia District presented a friendly and caring memory in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker who challenged this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He stated that his partner "and his violent children members of the gang" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She was put on standby in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations that face devastating problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy came back with a decision taken by the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2014 to submit a request for asylum to immigrants who are free of domestic violence.
On Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, stated that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all requests for asylum be brought to trial on the basis of each and particular circumstances of the request, and a similar prohibition violates that principle," states the memory friendus curiae.
In the memory, prosecutors have also objected that the policy banning the entry of immigrants damages the economy of the United States, affirming the clear probability that these become entrepreneurs and "provides the necessary work".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to guarantee asylum for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum is accessible to those leaving the country of origin because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or for political opinion," Sessions said on June 11, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
The asylum has never been designed to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people have to face every day around the world.
Experienced attempts to recover to Palu while the death budget doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said the mother of 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little feverish child in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At every moment there's an ambulance that brings bodies.
Clean water leaks."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, reversing among their cold personal effects, trying to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were injured.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, were victims of a back and back fracture, resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside because of the constant severe distress.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted the feeling given by the violent earthquake that shook the room that shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I've been crushed between the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife screaming to ask for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "making prepotents" with "advertising advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement on a U.S. daily, publishing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, a charge that China rejects.
The trump charge, regarding the fact that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, noted what US officials have referred to Reuters as a new phase of a Washington work escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalation trade war that has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese takeovers were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, great exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now increases those prepotentials by publishing advertising on our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the popular American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a payment ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"You will find few dissident voices on the street here in Beijing and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese people might have on China's economic road problem, as the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important daily signs has made the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspaper it was.
The Republicans are alienating the women's electorate before the half-sented elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Since many high-level republics defend Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court and are on its side in the face of various charges for sexual harassment, analysts have reported that a negative reaction will be seen, especially by women, during the future half-sentencing elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially demonstrated their wish to continue with a vote.
"These things cannot be withdrawn," he told The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published Saturday.
Reeher stated that the insistence of the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to place the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November," he said on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman for the MoveOn Progressive Group.
On Friday morning the protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Chamber, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars," he told the news site Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they were already tall; it is true.
But they could be higher, especially among the indecisive electors of the peripherals and young electors, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote but do not thank the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment charges against the candidate at the Supreme Court, the analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could have occurred if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP, it became a confusing set," said at the beginning of last week Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republic, according to NBC News.
"Not only is this the vote for the committee, the final one, or if Kavanaugh is to be put in the panchain, it is also the way the Republicans managed the situation and the way they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect the Democrats.
In any case, the Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to whom to believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the interviewees were sure or probably believed in the testimony of Ford, while 35 percent said they certainly believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other defendants, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate at the Supreme Court is marrying his genitals during a festival in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rewind with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that brings its origins from the open source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people may have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, of things to do, calendars, musical libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data storage is that it is completely available to the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff involved to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to give life to their decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team won't tell "Facebook and Google if or not introduce a complete change where their business models are completely discarded from one day to another.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to seek commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
After the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorated the ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The Church of England's only ecclesiastical to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was commemorated in its hometown after 100 years.
The Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, received recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a cop and never knew that he had reached the highest level of British military honour.
On Saturday in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren opened a memorial trail.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would have been opened exactly 100 years from his grandfather's award-winning profit.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion beyond the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a great fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
Then he rushed towards the line of fire and with the "largest gallantry" made the line move before he had raced with a single hand cannon and landed three of the distancing.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German checkman on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never be at the height and something that makes him weaker".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he was really honored to take a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by many people".
MMA fans are standing all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead Peppa Pig is caught.
Imagine, you stayed up all night looking at the famous Bellator 206 just to see you denied the main event.
The program by San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and had to be broadcast in the United Kingdom during the night, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some were based after being awake until the first hours of the morning specifically for fighting.
On Twitter a fan described the transition to cartoon animated for children as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The government's regulation provides that at six in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so it was necessary to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of the Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked for transmission.
"Pep the pig," "yes."
"The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think that when I think about the play, I think we can probably find a solution," said Coker.
"But there are six in the morning of Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you next time it won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we do normally - and we have tried to get so much for fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's a terrible situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "down" because of sexuality
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his own sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't noticed until he got to high school, because "not everyone is like me."
Speaking at the first point of Desert Island Radio 4 Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice hear about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also stated that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old-age program, Kirsty Young, took a number of months free of disease.
Presenting himself as a marginalist in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both the boys and the girls".
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and of feeling different, was the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed if they had discovered their sexuality by chance.
The two-time bronze medal at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and has used his own face in Australian Commonwealth Games this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice feel because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three times world champion said that being in love with a man - the US director Dustin Lance Black, who knew in 2013- "I was surprised".
Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When I was so young" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar high and low.
Both became parents in June, of a child called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "full perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that 'I had to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if he had already had the tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be from these parts to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley ran in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a house audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still makes him the skin of the eye.
Desert Island Disks is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside Mickelson shape put in a pankin in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will sign a Sunday record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to go back in shape to avoid becoming a miserable billion-dollar stone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a 12th time record, was staged by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between making a cheerleader and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what's bothering him.
Since he was never the strongest driver even at the edge of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the unconnected path regularly punishs the wrong hits.
And if the path itself wasn't quite discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday match, faced the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who collaborated with the novel Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the beginning of their 12 single matches, start with a balling start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not what he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a package on my back, put a arm around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furyk told me.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but that's the way it went and that's the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson Sunday will exceed Nick Faldo's record for most games played in Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never really reflected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 defeats and seven pairs, even though Furyk has said his presence has brought countless goods to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, argumentative, he likes to play people, and he's a great guy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that the younger players have had fun sitting against him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He's done a lot more than playing"
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the Captain of Europe, knows by experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a relapse.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 meeting in Valderrama where the team, captain of Sve Ballesteros, despite a five-point distance from the Americans, arrived at the line of the race with a minimum advantage, winning 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"I continue to repeat that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5-3 and yesterday for 10-6, at Le Golf National.
"That's why it's gonna be history to prove to me and to my team that's not finished.
You have to give the maximum tomorrow.
You have to go out there and do everything in the right way.
It's not over until the points are marked in the sink.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players of my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy for the way his guys raced in that hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have been overcome.
That tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performance, which is another thing.
It's nice to meet you there with a teammate when things go well, but when you're just your golfing skills are tested hard.
This is the message you need to convey to players: tomorrow, you need to get the best out of yourself.
Then you forget about your friend because he has to go there too and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will look for the best individual performance in his players more than teams, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have collected three points on four.
The same Furyk was found by both parties in those great meetings of the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing against the European "Miracolo di Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to go straight to the right foot as we did to Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game starts to take a certain fold, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
That is why we organize our consequence training and classify the boys in the way we think they are appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the contestant and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
The new German military ship has been recapitated
According to local media, the German Navy's latest fleet would have had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War times, but there will not be at least until next year due to faulty systems and an increase in costs.
The Rheinland-Pfalz commission, the admiral ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class, was posted until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper that cites a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying questions after delivery have tormented the destination of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Military Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles as well as some hidden technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact, it should be possible to use new cargoes up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delay implies that the innovative warships, which say they will allow Germany to project their superior power, will already become obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate Frigate Type F-125 reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little has been known about the reasons for the refund, but the German media have noted a number of critical "software and hardware flaws" that have made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
The deficiencies in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half the staff of the oldest Bremen ships.
In addition, it has emerged that the ship weighs too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tons, is twice the weight of the similar ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Apart from the defective hardware, even the cost of the whole project (including equipment training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems involved in the new freight became of particular importance in the light of recent alarms concerning the reduction of German ship power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy actually "has a shortage of ships capable of being used".
The official stated that the issue had worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships had not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spys on the secret life of the bats
New research carried out in a holding of the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing the way in which the pipelines use the view to search for food.
It is hoped that the findings can shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and superfluous pipelines, in addition to the brown earrings and Daubenton pipelines at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special registries will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the pipelines during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of the calls for pipes and the manner in which each species behaves.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, an NTS Nature Protection Consultant, hopes that the results can reveal what habitat areas are most important to the pipelines and how these are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to best maintain forests for pipelines and other related species.
The populace in Scotland and the United Kingdom decreased considerably in the last century.
The pipelines are at risk because of the construction and development works that are interested in trepoli and ruin the habitat.
The wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a threat, as can the muschicid paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
Pistachios aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to detect insects and obstacles on their path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the pipelines very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the vaults and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation has even set up the first reserve of Scotland to be used exclusively for pipelines in the province of Treve, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of pipelines in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
"That in Treve we have a vast area for the pipelines," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot on the pipes we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their need for growth."
It underlines the importance of controlling the pipelines before driving maintenance within the property as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single mother’s womb may kill up to 400 females and small ones, perhaps breaking through a whole local population.
Pistachios are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, disturb them or destroy their treasures.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don't know how their populations do it."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while the lawyers cause the German weekly
Christian Ronaldo has labeled the accusations of violence against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to advertise" with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to cause the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attack of Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also noted the charge of $375.000 on Friday to maintain silence on the incident.
In a video on Instagram directed to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, made statements like "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time Pallone d'Oro directed towards the camera.
"They want to advertise through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and it's all right," the dancer added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to bring charges to Der Spiegel, defined as "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the private sphere".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the footballer would ask for compensation for "moral damage to the extent corresponding to the severity of the breach of privacy, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights in recent years".
The event would have taken place in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the footballer's room, where he was subjected to analytic violence, as reported in the statements filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo would have fallen asleep after the accident saying that he was for "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also states that she was sent to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but that she subsequently agreed to a reconciliation agreement as she felt "terrorized by the returnees" and concerned about the prospect of "coming humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old is now trying to reverse the agreement, claiming to be still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the accident, and this summer he will join the Italian Youth with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will permanently compensate for the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "needs to compensate forever" for the loss of its world leader status in the construction of cars after Brexit, said the Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He also added to be "anxious" for the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC regarding the possible release of Britain from the EU without an agreement and the resulting temporary block of production in the factory of Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Minister Clark said.
The Japanese Automotive House argues that delays to the frontiers, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis factory, in which the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnston.
It adds concern to other British car manufacturers for leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, argues that after Brexit will close its Mini installations in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by the manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The production line of the Toyota is managed on the basis of the concept "just in time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for the cars in order.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, there could be dissatisfactions at the borders that would cause delays and lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day of inventory value in its establishment in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely thought to avoid these barriers at the borders".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today programme 4.
"The test, not only by Toyota but also by the other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a chain of great success."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop, but in the long term, it is announced that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates, says that the workers are deeply concerned: "On the basis of my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated."
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be sent back again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "refused for a week", while continuing the dispute on Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Russian interference with the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's councillors, and the possible obstacle to justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a comic book to record the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and voted to resign himself.
On the other hand, it was announced on Wednesday a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a overlap with the hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of inquiry by the FBI against Kavanaugh, further reversing the final vote of the Senate.
Sunday, Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It has not been established a date, it could be this week, I imagine it will be another week, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press."
Some journalists might challenge this statement: Sanders does not have a briefing with the press at the White House since 10 September.
Driver Chris Wallace asked for a reason.
Sanders said that the lack of briefing was not due to an advert to television journalists "who show themselves," although he said, "I don't sit down with the fact that they show themselves."
So he made me think that the direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
"The president has more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, adding without quoting the evidence: "We have checked the figures."
The briefings will be there again, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
The press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown the reason, making a free-wheel talk, and at the same time beautifying, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the Scottish NHS workers to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament Member Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK's entry into the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to addressing the costs of established status requests (satisfied status) for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "All summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit have been ongoing, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of an unagreed scenario.
I know that this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Members from all over the EU, and not just themselves, provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, giving benefits to the patients and communities to which we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie was operated urgently following a head wound
The Tennessee State Tigers defender, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after having reported a head injury in the Saturday match against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost for 31-27, as reported by Mike Organ of the daily The Tennesseen.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred just before the interval.
"He got close to the shipyard and he fainted," Reed said.
The first-aid workers and the medical staff have given Abercrombie oxygen to the field before putting it in a barrel and taking it away for further examinations.
A leading Tennessee State reported to Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no news about the type and the entity of the damage yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to understand when it was hurt.
Abercrombie, a student at the second year, is at her first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five games before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 games.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher ball taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher ball taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to the new labs' plans
The manoeuvre will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in the fine tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Ministry plans to collect up to 120 million sterlings a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher ball taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with the promise to provide more affordable accommodation and higher income.
The increase in the tax on cotton will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be supported by the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homeless people.
The surplus, which is added to the current ball tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the properties buy to lets (purchased for rent), could be more than 3%.
The Treasury Ministry expects the manoeuvre to be able to collect up to 120 million sterlings a year.
An estimated 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers to enter a first house in the real estate market.
Many of the country's richest areas, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time away from the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a cut on the ball tax to help the younger people with the purchase of the first house.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by attracting land without using them, and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up price-accessible housing quotas to arrange for British real estate dissatisfaction.
Mr Corbyn has announced an excellent series of proposals for the reform of the housing market, including the rental controls and the elimination of evictions.
He also wants to give the council more power over the construction of new properties.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said that I would be committed to restoring the British dream, which is that life should be better for the new generations.
This means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as it is for British workers.
For many people the dream of having a house has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland"
The technical director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "great ambition" is that of becoming Scotland's manager before or after.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted by the challenge of reconciling the North-East team, which is currently in the third place in League One, at three points from the summit.
It is brought to the Stadium of Light this summer after being the guide of St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership of the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a soccer player.
I was in series B and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC program Sportsound.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
Ross' predecessors at the Sunderland Guide were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician argues that he does not feel any anxiety in following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"The success for me at this moment is measured with the ability to bring the team back to Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs without doubt to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back."
Ross's career as manager dates back three years, after a period as assistant coach in Dumbarton and 15 months as replacement coach of the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to save himself from the retrocession to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the retrocession ring to the champion of the Championship, the next season.
Ross supports feeling much more comfortable now than during his career as a footballer in the teams Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the Alloa direction.
"I really believed that the role of manager was set for me, more than the role of player.
It seems strange because I worked well, I earned to live and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still face them in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems good.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do, I feel much calmer than I've ever been in my life."

The summer heat wave has led to increased inputs to the English pubs in difficulty and more concern for the restaurant services.
The data show that pub and bar have seen an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant revenue is lost of 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consulting company, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England in the world made it so that the month of July followed a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were over 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit more hard.
The 1.8 percent croll in the restaurant in June is worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which you drink were the most solid, with a homogenous increase above the drop in restaurants.
The pubs you eat also suffered the heat, although not too much like restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars the sales of drinks are 6.6 per cent a month, while food consumption is three per cent quiet."
Paul Newman, an analyst of RSM's recreational and reception sector, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factor when it comes to retailing.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly serious in addition to continuing costs pressures.
The long hot summer could not have reached a worse period for the restaurants and only time can tell if the most moderate temperatures, of which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary threshold."
The overall growth of sales between pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring company for pubs, bars and British restaurants brings together and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion sterlings, and is the industry reference company.
A child on five has a secret social network account that hides parents
A survey reveals that a child in five, some of only 11 years old, has secret social network accounts that hide to parents and teachers
A survey conducted on 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "fake on Instagram" pages
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual background content is being placed
20 percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
A child in five, some of only 11 years old, creates a social network account that keeps adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the Facebook account on Instagram, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news strengthened the fear that sexual background content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said to manage a "principal" account to show their parents, while maintaining a private account.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who urged others to "stupid me".
Research, the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of private schools, has shown that 40 percent of boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have allowed to hold private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many adolescents are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Elid Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of the light athletics, and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from their wide international experience in the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys a deep respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland the athletics could bring an enormous advantage to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I don't see the time to act as a voice of athletes and hope to be able to contribute and help drive sport in Scotland."
The American winner of 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medaglie, as well as the BBC's current opinionist, was unable to walk after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell me if I was taken back and to what extent.
It has been a long work, but I have taken everything back, learned to walk again, and today I am moving with agility!
I thank you for your encouraging messages!".
Advertising of a turtle compares mothers and pigs and divides the online opinion
A company producing a turtle has divided its opinion online with an advertisement that compares the mothers who eat and the pigs who come up with them.
To mark the launch of what is defined as "the world's first silent and unbearable turalate", the consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ad in the form of funny music videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new turalate.
Four true mothers dance in a cow's venile on a track that includes songs like: "Yes, I throw my milk but I don't have one thing" and "If I hadn't noticed it, these are not moms but my tits."
The choir continues: "Take it out, take it out, feed the children, take it out, take it out, take the milk to my lord."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy in the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated different reactions among the viewers, many of whom have argued that it highlighted the "roars" of the dairy industry.
"An unfortunate decision to use pigs to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their little ones are stolen to them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The turalate Elvie wears discreetly under a regiment for moms
Someone else commented: "I understandably traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to publish a mother's tuition that will continue to hold their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really a pointless advertising."
Others have defended him and a woman has even admitted to finding the "comfortant" song.
"I think it's a great idea.
If you're still breast-feeding, I'd like one.
When I used the trigger, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit insurmountable, but it doesn't get far from reality.
This is a great product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use the turalate (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like "bitch."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the domestic industry."
At the end of the video, the protagonists show that they danced with the discreet turalate infiltrated in the registrant.
The concept to which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the turtle feel like pigs.
The Elvie turtle, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be infiltrated in a breast-feeding regimen, giving women the freedom to move, holding the children in arms, and even leaving as they take the milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother commented: "The Elvie turtle is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use the turtle we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by showing in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new turtle is able to ensure".
This is not the first time the Elvie shooter has heard about it.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children presented herself on the stylist Marta Jakubowski walkway wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a tentopoli on the borders of Texas
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the rhetorical hardness and the political line of Trump administration have made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who trusted them were mostly illegal immigrants who now fear to reinstate the possibility of staying in the country by offering to perform such a gesture.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential trustees and other adult members of their families would have taken the digital prints and that the data would have been transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to hire children alone.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior penalties.
"Some 80% of the people who offer to hire children or belong to the families of these people are illegal in the country and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we are continuing to hunt these people," Albence said.
To try to process children faster, officials have introduced new rules so that some of them will have to appear in court within a month from the stand, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, as stated by those who work at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconference rather than in person, to perpetuate their case of legal status at an immigration court.
Those who will be considered unfit to receive aid will be promptly expelled.
The longer children remain in confidence, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempts to escape, as they say those who work at reception points and the reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position claim that the probability that this happens is even higher in a large structure such as that of Tornillo in which, due to its size, it is easier than the signs of children's discomfort are ignored.
They add that moving children into the tentacles without giving them the time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends could aggravate the trauma many are already facing.
Syria urges the U.S., French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war had already arrived at the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces occupy the Syrian soil illegally with the claim to combat terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without making any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011, more than 360,000 people and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and supporting the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the problem of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were favourable to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "incite intruded fears" that forced refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he reiterated.
"That should be just a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be granted in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations state that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of an Idlib coastal zone, the last major fortress of the rebels, has created the opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented an extensive attack by the Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that military action has the objective of the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front connected to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon a new committee of government and opposition members to extend a draft constitution for Syria after the war and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without interference.
Why Trump will be awarded second term
On the basis of this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators perhaps hope, his presidency should not conclude early because of a impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no flashing signals from the viewers.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first evening are more than doubled to 1.05 million on the CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC.
Fox News has on average 2.4 million viewers in the first evening, definitely increasing from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" program has exceeded the network percentages reaching 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted because it's not something to explain," says Neal Baer, a television showrunner of ABC "Designed Survivor" who tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
She asked him for a reason.
He said, "Why does he make me laugh?"
So chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, Washington's plot of each other can determine the future of Roe vs. Wade's judgment, if the families of immigrants can come together or less and the state of health of the global economy.
Stop following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow for the sixth time a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Paura", the $15,000 straw leather jacket by Paul Manafort ("a full suit of trouble") commented The Washington Post and the implications of the unpleasant descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, won't be able to look at Super Mario anymore without thinking.
"Part of why what makes a reality show seems to be the fact that every night there's novelty," says Brent Montgomery, the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", regarding the attendance of the actors and daily developments of Trump's show plot (in contrast with N.F.L. who praises Kim Jong-un).

This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the northern coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was closed at home looking at MSNBC and he was recording CNN.
He was unable to get off the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was dealing with the Senate's judicial committee and before the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we once did all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Influx of external money in the race for the most closed half-sented elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th district there is a cash flow due to the re-establishment of a congressional district that has made two members in charge now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of Pittsburgh's suburban district leads to the scene of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in charge, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redistributiond after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that in the old districts electoral colleges were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The 17th district race sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of measurement in the March special elections for the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
That place was occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump awarded the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given the democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. thought of penalising El Salvador because it supports China, then changed the idea
Diplomatics have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 a rather cordial meeting took place between Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the leader group of the Trump Organization to leave.
The State Department officials have decided to bring together the heads of US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan", said the spokesman of the Department Heather Nauert in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million from the Americans for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, would be of concern to the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and murderers.
After a number of internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in attempting to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, high-level officials made it clear that they were going to continue with the conference, thus definitely rejecting any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of reproof or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson from Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak anonymously of internal decisions.
How many have told it was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who nevertheless wanted to keep the anonymity.
Study history
In the report he will publish, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could charge Trump with an obstacle to justice, which now seems to be sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation aims to highlight the possible collapse of Trump with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to pass on to the Democrats, Trump should answer these charges before voters and perhaps a jury of its own while preparing for a new candidacy.
The unknown are many and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is not the case with his counterparts in Europe.
In both sides of the Atlantic we have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion we failed to avoid the opportunity to avoid the years of carnival that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of development where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans must deal with them differently at the moment.
What if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this paper reported that last year secretly suggested that Trump be subjected to interception, questioning his ability to cover the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news released on The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the FBI's new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the alleged allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, at the mid-term elections, will we vote for a Congress asking Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we'll do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to burn the candles of the Sabbath with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans dei Rangers is optimistic about meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after a convincing match against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them an excellent opportunity to qualify for the Group G of Europe League.
Although due to an accident at the knee, Central Campist Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season right on the occasion of the 2-2 match with Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the 30-year-old player.
"We faced the party convinced to do good and brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extresis, but, all in all, the pair is a good result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be able to fail.
Last year it was certainly difficult because of my accidents and changes at the club level itself, but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation is well done.
We can therefore forget the problems of the last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the long-term costs of assistance
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in the family.
About half of the nationwide interviewers said they had talked to their spouse about the long-term cost of assistance.
Only 10% claim to have spoken to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the insurance sector on the life of Nationwide, "people want him to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't face this conversation."
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determinant for the costs.
Involve a financial consultant: he may advise you on how to pay the costs you will have to face.
The choice of long-term assistance funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life-saving policy to cover these costs or to continue to pay for the insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
You appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can monitor your medical care and make sure that professionals satisfy your wishes if you were unable to communicate.
Also evaluate the possibility of a search for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions instead of you and make sure your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is being taken by emergency to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so you can always be ready.
"It's not just a financial issue, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
A man hit several times with an Ilfracombe compressed air rifle
A man was hit several times with a compressed air gun while he was walking on his feet after spending the evening outside.
The victim, a forty-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, in Devon, when it was hit by the chest, the abdomen and a hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He's not in danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a very strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The victim's budget is intended to go out.
The communications are interrupted and the relief officials have failed to have any information from the Donggala Regency, a zone north of Palu located near the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data about Palu and Dongala in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Centrale, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunamis, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The estate, an administrative region dependent on a province, had approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the province of Sulawesi Centrale and, above all, the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Another tsunami hit the west of Dongala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Sismian zone of the Pacific fire belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a very strong earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226,000 people, including half of Aceh.
2005: a series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the southern area of Java, the most popular island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that broke down against the southern coast killing almost 700 people.
2009: a magnitude 7.6 earthquake fell near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of Mentawai islands, along Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a slight earthquake hit the Pide Jaya reggenza in Aceh causing destruction and panic among people who remembered the destruction of the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
In this case, there were no tsunamis but more than 100 people died under the massacres.
2018: a strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of aggression.
Based on a signal issued Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he pulled their phone off.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility center and its security was set at $500, based on what KTUU reported.
According to the television network, he appeared on Saturday's trial and declared himself "unsafely innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-degree crimes, namely detention for up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also assigned a second-degree crime punishable with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin is accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to signal the alleged aggression.
The case is currently under consideration by the court Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of obstructing the complaint of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist on her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by groups of veterans in 2016 for having linked the violent behavior of the child to post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of the period in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity network and communications network are not working and the victim's budget is intended to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck off Sulawesi Centrale, located to the north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand extraordinary capital punishment for suspects of terrorist attacks in NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York ask for the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare punishment that has never been committed since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a home Depot rental van to ride on a cyclable track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
On the basis of the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the sentence of death, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and also "intendedly" affected serious bodily injuries.
According to the court's document, both of these charges may lead to a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued charges against Saipov to 22 prosecution officers including eight counts of murder with criminal association, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and car destruction.
The attack called for "a real planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said describing the way in which Saipov brought it to an end as "atrocious, cruel and depressed".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the South District of New York persecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man mentioned in the trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was finally sentenced to ergastolo in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and incriminating for having passed information to the Soviet Union during the Fredda War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg spouses both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say that in front of the investigators, they said they were proud of what they did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching a video of the ISIS on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As far as the 22 chiefs are concerned, they have been declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said "evidently disappointed" by the charge's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept a confession of guilt and the condemnation of the ergastol without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's group of defenders had previously begged the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory states that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of Parliament of Theresa May's party suggested that he should deal with the negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians must " feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May must face in order to try to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party have been underlined by the Torys who have participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The prime minister is trying to implement the Chequers Plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between what May proposes and the 'caos'.
At the beginning of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"We'll be out of Europe by now," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan."
Explaining the reasons for its opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be served.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the views that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed the idea and want to stay in Europe is completely false."
Parliamentarian Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also participated in the court and told reporters: "I simply tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public in general, the opposition will not vote on it and will not enjoy the favor of our party and our activists who turn on the trails of votes to allow us to be elected.
Let's lose the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May, he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
At the beginning, Farage said that politicians should be able to " feel pressure" if they intended to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message for the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to make us feel pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that has voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched along the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour start in the city centre.
A number of activists have pushed the Tory against Brexit's flags after the group was formed this weekend.
The lab was sent to the conservatives for security problems they had with an app from the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus agreement, for wireless borders and for trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking about running for the presidency.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said that after the November elections, he would think seriously if he could run for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the democratic senator of the Massachusetts Saturday spoke of his future during a city assembly in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often criticizing President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the November election against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The assumption that Trump could challenge in 2020 was in the air for a long time.
The event on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled in.
One participant asked if he was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to set up the government, and that means that a woman takes the highest charge".
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims players
Baton Rouge's police in Louisiana found out Saturday that they arrested a suspect for the murder of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday, he broadcasted a video of the murder asking for help in identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Yes, 20 years old, he was hit and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims brought a gunshot wound to the head that killed him," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.

Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's orders
When on Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of his friend Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would have made the competition heavy.
From the pole, Bottas goes well leaving Hamilton to defend himself from the attacks of Vettel in the first two rounds.
Vettel stops first to the boxes leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the group's tail, moving that might be decisive.
Mercedes stops the next round in the tracks behind Vettel. However, Hamilton surprises him after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari pilot tries to prevent him from going inside by risking ending out after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen leaves the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
So lead the race for most of the race without stopping at the rubber exchange boxes and try to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning the fourth place.
At the end, however, you must stop the pit stop at the 44th round and in the remaining 8 rounds you can not increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, which reaches the fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and was really nice to let me go.
The team has done an exceptional job to win the first and second positions," said Hamilton.
A bad example of body language
On a Saturday basis, President Donald Trump called on Senator Diane Feinstein for his insistence on not disclosing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused of trying to rape the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a commission in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony made by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "mechanical, evil and lying".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, angry, bad, and lying" he said.
"When there are clear signs that the news is being disclosed and those responsible say "oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you revealed the news?
Remember your answer... have you revealed the contents of the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn't." He added imitating the senator.
The letter in which the Ford accused Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the indiscretion was withdrawn from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, but I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did it."
But his deception is not credible for the president, who during the beginning of Saturday night commented: "See, I say, this is only a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, who was accused of attempted sexual offence by three women, the president suggested that the democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power with any necessary means.
You see the messiness, the pitfalls. They don't care who hurt, those who have to go over to regain power and control," the president said, as reported by Mediaite.

The Giants immediately took advantage of two goals on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the parlour before Dwyer reported the Giants in favor.
Francois Bouchard signed the match for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe who came up to Belfast on Friday night and won the match with the Dundee for 2-1.

Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape to the earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be called on as a hero after being killed to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take them safely.
More than 800 people are dead and many are scattered because of a very strong earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Heavy chess continues to interest the area and many are intertwined among the maceries in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues were fled to save their lives, the twenty-first Antonius Gunavan Agung remained in his place in the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower of Palu, which was oscillatedly.
He wanted to make sure the Batik Air 6321 flight, which was on the track, was able to take off safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was gonna crash himself.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirat said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australian publisher ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's really sad news for us," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands and the national disaster control agency indicates that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The count of the dead is intended to increase because many bodies are still under the massacres and it has been impossible to reach many others," explains Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman.
Where high to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial vehicles are transporting aid and livelihoods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water leaks.
The mini-arkets are sacked everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told the CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its utmost to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the men of the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia was already struck by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people were killed.
Aerial Disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that there is a dispersion after the incident of the lagoon
The airline that fell in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after stating that all 47 people aboard between passengers and crew members were able to save themselves, now maintains that there is a dispersion.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing on the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels have allowed the other passengers and crew to be rescued after the accident while the aircraft was trying to land at the airport of the island of Chuuk.
According to official sources, on Friday, seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline states that six passengers have been returned to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable conditions.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The United States airline and the Navy argue that the plane is in the lagoon because it did not reach the track.
Some witnesses argue that the plane has crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived at a very low rate.
"Ed was really a fortune," Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants were made to panic and scream and that he was slightly hit on the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some marines who were working in the vicinity to set up a bridge have provided relief using a rubber to transport the people on the shore before the plane ingested in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in aircraft accidents on lines registered with PNG but none of them have involved Air Niguini.
Analyst rebuilds the night of the burned woman alive
On Saturday, the presentation of evidence of the charge in the new trial against a man accused of burning alive a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the United States Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell data to rebuild the movements of the twenty-nine accused Quinton Tellis and the ten-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had recovered the location data from several cells that showed that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with the Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with the Chambers during the period he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to court on Saturday and testified that that day wasn't in town.
When the public ministry asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming that that night was in Sanford's truck, he confirmed that he was "lieving because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said to know the Chambers for two weeks when she died.
On the other hand, cell data indicate that they only met for a week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of the Chambers, Tellis removed messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He canceled it from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge provides that the trial will be held later on the same day.
The High Breed: what is the conscious hip-hop?
A three hip-hop wants to challenge the negative view of the kind by inserting positive messages in their own right.
The High Breed Group in Bristol maintains that the hip-hop has been removed from its origins when spreading political messages and denouncing social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to the origins and make again a kind of conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as Fugees and Commons have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A New York father cites a couple in court to have fired her with a "racist" text
In New York, a father quoted a couple in court for discriminating her after receiving a wrong text in which the mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuse to be racist by comparing the request to a true "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new father, Giselle Maurice, arrived for his first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after being aware of the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "embarked" fired Ms. Maurice saying that she was not happy with their previous father, an African American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
She paid Ms. Maurice's day of work and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice quoted the couple in court and, for being fired, asked for a compensation for the beauty of $350 per day for the six full-time work months for which she was initially hired, even without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said on Friday at the Post adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the charge of racism by saying that Maurice's dismissal was the only thing to do because they were afraid they could not trust her after she was offended.
"My wife sent you a message in which she said something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco's husband at the Post.
"Would you trust your children to a person with whom you were escorted, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a true "extortion", Plasco said that the wife has only been born for two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't deal with a person like this.
It's not very kind behavior," the financial consultant added.
While the legal case is still under way, the court of public opinion has immediately denounced the spouses on social media by criticizing them for their behaviour and for the logic behind it.
A letter reveals that the editor of Paddington feared that readers would not appreciate a speech bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments the letter: "It's not easy to put in the hands of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success of Paddington."
Said that the father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a playwright, would not have responded well to the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bit "trouble" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a man quite quiet, not a supposed person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when he had a son reaching a goal: you're proud of it even if it's not worth yours.
I think he interpreted the success of Paddington in this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter who was dying.
At the landing, the daughter was rushed to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't do it," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then he called me to tell me that she would be dead in a few minutes and that I should say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medications that the doctors had given them to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowing down.
She died a little while ago and it was the end.
I had to sit down and wait knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was aggrieved by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other pagan passengers of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he says.
"For all the time I've done nothing but cry low.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Two women's painful tickets to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide commit themselves to prevent others from performing the same act.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked a bridge in Wales with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and was killed at 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," he says.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, tells me that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that he lit up every room he entered."
But before he died, he left the job because depression had brought him "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found him after he had taken his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there's someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost his 15-year-old friend Mark not long after his mother died.
"You never said you felt down or down," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas day touched the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking at them in the eyes."
He says that his death was an enormous trauma that they had to develop: "He has lascerated the family.
He made us pieces.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI has launched investigations
"I think that if we could do as he asked, with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee itself would "lost the peace" because of the block of the root supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to be indicted?
Their resolve is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left at the mid-term elections on 6 November. If the Republicans as planned will get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators by pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met Ashley's wife, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
He will vote in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 republics and 49 democratics.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes to the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to break the indugues and confirm them to the Supreme Court.
The number of political refugees in North Korea "decids" with Kim
A South Korean legislator states that the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un ascended to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting the data from the South Korean unification ministry, states that the refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 of 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter border control between North Korea and China and the highest rates of demand from those who make illegal exits of these people.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) strongly protected between the two Koreans.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them with force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the negotiations on denuclearisation that are in a state of affairs.
This after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticised the US sanctions for the lack of development since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed with unilateral disarmament at first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh as "sterical" and maintains that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The minority leader Nancy Pelosi defines the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "sisteric" and states that it is not characteristicly suitable to cover this task.
Pelosi expressed this opinion Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think that if a woman had behaved the same way, they would have defined her as a Jain," Pelosi said about the statement made Thursday by Kavanaugh before the Senate's judicial committee.
Apparently, Kavanaugh denied the charge of having sexually harassed Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the forefront of the emotion, so much to get almost to the rumbling and with the throat tight from the crying while he was talking about his family and the years at the upper school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats who had defined the charges against him as an "unscrupulous and coordinated defamatory campaign" organised by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has proved to be prevented against the democrats.
"I think he has been self-excluding himself from his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if he would try to put Kavanaugh in charge in the event that he was confirmed and if the Democrats had to reach the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think that if you do not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but not for the court that presides now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a democratic, she is concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions about his intentions to distort certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that "You cannot send a Greek person and go to the Supreme Court and claim that this decision is welcomed in a positive way".
And women must use it.
It's a right diatrabe, months and years of rage attacks from which it can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we drag," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, and you?"
And he continued, "He helped me very much a woman who was leading somewhere. He told me that she also wept when she was angry, but he developed a technique that when she was angry and started to cry he told the person she was talking to "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so I kept going.
I thought yours was a brilliant idea."
The tears are tolerated as a burst of anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of the most frequent memories that I have of a previous job in a male-prevalence office dates back to when I once put myself to cry for an access to anger. An older woman of mine, a glacial manager from whom I was always slightly terrified took me for the hill and dragged me along the stairs.
"Don't ever see a cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they got you in their fists."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his race to the presidentials.
In 1987, when a boat called Monkey Business was discovered, Hart's extracurricular report that you had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not have tried to run for the presidency herself.
"It wasn't really a well-balanced decision," he said to me about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and there was certainly no need for another.
Someone called it "Biancanev and the Seven Brothers."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced phase, Schroeder was late with the collection of funds and I swore he wouldn't have applied if he hadn't collected $2 million.
It was a lost cause in the beginning.
He found that some of the supporters who had given the men $1,000 to her would have given it only 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" she asked.
When he gave the speech to announce that he would not have launched an official campaign, he was so overcome by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported him, disappointment to the system that made it more difficult to find money and voters who represented and angry for the sexual discrimination he was a victim of) that he committed himself.
"He looked like he was in charge of a nervous cleavage," recalled the Schroeder thinking of the press's reaction.
"Someone could have thought that Kleinex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my stone.

How the US-China trade war could favor Beijing
The opening-up of the trade war between the United States and China has been fragile and, while the battle is all but concluded, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing over the long period.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by charging the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with the new duties on items for more than $200 billion (EUR 175 billion) of value, which means that taxes will be applied to half of Chinese goods.
Beijing has reacted every time with measures of the same type applying recent duties from five to ten percent of US$ 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the US hit and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon come back.
Because Washington would have to surrender to his demands, but publicly joining the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the US can have a positive impact on China over the long period by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the research centre Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supports the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by the more than seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation in the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees in the country that had to be left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their support.
According to the estimate of the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem has stated that the Syrian regime will accept voluntary assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any subordinate aid under conditions or on the part of those countries that have supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the Ryder Cup 2018 beating the US team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has regained the trophy when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points that were used to beat the United States.
The US champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tea shot in the water at the sixteenth hole of the par 3 giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has been distinguished in all its tournaments becoming one of the four players ever to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first disputed in 1979.
The American Jordan Speeth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the rank Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, set up for 2+1 to English Ian Poulter who might have argued his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who fought eight, became the European player who won more in tournament history with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to have regained the cup.
It is a victory of the team and I am happy to have given my contribution," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his countryman John Ram who beat the American Tiger Woods golf legend with a score of 2+1 on Sundays.
"If I think I grew up looking at his meetings, I'm really proud to have beat Tiger Woods," said twenty-three Rahman.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the count of his meetings in Ryder Cup is 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 pairs.
A strange statistics if you think it's one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according to Jack Nicklus alone.
The U.S. team tried all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disillusioned performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning, we put pressure on the European team.
We threw away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All its 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I'm in love with these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We put it all on.
But they played better than us."
