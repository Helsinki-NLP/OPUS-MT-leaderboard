The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed the law on administrative responsibility for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in the conduct of procurement for public and municipal needs.
This law is designed to address the very acute problem of non-compliance with its obligations by contracting authorities in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Another two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive payment for already completed public and municipal contracts was widespread.
At that time, the President of Russia instructed the General Prosecutor ' s Office to take over the issue of special control.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to deal with non-reliable customers who had entered into unfunded contracts, they had tried to avoid payment obligations and had entered into illegal terms in contracts.
The problem was systemic in general in the country.
Since 2015, 9.7 thousand representations have been made by the Public Prosecutor's Office for the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs, with a view to the protection of the rights of the public administration, with a total of 4.5 thousand disciplinary officers, 533, and 75 documents have been submitted to the investigating authorities for the conduct of the trials, 46 of which have been criminalized.
As a result, more than 66 billion rubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
Since these huge amounts have been accumulated far from the result of the non-payment of the multibillion-dollar contracts.
A number of systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs have resulted in basic debts.
This is a typical case.
The manager of the small company won a social services competition for several million rubles.
Man has invested all his trading assets, has fully fulfilled his obligations, but has not received the money in time.
The result is a growing financial debt from wages, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek assistance in the prosecutor ' s office.
In a number of regions, the problem has now been tackled as much as possible.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt by public and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation amounted to approximately 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical values, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office is working under the manual anti-crisis management system.
The Attorney-General shall personally meet with representatives of the local authority, which shall be understood in substance by all public prosecutors of violations and measures to remove them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslav and Ekaterinburg this year.
Quality improvements in the payment discipline of public contractors will enable the implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ on changes to the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation in the establishment of administrative responsibility of the contracting authority for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in the implementation of procurement for public and municipal needs, which the President of Russia signed last week.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Development of Russia on the initiative of the Office of the General Public Prosecutor.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which provides for a fine of between 30,000 and 50,000 rubles for a violation by an official of the time and order of payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
And if the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is expected to be disqualified for a period of one year to two years.
All the prosecutors of the entities of the Russian Federation have already been entrusted with the application of these legislative novels in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group announced a warning to move to Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Coloring Population has published a warning for colouring people travelling to Missouri because of State discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The Group's statement reads: “Warning for the Traveling National Association to promote the progress of the colouring population, effective 28 August 2017, calls for African-American travelers, guests and citizens of the State of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise increased caution in travel by the State in connection with a number of suspicious incidents on a racist basis recently occurring throughout the state and brought here”.
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colouring Population, the Group had recently enacted a legislation in Missouri that made it more difficult for people to obtain discrimination claims and that state law enforcement authorities often chose minority objects.
“You people are being violated by human rights.
They are left on the roads because of the color of the skin, they are killed and killed," said the Kansas City Star newspaper Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colour People of Missouri.
“We hear complaints often, as never before.”
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the organization against the United States.
The Panel referred to incidents such as the reduction of black students on a racial basis at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished gas during his trip to the state, and the state police arrested him without charge.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Attorney General ' s Office of the State of Missouri that the probability of being on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for whites.
“The aim is to warn people about the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared in such a way as to take money for money or to inform their relatives that they are travelling in the territory of the State.”
According to the FBI's latest hate crimes reporting programme, over 100 hate crimes were registered in Missouri for 2015, making the state sixteen in the State for such violations.
The movement warning is also a response to the new state law of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to initiate a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) had announced warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after these states had adopted new immigration control laws, which had ordered local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which, in the opinion of ACLU, had to increase the number of racial checks.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recent public organizations have resorted to this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed as a result of a police patrol shot in Egypt
The unknown were shot by a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports with reference to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
At the time of the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed, three were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, police stopped the car and two armed men were then fired by firemen.
One of the criminals was arrested, the other was able to hide.
Rustourism supports the law on the removal of free baggage for non-return aircraft
The Head of Rusturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBK TV channel that "positive" refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of the free carriage of baggage on non-return aircraft.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person with no luggage can buy a ticket cheaply than a person with a luggage," he stressed (TASS quote).
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that, despite the fears of the citizens, there would be no need to pay for the carriage of the top-of-the-art clothes and mobile phones in the handcuffs.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and say that it's to the top of our clothes, to the zontics, to the mobile phone, to the iPad, or even to a computer that has no relationship," said Rusturism's head.
Former Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for airlines to rule off the free movement of baggage on return aircraft.
The point is that airlines can determine the number of seats and baggage included in the non-return tariff themselves.
Vladimir Putin commissioned to eliminate Baikal pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Baikal Protection Meeting reported that significant lakes have been contaminated in recent years.
He had been instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and implementation for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered a full recovery of the contaminated territories.
“Most of them have clean facilities,” quoted the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Russian Attorney General ' s Office should carry out an environmental inspection.
According to him, there were problems in the lake area related to the occurrence of natural discharges and a number of environmental violations by recreational organizers.
"I want to stress this: it is not always easy to verify, but also the measure needs to be known here, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and appropriate measures," he stressed.
In the past, the Genprocuratura reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of facilities under environmental supervision.
It is recalled that on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, during the direct line, stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special security regime.
The people of the island of Olhon, which is part of the Baikal Nature Territory, told him about the problems of management.
The Head of the Municipality of Sergei Donski has immediately proposed to address the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baykala water protection zone, but the Government of Burma has recalled that such a change is not sufficient, as restrictions are linked to a number of regulatory acts.
In Minéconomy, it had previously been proposed to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will appear in the south
In the village of Sosova, members of the community from the indigenous small peoples of the North Rachtinja, together with the inhabitants of the Berzev region, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of the saint Nikolai Cudovartz.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be well seen from far away, so it will be served for fishermen by way of the seams.
According to community representatives, the construction work will be completed this year, and the dome is now established, and there are church bells.
The Gamer REB of the fleet provided transportation.
The temple is named after the Holy Nicholas of the Miracle, since it is considered the Orthodox Church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In the Congo, the fishing industry gives the settlers jobs and feeds them.
Local residents are waiting when the temple opens its doors, and children are even writing about it in school statements as a matter of local courtesy.
Design with the death penalty.
Why do the laws apply in Singapore?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang, sitting in an open air breakfast.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, the circus accurately stores a box of iron attached to him from the office.
After the interview, the businessman is sent to the nearest hour - a hundred meters - and takes the bull out there.
The cost of garbage in the public place is $500, says Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflex since I was a kid, so you can't just throw a fant on a bridge, you know, right now.
And now it's all over the video camera.
And indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the center of the city are clean, like the museum.
Chang relates: Three months ago, his 18-year-old son was excavating the wall of an old colonial building.
The court recognized the man as guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to death.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He had ten strokes of wooden sticks on his cattle and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of body punishment.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly strict laws, the Aif observer was on the scene.
No one here is thinking about canceling the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Li Hong.
The Government has long failed to consider both the European Union and the United States in this regard.
If a person carries a large amount of drugs or trades them, he has been put in debt.
In 2002, a 22-year-old citizen of Australia was detained at Changi Airport, with 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister spoke in his defense, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
But the guy was hung anyway.
After that, our country's drug addicts are making a big move on the side.
The case is this: Singapore states that the laws are obliged to respect the CTU in an orderly manner, not only the poor and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are, a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a member of the European Union.
The variant in this case is one: if you get half of the cocaine, you'll be hung up.
When you're going to Singapore and you're meeting a bunch of warning dogs everywhere, you're just wondering how many bans there are in this city.
For example, the chewing gum is sold only in the pharmacy and can be bought strictly by a doctor.
The tourist will not take the whistle, but it's worth a cut in the subway, the fine will be charged at $1,000.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on my neck, "I'm fucked."
In addition to the fines, they are often sentenced to the "link in the courtyard": cleaning the parks and beaches on a Sunday.
$6,000. Pays a "criminal" who forgets to wash water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a small need in the elevator of the house, a special detector is being built, and the door is blocked and the signal is sent to the police.
Among all exotic laws are bans on the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public performance of songs, and even the excessive use of the room plant (!): it is considered that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid the fires, the smokers must not be loaded into the subway, otherwise they will be fined in five thousand Singaporei baccas.
In general, there's a thought: no matter how hard you try, you have to break something.
It's not like that, he's trying to convince me of Muhammad Kabir-Qajaria, the owner of the local tour agency.
In particular, fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years, I haven't seen anyone get involved in their violation.
Why are they staying?
So that the citizens don't relax.
The basic rules are closely followed.
For example, if a minor is sold in a cigarette cigarette, all will be punished in a chain: the shop owner will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will get hits with the "back" stick, and the seller will also be charged and put in prison.
It is because of the very strict laws of the offence in Singapore that are very rare.
Is that true?
As early as the 1970 ’ s, we had road chaos, car drivers ignored light lights, driven by their own desires, and were drunk.
After the fines were introduced, everything calmed down.
Now, the driver, drinking a lot of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the police will not let them go, they will charge a fine to the value of the apartment, and they will leave for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to be a variety of conglomerates.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore “Disneland with the death penalty” – a guest from the United States has led to the horror of the entire population’s wealth, the “fearing clean airport” and the “ocultural nature”.
The board, such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and they shouldn't be like that in principle.
The first days in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw a paper on the sidewalk, you'll agree if he gets into the subway with the frozen.
But then you're coming to the Small India area, and the other one is the pattern break: the bus stop is running plastic bottles.
"How's that?" You're surprised.
And that's how the Singaporeans smile.
It's all over.
Not for every such crime, but you should know that if they count you, you will not be punished, for you have violated the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a man to take care of himself.
Of course, Singapore's power is very authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam, I moved very carefully, and motorcyclists often come out of the hands of tourists, smartphones and cameras.
In the centre of Paris full of dirty bombs and petitions.
They don't try to put shit in the mouth on our streets either.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on earth, thanks to the collection of dragon fines and cruel (including the death penalty).
You're thinking.
Such a human nature: remember, and in Russia no one has stepped in for a role until they have become criminal.
Although Singapore is mainly not a fine, it is a voluntary law enforcement.
And we should think that in Russia people would also be happy with the clean streets, the lack of a garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who are crossing a public toilet elevator.
There's physical punishment, thank you, no need.
In the rest of Singapore's laws, at least there is a need to look at them.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trump targeted the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of the regime change is when it starts fighting statues.
The Americans do not understand it any worse than all the others - from here on the stage of Saddam Hussain's statue on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trump Government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic emphasis on the Status of Freedom during a heated dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acstan on the President's proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try on his own.
The officers of the owners of the sailing ships and artists representing the Statue of Freedom would want it if he tried to do so.
But he tried for her purpose, and especially for the meaning she was assigned in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the texts of Emma Lazarus were added to the Pentecost.
As Miller pointed out to Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history, but the Statue of Freedom is a symbol of American freedom, which is a symbol of peace.
The creation you are talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Status of Freedom."
Miller put the facts right, but as he said himself, it's really not about history.
This is about the current sound of the devastating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: "Your widows, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / Unhappily discards of your vast shores."
"unlucky discharges" have never been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature - he made it clear that these people are not waiting in America's Trump.
The issue of the meaning of the statue is part of the broader political and cultural war: it is indeed the issue of the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who fought to place her words on the statue after her death, were very well aware of what they were doing as a political act.
The sculpture was intended to form a link between the French and American republics by means of the banal classic figure of the Women ' s Picture of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her mind: the woman’s figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she's got a very different name: Mother of the Disappeared.
The combination of scripture and image was a brilliant feminist movement and a destructive attack on American nancialism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the ones who are entitled to change it back.
In 2010, the loud voice of Rash Limbo, his kind John the Baptist, brought about the coming of the Trump, argued that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neo-conservator carrying the fire of America in the darkness of peace: "Freedom is moving forward.
It carries a flag of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Fackel doesn't need to light the way to the U.S.."
I mean, against Limbo's habit, he really got in the way.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would have been tempted, unhappy, but full of hope for the people on board the ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
This literally means looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue is in response to the words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, it's not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
They do not need to light their way, but to burn up their hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Championship: Neil Blake commends Scottish members of the British Assembly.
Elid Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scottishs in Britain.
Neil Blake, the director of the Federation's games, said that a 16-person Scottish team member at the World Championship would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
The record number of Scottish light athletes was selected for the 2017 London Championship starting on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland “something special is born” and the Federation should take this into account by the light athletics of the United Kingdom.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and support them as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks that what they did should work.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: what they did has to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances were so different, but it's so brighter."
Some of the Scottish light athletes claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farach at 5,000 metres; and Elid Doyle has chosen her captain.
"Helid is modest.
Her Captain's speech was beautiful," Blake says.
"Many light athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and where they live or are trained, have left this room feeling proud and eager to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Elid had put into her were remarkable."
The owner of the Silver Medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which, on its fifth World Championship, will run 400 m away with obstacles, says that 16 Scottishs in the British assembly are “incredibly incredible”.
The previous record of the number of Scottishs on the world championship was equal to seven in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Mühr, who has been on the run for medium distances and who has had five British and two European records last year.
She's going to run 1500 and 5,000 feet.
Chris O'Her, who will take part in the 1500-m strike, is another Scottishman who is to be noted: behind him is a successful season, in which there was a victory in the battles of the British assembly and in the Annual Competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when besides her the only Scottish team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her fellow soldiers have not only entered the assembly, but in some cases they will claim medals and fight for the outcome.
"The captain of the assembly elects other members of the team, so in any case it was a great honor, but knowing that your friends voted for you and chose you, it's a very special thing for me," she added.
"Finally, I'm very proud of all the Scottish people who went into the assembly.
This shows how much we have accomplished.
And they're all the light-year-olds who're trying to get to the five-year-olds.
What about my Captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was okay.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were very happy to take the World Cup home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the sick and take advantage of what we're going to be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I've had another chance to go to his arena and participate in the competitions, and the atmosphere will just be remarkable."
Blocking criticisms on Facebook: do not go to public unless you are ready to hear criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood that this was a critical press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but this did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, made him angry.
But he did not shut his mouth to criticism.
Because, in 1783, Washington said, "It is possible to take away the freedom of speech and us, the deaf and the lame, will act as sheep for the battle."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
The Hogans have blocked and killed at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties has brought him to court for this.
The subordinate governors called this claim null and void, and the comments on the internet were written in a spirit of "well and what".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But that's also important.
And that's especially important when it comes to Hogan's guy.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the democratic favour of the state.
He was second in the country's 50 governors' approval ratings.
Hogan's not a stubborn reaction.
He demonstrated a firm hand in government and commitment to his principles.
It also uses Facebook as a primary means of communicating with its voters and with jokes demonstrates on its page its salmon after head chemotherapy.
Therefore, to block people who come to the governor's page, which is declared as an official public forum and conducted by government officials on taxpayers' money, is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with Washington Post, Press Secretary Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was simply their moderator.
But it's too easy to use the images of trolleys, spamers and heteres that abuse the Internet.
"Post" spoke to some of the real people who blocked Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls, teachers, businessmen, pastors who address their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible by appealing to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman of Bowi, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a strong comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the section of the commentary to the article "Post".
"I don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say it's a so-called strike, instead of admitting that they have a lot of dissatisfaction with a large group of citizens."
What subordinate governors call “concentrated spam attack”, others would probably call “an active life position”.
In the era of Facebook, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking criticism or making negative comments.
It's much less dusty work than it used to be when people were required to send, collect and burn newspapers with critical targets or to arrest and mouth protestors.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just in the numerator.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for refusing to listen to Facebook and other satellites.
President Trampu has been sued by Twitter users who have been imprisoned in his Twitter account.
One of the first, reverse decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to a U.S. district judge from Alexandria, James K. Cashheris, the chairman of the County Supervisory Board of Laudon violated the First Amendment by imprisoning the elector in his facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin made claims to the American Union for protecting civil liberties for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It's not that hard.
In Washington, D.C., the cost of mail was about the same as today’s Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly violated its authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous controls.
People under the nicknames "Uricola", "Valerius", "Belzarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters in newspapers that mocked Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected from the George Washington Online Project, his office was seized by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to keep them quiet.
Freedom of speech, inconsistency and speech is the very basis of our State.
And true leadership means agreement.
Ronan Rafferti is looking forward to the home facilities at the Renaissance Club
The former European champion, Ronan Rafferti, is looking forward to home comfort for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Latvia will host the twenty-fifth open-ended Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
The native of Northern Ireland, who was leading the Archerfield Links near the club, moved towards the final round last year until he lost Paul Ilsa, joined the new place and played the role of a tour representative on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi club.
“I have seen the Renaissance Club built, and we see how it is successful with this event,” said Rafferty.
“The players will see this field at its best moment, it is in a magnificent state.
Jerry's done a great job, fixing this place.
He's jealous of the commitment of this game and proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ills is looking forward to the first chance of standing up for the championship, despite the fact that he won his 32-year career in the European Tour and in the European Challenge Tour.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said a Southport player.
“I was unable to try to win Extremadura Open again, because it was removed from the calendar year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magic.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was truly a special time, and we will always remember him.”
Returns to the struggle in the home country of Gary Orr, who joined the European Tournament for the elderly after his 50th birthday this year.
This event will be the first public event in Scotland with the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always more important," said the resident of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a good golf course.
I'm happy with how everything's been going on."
The three will be joined by the former winner of Masters Ien Wusnum and the champion champions for the old sportsmen Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNally.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrence is two of the six Scottish people on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven Macalister, Bill Longmuier and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and the park is worth 5 pounds an hour if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds if two or more people are in the car.
All income goes to the British Prostat Cancer Fund.
British Roads to Overcome Harmful Emissions
Its own tunnels above the highways capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by cars are already being tested on the roads of Britain.
The country ' s transport agency reported that Autocar had reported the positive results of the 100-metre tunnel tests established on one of the sixes in the north of the country.
The 6-metre tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that are able to absorb harmful substances contained in car outlets.
However, the establishment of a network of such tunnels is only part of the vast measure that British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to tunnel networks, English are going to expand the charging station network for electric cars, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, increase the use of commercial transport on the electric train and modernize heavy-duty truck park.
According to official statistics, four of all air pollutants are transportable, and the unsatisfactory quality of air is the cause of up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud has changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaev.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of invalid Anton Mamayov, sentenced to four and a half years in prison for a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
That's what the TASS reports.
Earlier, the Prosecutor's Office asked the court to replace the term for parole by explaining its request that Mamaeva's disease "in the context of his detention ".
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with the execution of a sentence in the general regime for the defeat of which the ex-combatant was a victim.
On 19 July, a court at a meeting in SISO released a man from prison.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian “Golden Land”
Ready lunch, Bardina Degei doesn't use the dish.
She doesn't even use it in a bad way.
In his wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Pania, in the medieval Indonesian province of Papua, the housekeeper usually carries a sweet potato, which is called a note, directly in the eye.
After half an hour, the hummingbirds reach and eat with unscrupulous, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and this is where she is doing her homework, like a cloth cloth with water from a nearby shore.
The clothes serve the air in the room without a roof.
She was the youngest of four wives to her husband, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Multiplicity here is widespread.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are still soldiers.
"No one decides to walk through the village after five dinners," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life at the height of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which had joined Indonesia in 1969 after the questionable referendum, when only 1026 elders had to vote publicly before the occupying forces.
The existing movement of independence from the Netherlands quickly provoked its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintained strict control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as far away as abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour drive from Jaipur, the administrative center of the province, in Nabira, and then a five-hour drive to the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses covered with bamboo fences; the roofs of the oscillation have been decorated with rust in various red shades.
Few of the Indonesians came here, no longer talking about journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the popes worshipped a god named Uga Tamea.
There have been other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear this clothes,” says Degei, pointing to his bright, hundreds of hand turbans, a dark jug and a bright ruby.
“We used to wear only sheets.”
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28 per cent of its population living in poverty, while children's mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it's still Indonesian gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, located in Phoenix, Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Pania, a high province of about 153,000 people living in New Jersey.
Only in 2015 did Freeport acquire gold and media here for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can be welcomed by forest stocks, estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, bring one misfortune to the popes, guaranteeing that the powerful Indonesian armed forces remain here in a humiliating presence.
According to a New York Times survey in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local soldiers and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy by the popes threaten the existence of this gold house and are brutally suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 popes have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings by indigenous peoples in the high mountains of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Only last year did the Indonesian police arrest more than 3,900 peaceful protestors in the region.
“We are losing everything”, the report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Fair contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as punishments without a court, torture – especially frequent, as claimed in the other report, rape and defeat of the electric current – and the cruel suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because accidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harrisono, who is conducting studies in Indonesia for “Human Rights Watch”.
The Haitians have been delayed because Papua's resources have attracted the influx of displaced persons from other areas of Indonesia.
The 3.5 million population of the province is 83 per cent of Christians, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants come from the Indonesian island of Java, Sumatra and Sulavesi.
The Japanese lavender, the varungi, sells a burnt chicken and a mixture of the gado-gado fruit, supplied with the arachhis sauce.
Locals are trying to maintain competition.
“The migrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market for more than the indigenous population of Papua New Guinea,” explains Abet You, a 20-year-old native of Pania, moving to Jaapur, the administrative centre of the province, for work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – the mother of Papua (Women) – lost their market.”
The president of Indonesia, Joco Vidodo, known in the people as Jokovi, swore to address the inequality and violations of the rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former plot was supported by 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But there's almost nothing changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jackov, waiting for him to meet our hopes for a restoration of justice," Jou said.
In fact, only two months after the October Inauguration, Jacob Pania survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and sang Christmas hymns in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers were thrown out of the darkness on motorcycles.
Fearful children told them that they should put on the lamps.
According to local pastor Javed Tebai, one of the soldiers struck their tone and came back with four soldiers for a while.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who had been drunk, chased children, and were the examples of gunshots.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Amy, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned down the nearby government building of the electoral commission, and the situation worsened the next day.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritually hunters and filled the wind, a dance of the Pago tribe: they ran round and painted bird peacocks.
Some Protestants started turning stones into police and military bases.
When the situation got worse, internal radiosmen were ordered: “If the crowd is going to resist more than three times, shoot them” – as it was claimed in the official document that saw the correspondents of the TIME magazine, but which was not published in local media.
Fifty - six - year - old Jeremias Kayame, head of the Kego Koto area of Enarotali, felt a sense of danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to leave their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I came back, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told the magazine TIME, standing on the wing of his brightly decorated wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who's shot, but he says the bullet has flown from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there was a lot of shooting," he adds.
In the local village of Alfius Joua, he fell three times, as his twin brother, who witnessed the shooting, told him.
“I ran to him and looked at his body to make sure he was there,” said the magazine “Time” Johannes, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotge Mende, Chief Inspector of the Papuan Police, told reporters that his officers were only "protecting" their base because it was attacked.
"We must protect ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Commissioner Pujo Sulistio, police representative of Papua New Guinea in 2015.
“This is the question of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young Protestants were killed and much more injured.
News of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jacobi spoke in Jaapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and swearing to address the historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never be repeated again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said that he would set up an indeterminate organization to put an end to the historic human rights violations.
But we almost got the answers right away.
“Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them were among the nine or the early zeros.
The point is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed," he said.
Viranto then refused to speak with the magazine TIME on 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Rather, he said, ‘All things will be decided by a judgement.’
Viranto, who was accused of “crime against humanity” by the United Nations in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 Eastern Timorese blood vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including an incident in Panama.
The families of the victims from Pania have encountered such statements with a dark mistrust.
“In the last three years, I have been questioned four times, but there has been no change,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the soldiers will arrest me, I'm afraid they'll shoot me."
His brother James also expressed the view that the inhabitants of Pania were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by soldiers after he helped to bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the soldiers came after me," he says.
Shooting's not over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in a neighboring Deiyai district.
During the clash between the forest residents and the construction company manager, who refused to help take a man who was unconscious to a hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravenus Dow, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested against the construction site office of the company.
According to the police, the villagemen had thrown stones into officers who had responded to the warning shots.
But the locals claim that the mobile brigade (indonesian team) started shooting at the crowd and killed one man.
“We were in such a panic, we were afraid of revenge,” he reported to the twenty-nine-year-old Dominggo Badia, who lived near the hospital and saw how the wounded were being delivered quickly.
"I hid at home for two days."
Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called upon to respond and that the mobile police station be removed from the region.
Pania has always been a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is due to the dissatisfaction of the tribes of mine, monkeys, data and dams scattered throughout the territory covered by the greenery of the central high mountains of Papua.
Many have joined the Pope's Free Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the popes by resorting to radical attacks and infighting with kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of OPM come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Cogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and disproportionately detained by the military under the heading “Protection of national independence”.
Some didn't come back.
Among the people of Papua Pania is considered “a sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The small proportion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
The same kind of bread is not available.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly notes, as well as some fruits and leaves.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten of the club notes are made up of 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic gap between the indigenous popuas and the new migrants has increased, following the introduction of new aircraft at Nabira Airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually provided to more educated and sustainable migrants.
Popes rarely have the money or the skills needed to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's neither work nor money here," says John Gobai, president of the Pania National Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain harsh.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “adequate coherence with relevant organizations” despite having been granted rare video clips.
According to Felima China, Asia Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the pre-election campaign, to remove media restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now foreign journalists trying to keep reports from rival eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua face new dangers: refusal of visa and entry into the black list,” he said in a statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited by the direct neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States -- Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands -- requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diversity and widespread violations” in Papua New Guinea, including shooting in Panama.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The representative of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Armanata Nasir withdrew from the group statement, informing reporters in Jakarta that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide the evidence of episodes of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign Governments to focus on the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights Keiss Van Baaram, visited Jaipur on 4 May, locals violated the silence, saying, “We want freedom”, as the source also claimed to be present at the meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the popes say that they hardly vote again for Jokovi.
"Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he surrounds people involved in the shooting in Pania," said Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Pania, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in a pitiful state.
Gobai says that the people of Pania, like other popes, consider their vote to be a debt that must be paid to Jack.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Pania have carried out the last symbolic act of innocence: they have buried one of the victims on the ground directly against the police and the military.
Knowing that justice probably never prevails, at least they will not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," says James, not raising his head.
"What else did we have to do?"
A second fire covers the Dubian Neboskrabh “Fakel”
The fire covered one of the world's highest non-circumventions in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to quickly abandon a 70-year-old construction at 337 feet [337 m] high.
This is the second fire that has taken place on the high building, which is called Faquel, by coincidence, in two years.
The building had been evacuated, human victims were not reported, and no operational news had been received about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woken up from the fire alarm and screams of people.
We fled down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," Reuters reported to a non-scrupulous person named George.
According to the Dubai City Civil Defence Administration, fires were extinguished at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 a.m. on Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on the provision of asylum to victims.
The incident can return to the agenda the security issues of materials used in high-level buildings abroad around the world.
In an investigation by the Fakela Administration after the fire in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the poster – the external panels used to form and isolate.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the Grenfell Tower building posters in London could speed up the spread of the fire that took place there in June, resulting in the deaths of some 80 people.
The growth of the tourist stream in Ida Virumaa in June has been minimal
According to data received by the correspondent at the Rus.err.ee Portal in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 hotel services in the North East benefited from a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, with 125 people or 0.6 per cent higher than in the same period earlier.
The number of local tourists has decreased, and the number of foreigners has grown.
In June, the outflow increased by 7.3 per cent (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region increased by 8.9 per cent or 318 compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3885 guests from the RF stayed at Ida Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malahov gave the idea to worshipers who were guilty of his care
Andrei Malahov forced his worshipers in Instagram to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on any of the hearings, but today he has posted a fragment of the newspaper "Agnorance" on 1 August.
Photo by Malahov signed the "boss milkcoss."
An article on how to prevent and address the “outbreak” of the employee.
If you recall many reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who had begun to reform “Let them speak”, it becomes clear what he so clearly intended, writes “CP”.
It was reported that Andrei Malahov was currently on vacation and did not sign a statement of release from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal can be clarified in the coming days.
Five soldiers were killed in an explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the province of Gilmand in Afghanistan, reports the RIA News.
According to the police, an abandoned car was blown up by the military station at Girshk's train station earlier this evening.
It's about 20 dead.
On Friday morning in Girishke, a new CP occurred.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver shot a video of his shark camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal sealed on a video shark that tried his ex-camera GoPro.
Rólik posted on Facebook the US Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose staff is Scomal.
The incident occurred on 2 August at the Cape-Cod coasts in the north-east of the United States, detailing the Necn portal.
The man tried to remove the shark on the camera that he held on a special bat.
When a man noticed that the animal was more than three feet [3 m] long, he sank to it.
The shark tried to bite the camera, but it did not try to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the thief did so in order to determine whether the boyfriend was compatible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that the behavior of the marine animal was similar to that of scientists in the news.
A known cause of the mass battle in the Ural War Centre
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District to investigate the circumstances of the incident came to the Elan Training Centre, where a massive battle took place.
Some details of this plague have already become known.
According to Mash, on the "Vkontakte" page, the U.S. military contractors, number 31612, were brutally beaten for unscrupulous beds.
It all started with the fact that a line on behalf of Sayan had been demonstrably ignored by the officer ' s order to restore the vicar.
The officers were stationed on the side of the soldier in the sixth year.
Saina supported the first mouth.
At about 140 young men were smashed into a bed and a closet, and glass was taken out.
More than ten people suffered in the media.
In the CWC, the information on footing was rejected.
The study showed that at least one fifth of the passengers in the United States carry prohibited items in the aircraft.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of aircraft passengers were deliberately or accidentally carried into the baggage on board through the inspection points of the U.S. Transport Security Administration, including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft, without having any prohibited knives or other sharps.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and more than 1,000 people showed that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who recognized that they were consciously trying to fly with something that was forbidden to ATB, 19.7 per cent were millionaires compared to less than 15 per cent of the X-generation.
In spite of the ATB staff, food and water are the most common.
More than 3 per cent were recognized as having undergone a special examination of sharp objects, and 2.2 per cent of respondents and 3.7 per cent of respondents had acknowledged that they had deliberately carried prohibited medications into the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had been smuggled through an airport inspection and how well they had done it.
We expect the most - consciously or unconsciously - to turn the smuggler over to those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are rather complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what the ATB chooses are illegal liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could consider books prohibited.
Liquids are permitted on domestic voyages, but not on international voyages.
EPA Pruitt's head refuses to postpone the implementation of the Emission Reduction Regulations adopted by Obama
The next day, following the request of 15 States, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency annulled its decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama to reduce emissions of pollutants, air pollutants and power generation.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency now had more than in previous administrations than was required by the environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention a complaint against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The campaign was launched around 1 October, to which States were required to comply with the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid “incompatibilities to local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, which had long been known before President Trampo was appointed to his current position as Attorney-General of Oklahoma, was a consistent opponent of the strengthening of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms that opposed the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change in the course on the Wednesday was the regular legal defeat of the Pittsburgh course in return for the old rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the Head of EPA had exceeded its mandate in order to postpone the implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, following a sharp change in the rate of ozone standards, he was simply obliged to cooperate with the States in an integrated process of timely implementation of new standards.
“The previous EPA administrations often could not be placed within the deadlines, then waited for demands from groups of activists and others and discussed the deadlines during the settlement of the case”, Pruitt said, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous post.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial processes, and we are serious about the deadlines set.
We are also serious about our constitution and the authority that he gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that at some point the Pruitt may re-use his “powers to defer and other powers given by law” to ensure that the rules of “jcyjdfys” are clear and accessible.
The Republicans of Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, aims to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
The Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a complaint against EPA this week, said that the group was planning to continue legal pressure.
"The changes in the EPA course - following our demands - are an important victory in the fight against health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the power to cover their city," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Colombia.
The ground-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, oil and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in reaction to sunlight.
The triggering of this can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental protection defenders welcomed the sudden change in the Pruitt course.
"It's a shame to think about how much pressure it takes to achieve this perfectly logical step from a person to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump Administration and the protection of those who pollute the air and their special interests."
Congress IAAF extended the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the removal of the Universal Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Council for the Restoration of WFLA, which issued the report on Monday, in which it recommended the withdrawal.
For the extension of the removal, 166 people voted against 21 TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that WFLA had made significant progress in achieving the conditions established by the Council for the Restoration of Membership, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of WFLA at the London World Championship, Russian light athletes were forced to act under a neutral flag.
There were 19 persons admitted to the IAAF team.
WFLA was subject to an ongoing disqualification by IAAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) Dick Pounda was published, which mentioned numerous violations of the WADA regulation, which were permitted by Russian officials and sportsmen.
For more details on the last report of the IAAF Board, read "U" "IAAF has extended sanctions against WFLA".
Violent loss
As part of the 3rd Tour of the Russian Fonbeth-PflP team, the New-Mossian "Hymik" was taking a trip against the Kaluga FC.
Over 10 days ago, rivals played together in a Russian cube, but this time the game was completely different.
The chemical has nothing to do with the opponent, but the second relaxation on the base of the match has led to the insulting goal and fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the Colleagues with account 0:3 many had previously foretold an easy victory for the owners.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the New Yorkers had to be considered and acted against the defence, but against the position of the force.
In the 1st time, the kalujans were more organized and benefited from the control of the ball.
A very high-quality match was held by Alexie Sirotin, who had repeatedly experienced dangerous hits and assured his partners with his actions.
Regrettably, in the chemical attack, there was no effort and no connection to put the Kalugi defense in a dump and kill the first target on the way.
After the game was interrupted, the game began to take place in meeting courses.
The Novomoscians were more active in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team have become a misdemeanor in defence, which have allowed the Colossians to create a number of sharp moments.
In 10 minutes before the end of the meeting, the chemical took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experiences of the nuns have played their part - they have done their finals more literally and coldly, taking their time to take the doors.
After a dangerous attack, the Kimik took the ball to the corner, whose owner's field was turned into a gate without resistance.
The author of the naked became Yury Dubrovnik.
In the report meeting, Kimik showed a good game, but suffered a humiliating defeat.
Our team is looking forward to another tour - 11 August at 19 hours in Moscow at the "Torpedo" stadium of Edward Arrows will meet with the favorite "Centr" FK "Ararat", composed of Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmeilov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexie Rebko.
Come back to support "Chemick!"
The venue and time of the meeting of the journalists - 18.30 a.m. next to Magnolia (East, d.2, corp.
Chemical composition: Sirotin, Manochin (k), Romance, Shayunov, Homutov, Gogia (Oreskin), Dudati, Rizov, Svetov, Belanin (Adoevcev), Andreichenko (Ligin)

According to published phone calls, Trump pressed Mexico on the border wall payment
The Washington Post published a telephone conversation between the president of the United States of America by Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with Mexico President Enrique Peñay Njetoy Trump, he insisted that he stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The President of the United States complained that he was publicly speaking against the wall, and according to the information provided, he was told, “You cannot speak this press.”
Trump began his pre-election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Ternbull, also revealed a hot redundancy.
Trump told Ternbull that the agreement that the United States should accept refugees sent to Australia was “smiley”, “rejective” and “tupoe”, and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop moving refugees to the United States.
Trump finished the conversation, he said to Ternbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day.”
The bodies of the passengers who died in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to Russia, which is on board the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia the Russians, flew from Sochi in St. Petersburg in Moscow at 20:15.
At the end of the checkpoint, the board will meet with the staff of the ritual agency, as well as with the city mayors, and told reporters of the Deputy Minister of Courts and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba.
Former representatives of the Republic of Macedonia stated that all costs associated with the return of the body to Russia had been incurred by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Suhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the deceased in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhazia leadership had expressed its willingness to pay relatives who had been killed as a result of the bombings of travel and residence in the Republic, but the relatives had sent only confidence in the right to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, at around 16:20 in Moscow time, two explosions began to detonate large-caliber shells and other munitions in Primordsky Gudaut, at the warehouse of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic.
As a result, the storage space was heated, which caused uncontrollable explosions of missiles of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian citizens - Elena Polakova - were killed in 1970 and Elena Timofheeva in 1962, who were on vacation near a sero-indigenous source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhazia, were sent to the medical institutions of the Republic with various injuries.
Currently, there are seven people in the station, the rest of whom are written.
A study of the Russian influence on the American elections is a major juror
The Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Muller convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., to study Russia's influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, reports The Wall Street Journal and the Reuters Agency.
The majority of the jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The collected material will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to be charged.
Assembling a large jury, he gave Muller additional authority to collect witnesses.
One of these investigations by the jury, which started a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting with Russian lawyer Natalie Wesselnik, then another candidate in President Donald Trump.
To verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Muller himself promised.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump had expanded the status of his lawyers.
The Tramp-younger had previously said that he was expecting a compromise at the office of a candidate from the Hillary Clinton Demoparty, but no disclosing documents had been presented, and that was the outcome of the adoption.
At the beginning of August, a number of media reported that the report of the Youth Trump about the meeting with the Vesellenica was literally addressed to the elderly Trump.
In the White House, it was explained that the president had not dictated anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Deputy Mayor Pens were held in the workplace
The deputy head of Penz Irina Shirshin's administration was detained for 48 hours under the order of the Investigation Committee at its place of work, reports the RIA News.
Official reports from the law enforcement authorities have not yet been received, but the SSC press has assured them that they will soon follow up.
There's no comment on what's happening in Penz's marriage.
Irina Shirshina is one of five deputy heads of the Penz administration.
She has been the facilitator of urban affairs and land relations since April 2015.
Until then, she has worked for a long time as head of the Goszylsteksinspection of the Pensions.
Irina Shirshina has raised three minor children, and she has often become a mother a year ago, has given up her retirement and has returned to work.
Of course, there's no spacecraft or rockets in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the establishment of a bus by Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person in space.
Unlike the memories of the Soviet period, which are carried in some countries, the memories of Gagarin, on the other hand, are “walking on the planet”.
In 2012, the monument was established in Houston, U.S.A., near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a memory in the territory of the Royal Observatory was established in honour of the first 50 years of space flight.
There is a memory of Gagarin, Germany, in the town of Erfut, where our cosmonaut lived in 1963.
The monument to Karlovy Varah (Czech Republic) escaped a note in 1992 by public protests and was transferred from the city centre to the area before the local airport.
A 70-year-old Gagarin appeared in Riga as a memorial of Yuryus Gagarins.
So the name and the name of the first cosmonaut sounds more Latvian, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Mors Ford's murder: Activists lose Linch's courts on stage to call for justice
"Ford Mercuri" in 1948 passed past the viewers in Monroe, Georgia, and was horrified at the small bridge of Mores Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver drove to the bridge, a group of white men with roses crossed her path.
The main man in the middle of the suit in a thin coat was hanging his cigarette and looking through the windshield.
Sitting inside was scared.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" said the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The damp tires broke down the silence when a young black man was pushed out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which took place on 22 July, was just a stage.
But when Roger's neck was rubbed, almost all the viewers and they really were breathing.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Mors Ford Bridge to play again that night when two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey, were chained in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It is important that no one has been arrested for all these years - although we see them near us; though we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the order.
"It's five in our history and it's a rock in our souls."
71-year-old Brooks, a former member of the Georgia Congress, who has been fighting for human rights for the rest of his life.
For him, the spectacle was a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice had not been corrected.
"We want investigation, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he says.
"We cannot go to healing and reconciliation until justice is attained."
The coroner was found to be a simple body of one of the victims of the typhoon at Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to information received by the FBI, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of joining the chain.
But no one was charged.
While the decades are still open, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well known for two related reasons: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court's ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote for the premieres to be held that summer.
In the same election, according to the FBI, black user Roger Malcolm hit the dragon with the knife of Barnett Hester, a white landowner - apparently because of women.
Brooks says that, according to the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she had to be born was not of a husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946 Loy Harrison, the great white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and drove to the Mors Ford Bridge, a mob of lunatics surrounded the car.
“It is clear that he has organized and ordered the murder of Harrison,” this conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
"It is also obvious that there has been a dispute between state and city law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the murders but also destroyed the evidence and hid the witnesses' identity."
Brooks calls it a step.
"It was a temptation to election rights," he says.
They were all killed to send a black signal to the city. If you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has been running an annual show that has been playing the tapestry at the Mors Ford Bridge.
Its spectacle is observable, it captures the viewer, and it refers to the deep racism that many would like to consider is no longer in America.
It's hard to look at and even turn away, but Green thinks it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Linch's courts because they show us our own fertility," she says.
"But I can't make a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
This year’s show shows began in June, and on the first day of almost 30 actors -- a dozen whites, the other blacks -- gathered in the room and listened to the annual play review.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
For several years he had played the lead member of the clan, but he said that the role had not become easier.
"I think I'm freaked out because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at the time."
In the room of actress Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectacle begins with Malcolm, angry with Hester sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, Knives, get out of my house!"
He screams Rascon in response.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least, all black actors) are scattered by the hooves.
Green laughs at everyone.
"What is it?" Asks Ascona.
He's worried and upset.
Am I playing again?
"No," says Green through a laugh.
"I just don't think the whites used to say 'negga'."
"Yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to say 'R'."
Also, energy changes in the room: discomfort changes in the sense of society.
All must do the right thing, not only for the play, but also for the memory of the four killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Rascona says the word "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends in a harsh and fast way.
Screaming, shooting, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and plays a sad song by Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
In hundreds of yards, half of the viewers take tears and sweat out of their eyes.
Among the audiences is almost the same number of black and whites.
One couple came from Itaki, New York, to see the presentation; many live very close.
They were all almost eight hours suffering from Georgia’s heavy spirit while Brooks led them into the palace of Malcolm and Dorcy.
Until now, the murders have only remained history, but now that they're standing in the same place where people were being hunted, it seems that their ghosts are in the air right here.
When the last note of the song is silenced, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
Children are drawn to their heads, they are drawn to a bloodless beauty, and they're still bodies, and they're whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," is one little boy who's been fighting to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and the second thing is over.
The actors remove the ropes from their necks and remove the tears.
Bradshaw includes Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main doll.
Nick Rascona embraces two other actors, and he weeps, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the show finally fell on him.
"All right," whispers one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had a reason for this."
Later, the viewers are going to have dinner with the actors.
On one table, a white couple from Atlanta are livelyly discussing a show with a black couple they just met.
Denise Dapplinski is hard to find words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to hear these horrible, ugly words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the tapes are still going on," she adds, "it's just now called that the police are shooting."
In another corner of the room, Tyron Brooks was given general attention, which recalls his work as a human rights defender.
He said that he had already begun planning a presentation next year.
"The situation impresses us, because it not only describes not only the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their story and do not know their story are doomed to repeat it."
Court of Ostrafowal for Violations of the “Agitation Subsidiary”
The Moscow court fined Alexe Navalov for 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of the meeting.
The opposer was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20.2 of the RAF ' s " Re-infringement of the organization of the meeting " .
Former judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hizyr Mussakaev, concluded that the administrative case concerning Leonida Volkova, head of opposition chief Alexei Navalov, had been brought to justice under the same article as Navalov.
The wolves were found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
To this extent, Judge Musakaev assessed the distribution of the letters to the “agitation sub-station” that the supporters of the Navalowa held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
In view of the actuarial materials that followed the participants of the Saturday, the police thought that the organizers had deliberately concealed its true substance - public action (to which it was necessary to request prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Wolkov and his lawyers Ivan Jjanov and Aleksandr Pomuzev applied for an end to administrative production due to the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had allowed some gaps in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkova was not detained at the very “agitation Saturday” but had received an agenda that required him to appear at the police office to report on his active participation.
The same agendas were received by the Naval and another opponent -- Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordovia, a shooting bride and three wedding guests were arrested
The court in Mordov arrested a local man who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the Republican administration of the Investigation Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of 29 July.
During the crash, 42-year-old Saranska shot several times at the guests who came to the village for redemption.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been brought under article 213 CUF, article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105 CUF, paragraph 1 (a), and article 105 (e), paragraph 2, (a) (a) (a) and (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (a) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (c) (c)) (b) (b) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c)) (c) (c) (c)) (c) (c)) (c) (c) (c)) (c) (c) (c)) (c) (c)) (c) (c)) (c) (c) (c) (c))) (c) (c) (c))) (c) (c)) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c) (c)) (c))) (c) (c) (c)))) (b)))) (b) (c)))) (c) (c) (c) (c)) (c) (c) (c))) (c) (c) (c)))))) (c) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b))))) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b)))) (b))))) (b) (b)))) (b) (b) (b) (b) (b))) (b) (b))))))) (b))) ( (b) (b) (b) (b) (

Mining will strengthen the requirements of turbine suppliers for power stations
The Ministry of Energy of RF will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power stations.
At the start of gas turbines, gas turbines, gas pipelines, oil pipelines and oil supplies, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data from the Miner and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government decision has already been prepared and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only address “critically important energy equipment” provided to Russia.
Potential threats are identified in the document as information and access to the management of foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, non-profit partners and hackers.
The European Union has extended anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
The European Union Press Service stated on 4 August that the anti-Russian sanctions were extended due to the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines in Crimea.
This was reported earlier by the Week Arguments.
The EU Press Office stated that sanctions against the FF were extended due to a scandal involving Siemens production turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea in connection with sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe reviews all possible complaints and proposals by member countries for anthrosian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be taken by the end of the present day, and that decision had been taken, sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Person reduces 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to return business to life
On Friday, the British Educational Group of Person announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of early dividends by 72 per cent due to the start of a regular restructuring programme aimed at combating the problems faced by their businesses.
These reductions in jobs, which, according to the head of John Fellon, will largely occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to 4,000 jobs reduced by previous restructuring.
Person announced that he planned to reduce the cost of another $300 million ($394 million) in May during the third cost reduction programme to try to return to a business that had hit the fast transition to digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its share in the edition of the Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 per cent increase in commodity sales by the first half of the year to 2.5 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Private Nato was killed as a result of the deadly explosion
According to information from official sources, the death terrorist attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and translators were injured, as the NATO report says.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the accident in the city area of Karabakh.
This explosion was the last of Afghanistan's casualties this month: more than 30 people died on Tuesday as a result of an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, an explosion that took place on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a “carried-up individual explosive device”.
According to the report, all wounded are in stable condition and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern to NATO forces located near Bag.
The United Nations reported that in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and about 20 per cent of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, the suicide bomb on the car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area in Kabul.
The Taliban said they had made an attack.
On 31 May, as a result of a powerful explosion in the city centre, more than 150 people were killed — the most serious of human casualties in the country since the United States-led army removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the unsurpassed situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States, Donald Trump, assesses the need to increase the number of United States military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the attacks in Kabul during the past few weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its conduct, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Gani.
The Agency for the Protection of the Environment from Judicial Claims annuls the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The United States Environment Agency rejected the decision to postpone the Obama era law that states should limit emissions of air pollutants within the day after 15 states were brought to court because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environment Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “zone measurement 2015”, stressing that this step shows the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them,” said Scott Pruitt, Director of the Environment Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to delay ozone measurements, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to meet stricter air purity standards for one year before October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratically, together with the Federal District of Colombia, filed a complaint claiming that this intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trampa is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental protection orders introduced by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed at improving economic growth, according to Trampa.
But actions in this direction have raised the resistance of democracies and environmental organizations concerned about the potential impact of large emissions on public health.
The Agency for Environmental Protection stated that the use of ozone-containing air could “decreas the function of light and increase respiratory symptoms”, for example, asthma.
European Business Association Against New Anthrosian Sentences
The European Business Association expressed disagreement with US economic sanctions against the RF.
In the opinion of AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow business to be separated from politics and to find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and agreement.
Members ask the police to limit the movement on the coast in Pskova
The Pskov people ' s electorate referred to the head of the UMVD in the city of Sergei Surina on the problem of the move on the Great Sea.
The proud Members of Constantine Bolotin, Grigorio Partienkov and Valerie Lesnikov believe that motorists are preventing people from playing and resting in this place.
In their view, monitoring of drivers will help to make the territory more peaceful and secure.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the signs of the "walking road" and are free to wander on the coast.
It turns out that the capital repairs and well-being have been carried out.
Sports and children's playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
As the Pskov Information Agency notes, PPS and wives are patrolling the central coast at dinner.
They have reduced the number of passenger cars but do not stop moving completely.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to take out hard drives.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, suggested that the investigating authorities should not be allowed to remove servers and hard disks from business computers.
The Head of State stated that this was the case at a meeting on the investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary “to exclude the application for investigation of measures leading to the cessation of business activities, including the removal of hard disks from work computers and servers”.
Putin noted that, if investigators have such a need, they “will be able to remove copies, assure them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that “there should be no “conditions to prevent the continuation of the business until tax cannot be paid”.

British actor Robert Hardy's death
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the magic minister Cornelius Fadza in screening a series of novels about Harry Potter, died in the year 92.
That's what the Independent newspaper reported on Thursday.
His relatives told him about the death of the actor.
According to them, he lived “a great life with success in cinema, theater and television for 70 years of careers”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, he played with Laurence Olivier at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in the "Tragedy of Coriolan".
Hardy also recalled the repeated role played by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the screenplays of Agatha Christi on Ms. Marple.
He was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) prizes for the role of Churchill in the Bi-bi-si Teledrama "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981).
Robert Hardy also had to play the role of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something went wrong in the State of Denmark: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his veneer wife, Queen Margrete.
This year, we have a "golden" wedding, but on the couple's agenda, we're not preparing for the holidays, we're having a heated argument.
His Highness refused the title of the Prince of the Consort, and he tied it to the Queen, and he never regretted the title of the Queen of the Consort.
Henry lives in France, although he remains officially a queen's wife.
Mid-Russia called for Washington to stop Shelming Moscow
In the Middle East, the Russians responded to the statements of the Moscow-indicted mother, Pensa, in an attempt to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign political department a while ago.
In his commentary, MID pointed out that the United States was increasingly using cold-war stamps, inadequate contemporary reality.
In addition, the Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop the abuse of the RF.
As the Week Arguments have written before, US Vice President Mike Pens accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasili Lomakenko are meeting for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive individual
Vasili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who, according to all, are constantly moving to carry out the most exciting boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future for the first time in Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN's office rooms in Los Angeles, while Garcia, an uncertain champion in the lightweights of the World Boxing Council, did not go through the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, a World Boxing Organization champion in the second half.
Following the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former world champion in four Springs by Erien Broner on Saturday on the showtime channel, the two boxers are among five best boxers, regardless of the Springs.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck with you.
Lomakenko protects his belt together with Miguel Marriago on Saturday at seven o'clock dinner on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posted for the photo, manager Lomačenko Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive struggle between them would be the same.
"I used to be in the middle of the day," Garcia recalled.
"I've gone up to the Bronger category [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big anymore.
I'm poor for 140.
I want to go down to the lobby.
And he's gonna have to get up to $135, and then we're gonna set up a unit.
That's what the sick want.
Let's make this work for them."
Lomakenko agreed.
“The box needs this unit.”
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of a strategy that he maintained to carry out his first struggle in weight 135 later this year to appoint for the next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 nocauts), which was also interested in dealing with the winner of the single match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the World Cup in the lightweight Arena Forum on 23 September.
“Boy may be on the PPV because all the patients asked for it,” Garcia said, expressing his willingness to meet the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready...’
Garcia said that Lomačenko was considered a "shocking boxer" and perhaps would visit his Saturday unit.
But Lomačenko didn't get to thank Garcia right away, and he said he thought the three-weighted champion from Riversaid looked "a bit slow, sorry, Mikey... you were asking for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing the power of the impact, and then the box.
They both said that they felt the tension in front of their own individual.
“This fight must take place.
None of the other fights cause so much interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was expecting someone from the football boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
That will be a great struggle."
On several central streets, Moscow is moving to the exits
In these exits, on 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted to the capital at the Tver Street of Nassau Street to the Triumphal Square, as well as the 1st Tver-Jam Street.
In addition, the trip will be closed in Leningrad County, from the Third Transport Call to the 1st Tverk-Jam Street.
In all areas, the cover will operate on both sides, as reported by the Information Centre of the Department of Transport of Moscow.
The streets will be crossed from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August due to their well-being.
The exits will also be closed on the Moscow coast.
There continues to be a railway park.
Putin ordered the Genprocurator's Office to check the Bikel
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, commissioned the Office of the Prosecutor-General, F.F., to inspect the Baikal territory for the purposes of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Office of the Secretary-General to check the Baikal territory for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested action if the facts of the violations were identified.
New test results for the assessment of the age of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of asylum-seekers' tests in Sweden, which have undergone a new age assessment method, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested have been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Judicial Agency (Rätsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of age in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for not being able to determine the present age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 trials, and the Judicial Agency has now published the results of 2,481 trials between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were assessed as persons 18 years of age or older and, in another 25 cases, the judicial agency assessed that the tested “probably, persons 18 years of age or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, it was stated that the person “probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only when the age of a person is questioned.
According to Johan Garansson of the Judicial Medical Agency, the results were consistent with the results of the previous months.
“We don’t see a big difference with statistics over the past few months, numbers are quite appropriate,” he said to the The Local portal.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In my agency published the results of the 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “at the earliest, 18 years of age tested”.
However, after considering the 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person openly stated that he was 18 this year.
The method of medical evaluation of the age of X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and tomography of the knee systems and of their analysis to dentists and x-rayologists has also led to criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Karolin Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have been through sexual creation sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think I should use the methods of measurement that are being used right now.
The biological age is thus defined very incorrectly.
If we can't determine it with certainty, we don't have to do what we can," he said, "Metro."
However, Garancesen from the Judicial Medical Agency expressed himself in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is mistaken.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about 18, then he's about 10 percent."
I wonder if I'm going to be the president.
During his work trip to Buratiu Vladimir Putin, who was willing to consider whether he would be the President of Russia in the 2018 elections, the interface was passed on.
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Cheremuški in the Buryat region.
During the video conference on the elimination of the fire in Burma and the Irkutsk region, the interviewer addressed Putin with the words, "Vladimir Vladimirovic, we ask you: when the following presidential elections will be held, we all ask you to re-evaluate this position."
"Okay, I think, thank you," the president said in reply.
On 28 July, the Russian President's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the pre-election headquarters of Vladimir Putin would be headed by the head of the President's administration, F.F. Anton Wayne.
The sands referred to these assumptions as "nothing based on unwarranted, hypothetical arguments".
"There are no headquarters yet, until the establishment of the headquarters is far away, until the electoral campaign is far away," said Peskov.
"It's not on the agenda until now," said Peskov.
Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday at a meeting with President Tramp, which goes into another party.
"You like it or not, but the democracies have distanced themselves from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I speak to you with many prayers and many thoughts... today I tell you, people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you as a Governor-democratic."
The meeting burst with applause.
"That's why tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to a Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that it's time to play a different game."
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at the meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 per cent in West Virginia, and Justice did not support a candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, because he inherited coal business from his father.
It is estimated at $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement Thursday evening that “The return of Governor Justin to another party is another attack on the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere than it is working to make our country a big one again”.
“In view of the 15 governors and the control of the smallest number of state legislatures in history, the statement by Governor Justice is just another refusal from a party that does not have leaders on top of the bottom and is unable to find a positive, uniting message,” reported CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Ron McDonnell Republican Party.
Mr. Krasavčík's co-weighted cell phone found the house thanks to the shocks
The Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., set up a cat called Mr. Krasavčík with a weight of over 20 pounds [14 kg] after he became famous for the Internet.
That's what Mashable says.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on Facebook in the Pittsburgh account, asking to find its owner, because “he was obviously fed earlier.”
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's womb could become a new membrane.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand letters and 15,000 comments.
In comments, dozens of people have expressed a desire to welcome Mr. Krasavčík.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take over his weight.
In an interview with the WNCN radio, the American said that she had already had such experience: she took the cat home for about 10 pounds, and now it's worth more than five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to an Australian basket with unusually long paws.
The animal photo post collected more than 68,000 searches.
The commentators noted that she could make a career in the model business.
Who praised Russia ' s “screaming” apology for the doping scandal
The international athlete Sebastian Kou praised him for calling sincere excuses from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was now a bad time to allow the country to participate again in the sporting contests.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics Dmitry Schlachtin reported to the International Association of Light Athletics Federations Congress, which had passed the world's light athletic champion, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized “to all sportsmen who had stolen gold and silver medals at the competitions”.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations voted in favour of the withdrawal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) issued a report on the evidence of the State ' s application of the doping.
“I found that today’s response, today’s report was very sincere,” the president of the International Association of Light-Athletics Federations told reporters.
“All the Council and Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it was experiencing extreme heat of time and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the Federation.”
Kou said he was also “adjusted” that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the congress supports the recommendations of the Special Commission that it is not time to restore Russia to rights now," Kou said.
“For the next few months, we have to do everything we can to address this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean sportsmen from the enclosed system," he added.
Nine Russian athletes, which meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Light-Athletics Federations, will be under the neutral flag of the World's Light Athletics Championship, which will start in London on Friday.
The head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Light and Light and Air Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements still needed to be met to restore Russia.
As he told reporters in London after the report made on the Board of the International Association of Leco Athletic Federations, drug testing is still not being carried out in sufficient volume, and removed trainers are still quietly doing their work.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a hossimist
The detained Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) journalist Vasili Muravicki was arrested for two months, reports the SBU.
The Journal of Gitimir is suspected of public change by posting its publications on Russian websites and in violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
However, Russia does not support the actions of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a “barbar policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy agreed to a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship, Commander Borsini, entered the territorial waters of Libya to stop the flow of illegal migrants along with the WMI.
The decision to initiate the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which does not control most of the territory of the country.
The opposition office and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, gave his command to oppose the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Libyan office of Faiz Saradza, recognised by Europe.
The Italian authorities went to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on illegal immigrants from Libya were reported in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that the resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A major failure occurred in Skype
The global failure of the Skype service was recorded today in several countries of the world.
Users began making complaints to programme developers on Thursday, 3 August.
In Microsoft it was stressed that specialists are already working actively to address the problems faced by Europeans and North America, explains the RIA News.
Let me recall that in June of the year, Skype also failed.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
The two leaders of the Ukraine's Light Athletic Assembly have removed the participation in the PM
Olga Zemlak and Olese Povh, who are in the short run, are excluded from Ukraine's membership for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the Federation of Light Athletics (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by the sponsorship of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) for Light Athletics disciplinary proceedings.
From the Ukrainian delegation, Coach Sergey Basenko has also been excluded.
As reported by Sportarena, IAAF suspects sportsmen in the application of doping.
Povh is the bronze knight of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, Europe-2010 champion at 4 to 100 metres, the Earth winner of the 2012 European Championship at 4 to 400 metres.
The World's Easy Athletics Championship in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How financial rules affect the movement of Neimar to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing the unrestricted costs of European football clubs do not prevent a world-renowned Nimara transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to the French Pari Saint-German.
Whatever the consequences may be in the chain, for Pari St. Germany, by the WEFA, a leading body controlling European football, in which the teams are banned from participating in the prestigious competition “The League of Champions”.
According to the Financial Fair-platform Regulations introduced by WEFA in 2011, the GSP will ultimately have to show that Nimara's transfer was funded without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free Brazil from the contract, and Nimar will receive a claim that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
The GSP can precisely be used to hire Nimara and add it to the galaxy of other stars if the funding of the team is taken into account by the rich energy of the Qatari ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of toys, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income to reach a level of profitability in their soccer business.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of WEFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in a huge debt in their pursuit of success were in fact depriving and risking destruction if banks or owners had stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on the debt of clubs and instead turned to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovic in Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with good potential and then seriously spending to improve the team and create a world brand – became a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period, which covers 2018, clubs can lose EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platinum was removed from the presidential post in 2015, his successor at the UEFA Alexander Cheferin is still determined to hold excessive tears.
“It is understood that the FFP is alive, and we will, as we move forward, strengthen the rules,” said Andrea Traverso, an Associated Press agency controlling the FFP at WEFA last week.
Although the PSC will pay the purchase of the Nimara contract at the same time, it may allocate that amount to account for the entire duration of its contract.
Neimar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in annual accounts as costs of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, more severe sanctions were applied to PSGs, as well as to Abu-Dabi, Manchester City.
A fine of 60 million euros has been imposed (the course is $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and it has been prescribed to limit the composition of its team in the League of Champions during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of regular 25.
WEFA is tracking clubs that may try to re-assess its financial inspections by disbursing their income from the company owners.
Even if the Qatari company could propose the GSP, but if the amount of funding was considered to exceed the standard market prices, WEFA would not allow it to be considered as a legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014, when WEFA decided that the amount of funding for SGEI by the Qatar Tourism Office had been disbursed.
It was reported that the part of Nimara's salary in the PSC could be paid by the Organizational Committee of the World Championship 2022 in Qatar.
But the PSG and Qatar-2022 deny that Neimar would be the ambassador of the world champion, and such a maneuver could easily be found by WEFA inspectors.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSC mean that WEFA will be more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported in Thursday by the people familiar with the situation, WEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with the PSC on the transfer of Neimar.
They contacted the Associated Press Agency under anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the PWG.
According to the latest report, in 2015-1016, the GSP received more than 10 million euros in turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
The GSP expects the arrival of Nimara to be a favourable ground for sponsoring transactions, sales of attributes and team logos.
At the club, trade is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of a new game.
The Spanish League has no doubt been concerned that one of the best footballers is missing, and it has tried to interfere with the transfer of Neimar, stating that the PSG is violating the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of financial doping, with the club and the state,” said the Spanish newspaper “AS” President La Ligi Javier Thebas, considering that the final owner of the PSZ is Qatar.
Arsenala Coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnet, shares La Liga's doubts about the funding of the club by the State.
“This is all the consequences of the left-hand participation, and this has completely changed the football landscape in the last fifteen years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It would be very difficult to follow the financial fairground because countries could have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
Order and place of oath shall be determined by the President
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear on the loyalty of the FF, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law has developed a Committee of the Parliament on Law-Making and Construction.
Another week ago, the MPs planned to directly determine the order of the oath.
From the date of the birth of the solemn oath, children under the age of 18, and disabled, should be exempted from the amended text of amendments to the draft law on nationality of the RF, which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of a sworn entry into the citizenship of the FF instead of formal signature of the documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June during a meeting with the speaker, Mr. Wiacheslav Volodini.
The MPs formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill to abolish a decision on extradition of nationality to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 2, art. 205.2, FRF), as well as for aircraft, trains or water transport, but only if this action relates to terrorism (art. 211, FRF).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill was as follows: by formulating documents for citizenship, a person is under promise to comply with Russian law - he has become on the path of extremism, and he violates that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the political factions Vladimir Vasiliev (the only Russia), Gennadius Zuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Girinovski (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (the Justice of Russia) and speaker, Mr. Vajèslav Wolodin.
On 19 May, the Members adopted it at first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on Construction and Law approved the draft law for second reading, but has now been recast.
It now states that the oath order will be established by the President of the FP.
Earlier parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the Law on Citizenship of the RF, stating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn setting before the State Gerbom and the flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the IMF.
However, the text of the bill did not make it clear where such an event should take place - a list of places where possible the location of the RF station is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, offices of the heads of the organs of the holding, municipal education, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be the ZAGS.
Making a solemn oath to obtain the nationality of the RF will take place after officials have verified their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be obtained after the oath has been made, as is the case with the revised text.
A week ago, the project stated that the oath should precede the signing of the order.
The updated text states that the Russian oath will be 18 years old, rather than 14.
There was a rule on which the oath would be exempt from making an oath which was incapacitated or limited, as well as those who could not express, read or sign the oath itself.
In addition, the President of the RF has the right to exempt from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also provides for a special procedure for the admission of Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered Russian-speaking nationals.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making an appropriate statement to the authorised authority of Ukraine.
A notary certified copy of the statement will have to be transmitted to the Russian officials.
Refusal of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons other than those”.
The relevant amendment to the Act was proposed by a group of MPs, including the first Vice-President of DG Ivan Melniki (CPRF), Natalia Polonski, Pavel Krašinniki and Irat Farrahov (the only Russian).
I think many of you know that getting a deal with Ukraine is not real, it's just not possible.
Accordingly, very many people are waiting for their fate on the nationality of the RF, as explained earlier by the head of the mental committee on the construction and legislation of Pavel Krašinnikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the occupation of certain foreign posts would not apply to those who had given up their “other” citizenship in writing and had submitted an old passport to the Russian IMF, but “on its own grounds” had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now forbidden to hold municipal posts, to be admitted to work on facilities and in organizations related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with a dual nationality or a type of residence may not become a Member of the House or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law should enter into force as from 1 September 2017 and that the necessary legislative acts should be prepared by now.
Nostalgia is becoming a ninja in the Dark American Flight and Detective's Tower.
Today's iteration of history is notable at the same time as the glorious days of characters in the 80s; the era of the 90s (approximately when prominent masters David Wayne and Michael Shawwalter made a "State" comedy for MTV); and of themselves, that is, the year 2001, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Radd went to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is a simultaneous increase in our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a Frenchman, she seems to be anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was a surprise, not just because of the absurdistic humor (including the original story of the speaking plant bank, which H. John Benjamin sounded).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached adulthood; this makes it impossible to return to the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults played by adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its sophistication is more unsystemic and includes riffs from the 1990s steel films of the hand-lifting collar.
In one episode, the personage is awarded Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled wheelchairs and a “house of other things since 1991”.
A lot of these steps are the same.
The goodness Cup (Schoalter), now a writer, has not yet been able to get along with Katie (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet given up on virginity.
And there's still a foolish and false conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Showalter) now instigating George Bush-Old (the test parity in the performance of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of French is a retreat from it.
It's especially fun to see a young Radda singing Matt Dillon's song from the "Odinochek", whose character, the former great man Andy now looks old-fashioned.
The success of this French could be random nonsense in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up" until it comes to what I think would be a logical conclusion: "The American Hot summer: twenty years later", where in the last scene the whole company would go to the movie premiere "The American Hot summer".
"Deputy Detective" in the Amazon refers to another kind of nostalgia: memories of the cold war of the Americans, the Explosive Blonde or even the Blesca with its images of the East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, depicts a telefilm: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and Marxist-Lenin road.
The main roles -- Gregor and the idealist Joseph -- are Florin Piersik-younger and Cornelius Ulic, and their dialogues were echoed in English by Chenning Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (police spends time watching chess as Americans could watch football).
The team of well-known voices behind the staff -- including Jenny Slett, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini -- makes it interesting to play in the "think the voice."
But "Deputy Detective" is so concerned with the improbable propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which he often looks like.
Six long episodes are delayed, and funny is not very often.
If you do it slowly, the "Deputy Detective" could better deal with his satire in the spirit of agite prop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the US Embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby, hugging a bunch of hamburgers.
This image tells the imaginary Communist that the Western culture is capable of making an observatory.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not as bad as they are: we are doing so with our own recent history, and with them too.
The Russian Supercoubon Football Championship between Spartacus and Locomotiv is about 30 million rubs.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football League (RFPL) Sergei Pradkin at the press conference.
According to the RFPL chapter, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that by now the tickets for the match were almost gone.
The Spartacus match will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartacus is the current RF champion, and Locomotiv is the owner of Cuba.
Two young hummingbirds cleaned the furniture for 200 thousand rubles
During the days, a 37-year-old employee with a furniture company was contacted by the police.
The man said that he had stolen expensive tools from the shop, which had caused serious damage to his production.
The product was made of a total value of almost 200 thousand rubles: two enemy apparatus, perforator, plumber, plumber.
The guards began to search for criminals and soon came to the people of the Blahoveztan region of Bashcortostan, friends 23 and 24.
According to the media services of the IMF, the media entered the territory of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and issued tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold stolen the first stolen car service.
With regard to them, the theft has already been initiated, and the law enforcement authorities have been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the legitimate owner.
Mr. Medvedev commented on the relationship between the FP and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Hizer Nawert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of RF Dmitria Medvedev regarding the relations of two States.
A former head of the Russian Government stated that, following the adoption of new anthrosian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the FF a full-fledged trade war.
In commenting on those words, Nawart acknowledged that the Russian-American relations were “low” but noted that “cooperation areas” needed to be sought.
"Look at the peace in the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says the diplomat RIA Novosti.
However, the representative of the foreign political authority refused to comment on the statement by the Russian prime minister that sanctions were equivalent to trade wars.
The bill on new sanctions for Russia, Iran and the CDR President of the United States signed Donald Trump last Wednesday.
He acknowledged, however, that the document was unsuccessful and opposed to the American Constitution.
Dior has grown roses from amethyst and quartz
The French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has filled the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
There were five new wheels and three wheels on barges.
Rose Dior Pré Catelan features two new rings and balloons from amethysts, pink quartz and brilliants performed in gliptic technique (hand cutting by stone) and respect for 70-year-olds at home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoria de Castellan was inspired by the roses that grew in its place in Granville, the Christian Dior model, and the Paris gardens of Baghaler and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found guilty of a deterioration in relations with Russia
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, took the floor with great criticism to the members of the congress.
In the view of the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at a low and dangerous level.
"You can thank the congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
Donald Trump has recently signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the PRC.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House circulated the presidential statement that it indicated that the law would not allow the United States to conclude beneficial transactions and would bring more closer to the RF, China and North Korea.
Belorussian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
Entrepreneur Viktor Prokoppenja from Belarus withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of the subsidiary of Sberbank.
His business decision explained the RBC's intention to "focus on other of our planned investments and projects that we are working on".
According to Mr. Prokopani, such a step would be "better time" despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of the Sberbank daughter.
Mr. Prokoppenja became the main applicant for the purchase of the Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NGO rejected the application of the NorvikBank Griegorio Guselnik and of Sayid Gucerieva in July.
The Russian banks began to abandon the Ukrainian market after President Petr Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization -- apart from WTB and Foreign Economic Bank -- became Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of the crime in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy, the RF called the cause of the blockade in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation.
According to him, the peninsula was powerless due to road traffic accidents in the territory of Krasnodar.
As a result, Cuban and related Crimean networks have been shut down by the truck that entered the DTP.
The power failures of major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Specialists have solved the deficiencies over a few hours.
It was originally reported that the cause of the blackout could have been an abnormal heat.
Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have made it possible to hear about a possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unsustainable and left interest rates unchanged in the face of increasing family income pressure.
Specialists of the Bank ' s Money Policy Committee (MPC) voted against 6 to 2 to maintain rates of 0.25 per cent, with fewer members of the Committee expressing increased rates this month, as weak economic growth had weakened its support for growth.
In its quarterly report on inflation, the bank limited its forecast to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that family income pressure would continue, while still expected that inflation would rise to about 3%.
However, the Bank warned that a higher rate in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation rate, and stated that borrowing costs would probably have to be higher than expected in the financial markets.
The Committee also voted in favour of rejecting part of the public package of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of the break-up.
Since the next February, the bank will close the emergency funding plan that it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has reported that it is now expected to provide an additional 15 billion pounds of up to 115 billion pounds in the plan.
In the Bank's decision-making protocol, the Bank said: “According to the main forecasts of MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) will soon remain slow, while the pressure on real family income continues to influence consumption”.
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to stop inflation, there would be a need for “some increase in financial policy”, somewhat higher than expected by markets.
At this point, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “stepping” and “limited”.
The Bank's projected increase in this year and next year is below the forecast made in May, which was 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank has remained unchanged at 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After that news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent slowdown in growth rates was expected to increase; GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the Bank's representative, overall growth will remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason for the joy of households, with high inflation and a slight increase in wages: according to the bank, pressure will increase before it decreases.
The Bank has added that financial policy “cannot prevent” earnings in the next few years, but expects payments “significantly” to be recovered at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared to growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting from the low price of the pound, which compensates for part of the reduced consumption costs.
The decision was taken a year after the rate was reduced to 0.25% in the past August following the shocking outcome of the Euro-Union withdrawal referendum.
It is estimated that it will take four years to fully influence prices and economies.
Before the bank reached its last rate decision, it had grown noise around the expected increase in rates, as inflation had increased to and so severe domestic pressure: three in the committee had requested an increase of 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9% in July, although the bank reported that it was expected to fall and that it was recompensated in the coming months.
According to the Bank, a higher rate compared to the projected 2 per cent is entirely due to the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco's Mortgage Brokers, said: "If you take into account the recent decline in soup rates, the mortgage market will become more competitive again, as creditors demand business opportunities and expect a good year's completion.
The market is particularly favourable to those approaching the end of their existing treaties, since refinancing of loans often with the possibility of a lack of commission, as well as with a low rate, is becoming popular as ever.”
The Public Health Service will prescribe HIV 1000 people for the dispute
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after a battle in the High Court on the financing of a drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposure prevention of HIV (PRE), a pre-exposure tablet, which was proven to reduce the risk of infection in the risk group, by an average of 86 per cent, would now be provided to the health service for the initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal supported the High Court ' s ruling last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the PRE, despite its statement that it should be funded by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called “the most important innovation” by the president of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it “the turning point”.
Before the full launch of the whole of England by April 2018, the Veneological Dispensers in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Cheffield will start registering, and more dispensers will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
According to studies, PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When receiving PREP before sex in the human body, there is sufficient quantity of certain medicines to prevent infection with HIV.
Such medicinal products may be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to the medicinal product are homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose HIV partners are positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Distributors will select appropriate participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals whose partners are not aware of whether their HIV status is inhibited by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and prescribed to doctors of common practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest Veneological Dispenser participating in the programme.
The programme will be worth 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug supply contract this week after the international tender.
The study is designed to assess all possibilities of the PREP for the collection of clinical data on who is the target audience of the medicinal product, its feasibility and its application to a large extent.
“This key innovation should complement and strengthen the broader and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone for more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is addressed in writing to people in need of assistance and at risk, allows for a change in the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, people in the HIV risk group will be given access to a new, open-ended resource, which can be controlled by a partner without discussing it with a view to improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: “The first thing to do now is to make sure that the trial is spread quickly throughout the country, and that none of the risk groups on HIV are forgotten.
Now that we are provided with the PREP, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Dark Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the trial of the PREP, it has been very late for months of delays and delays by the Government.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this chronic infection.
This test will bring us closer to the full understanding of the benefits of the EPR.
It is now important that the test be developed as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
The World Tatar Congress adopted a resolution on the support of the Tatarstan and Russia treaty
The Sixth Meeting of the World Tatar Congress (WCT) adopted a resolution, which noted the importance of maintaining the presidency in Tatarstan.
According to the paper, the post is “good for the recommended form of organization of the highest government in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the whole Tatar people”.
In addition, the meeting stressed the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan in the resolution.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the ethnic, social, economic and social development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
The treaty between Moscow and Kazan has been concluded for 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, Ms. Tatarstan's MPs requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the position of head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only member of the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one called the President.
There have been difficulties in obtaining international driving rights in Russia
IDBDD units have a lack of international driving certificates (IMUs).
To obtain such rights, we have to wait a few weeks, which has become a problem for vacationers who want to go abroad on their car or take it there for a ride.
It should be noted that the situation with international driving licences remains contradictory.
IPU was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights were recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights were recognized in the countries that ratified the Vienna Convention.
However, everything depends on specific police or procedural offices: some require IMI, and some have enough national rights.
In order to ensure that international rights holders still receive, it should be borne in mind that the non-ratified conventions of countries (e.g., the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) have the right not to recognize national rights or IMI.
There is a problem with patterns in almost all IDBDD units, reports Commersant, carrying out a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, the UGIBDDs simply don't issue, the blanks do not last four months.
It can be accessed on the guest website, but it has already grown until mid - August.
In the Red Sea, it is impossible to obtain "for technical reasons", but not in detail, in the Samara region, they say that there are no blanks, and the situation is similar in other cities.
Many mosquitoes have already encountered the problem, and the following reports have been reported more and more frequently in the neighborhoods:
Irina Burmistro: "Think, why can't international rights be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the GIDD offices have finished the blanks.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question of the people who know."
International rights need to be obtained very quickly.
In Moscow, the talent is always far ahead, and the talent is not spent at all (there is, but the talent can't be given).
Some kind of guest portal shows that in Spob, the time is free to go to the figs.
Did anyone try to get in another town?
Does it work?
As explained in the IMF, the requirements for international driving licences have changed, and the Gosavto Inspection Unit is therefore responsible for the delivery of new forms.
This may be related to the deficit, but it is not clear what changes have been made in the past.
Blanky purchases the Special Road Safety Destination Centre (CSNBD) of the IMF RF and then transfers it to the IDBD unit.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with Goznak OO: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand SMEs have been manufactured, 15,000 have been purchased in 2016, 90,000 have been purchased in 2017, but the last contract was concluded with the OOO on July 18th with the "First Print Court" for the manufacture of 70,000.
There's a version that the CNC just failed to conduct a tender in time, which is why a deficit arises.
However, there are other versions of the gap: because of the crisis, many people have become independent not in Europe, but in cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights there are, until the end, is unclear, so people are assured, and therefore there is a high demand for international “steps”.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to submit an examination to confirm their qualifications.
Mintrans made such a proposal.
The International Driving Certificate (IMI) of the new model has been in force since 31 May 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukraine's Justice Minister Pavel Petronko said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the Guardian Portal.
No respectable international company will even put a bullet or a bag there, because it is at risk of losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan, in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia for Crimea.
"That is, in my deep belief, there is actually no prospect of this project," Petronko said.
He added that Russia considered it impossible to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build less large facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, all the stadiums have been destroyed.
"Therefore, I believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have become so remote to join the project," the officer noted.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the tank of the Crimean Bridge.
A massive collection of the Kremlin Bridge road ark was completed on the Church Coast: it will be closed at a height of 45 metres from the construction.
“At the same time, bridgebuilders have prepared a railway ark to be installed on a ferry stand”, reported at the project information centre.
In April, President Vladimir Putin of Russia informed Mintrans Maxim Sokolov that the site was being run with a schedule.
The Crime Bridge unites the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Islands.
In Spain, a ten-year-old official was fired
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) did the chief of the Spanish official Charles Resio have to have?
The permanent walk has grown for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Resio was fired.
But not his direct boss.
What's not happening to bureaucrats in the world.
The inhabitants seem to have been used to all the holocausts of the "servants of the people."
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those whose taxes are not bad.
This time, the "sensation" was sorry about Spain.
There, the archive officer of Valencia Carles Resio has been out of work for ten years.
As a result, he received a regular complaint.
It's all solid, 50 grand a year.
And here's Mr. Resio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was dismissed by the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
During the investigation, it was found that every morning a malicious walker came to the office at 7:00 to check in on the electronic system.
And he went home.
Once again, he appeared at work at 4:00 so that he could see again in the system that he left.
That's 10 years.
It was also known that all the leisure time the walker devoted himself to drawing comics at home.
The members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly now think of how to punish Mr. Resio, who could not know how to "work actively" in his workplace.
The Judges propose to protect from the Presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HR) under the direction of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The SPC proposes that the powers of the Presidents of the courts be limited and that they be elected.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HR wishes to introduce special districts that will not be associated with the administrative and territorial division of the RF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the presidential order.
The SHR has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the PSC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the members of the Council.
The meeting with members of the Council on 8 December 2016 discussed, among other things, cases of judicial proceedings, as well as issues of public control in places of detention (see “U” of 9 December).
The work of the SPC has resulted in 25 proposals concerning both the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors and the financing of courts and legal education.
One idea of human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the Presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of other judges.
If a candidate for a judge has successfully passed a competition and has received the support of the judicial community, the President of the court, in the opinion of the SPC, must submit him for appointment without having the right to refuse as the law now permits.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases to judges.
In doing so, experts are allowed, perhaps a specially written computer program.
The SPC also considers that the Chairperson is not entitled to “prefer the results of a judge’s qualification, initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, take decisions on the establishment of additional material payments”.
In this connection, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the “election of the Presidents of the Courts themselves” and to “give them powers for a relatively non-permanent term with binding rotation”.
All the presidents of the courts (from the Republic to the districts) are now appointed for six years by the President to represent the President of the Supreme Court of the RF.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the SPC proposes to reorganize the appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The SPC says that “it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized, not at the level of the regional judicial authorities, in the FP entities, but in the districts of the courts”.
The experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are "judgment districts" that do not correspond to the administrative division in the FP, but that guarantee greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty in using the "telephone law".
The World Council of Judges proposes to strengthen the people's advisers to consider, with their participation, some “civil and administrative categories”.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's just our proposals," explained "U" member of the SPC, a judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamar Morštakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only for the HR, but also for the Supreme Court (HR), which had not yet revealed its proposals.
There is still time to carry out the mandate of the Office of the Office of the Secretary-General and the Human Rights Officer in the Office of the Secretary-General.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effective the RF is in ensuring the independence of justice, the President of V.S. Vejèslav Lebedev should be until 1 September.
Living a long life: half-life and smart designers have turned this small apartment into an apartment in Earls Court.
Joan Lee, a former real estate repair banker, moved from a space house in Nightsbridge to Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a nice typical house in Queen Anna's style, and for the benefit of the new design, it says that Joan did not pick up her stuff and move again.
"I used to live with my ex at Nightsbridge in a much bigger place," says Joan.
“I wanted something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high areas.
I fell in love with her, and I offered the price that day."
Since the first visit to the apartment in 1,000 square feet, it has been completely rebuilt.
It was originally an apartment with one bedroom complex – to get into the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and pools to get the maximum benefit from the generous height of the floors.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural design studio Duck & Shed to use 12th-foot floors and create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be acceptable to Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms above each other, so the architectural task was to create a pool where it could be fully grown.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the letter.
“Working with permanent structures is very complex,” he explains.
“We had to put rooms in such a way that they were above each other, and they didn’t have to go down.
It was not simply necessary to build a simple platform, but to avoid structures so that they could be at the right height and allow the space above and below to be used.”
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two fully sized rooms above each other in the remote area – and still very interesting.
With a pudding through an important long-lasting light window from the Retrouvius, there is a kind of a squeaky guest down.
The gold-separate ceramic furniture, silver accents and vintage lighting equipment from Serža Muya are a design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
The short corridor covered with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror panel looks like a window in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinets serve to store the entire John vessel.
In order to create a feeling of more spacious space, the beauty of the hotel can be built into a kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door like it's in the garage.
“In this case, engineering has been employed,” said Erfan about an armed steel wood-volcanic shield door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it’s very easy.”
With reasonable use of space and storage facilities, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“At the end of the day, the sex scene is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your real estate is valued for,” Erfan says.
“Immediately, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on sex.”
They were able to increase the area of sex by using quality materials that added shine to the area.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the home,” says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with the electric conductor in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts."
This is evidence that, for a good design and an elevated apartment meter, something usually turns out to be amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
Government approved the establishment of a commission on cultural policy
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a State Cultural Policy Commission.
The decision was published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the Commission's main task will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Chief Commission shall be appointed Vice-President of the Government of the RF.
The composition of the Commission will be adopted separately.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved a plan for the implementation of the public cultural policy strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides for measures to enhance the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to maintain a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 has decreased to a minimum of eight years
Consumer prices in the G20 countries have decreased to a minimum of eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal with reference to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that in June 2016 inflation rates were 2 per cent lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a 0.1 per cent decrease in Russia's consumer price index.
The Authority therefore recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The Russian inflation target, according to Minfin, is 4.1 per cent.
Mineconomies, however, believe that the target has already been achieved, according to the department, is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illegal cutting of the bicycle rope
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against the illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on environmental development in the Bicalian Natural Territory.
In the process, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergei Donski noted that the bill had been prepared earlier.
He allowed the forest to be cut off while the fires were being extinguished, and the Government planned to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President said that the project should be monitored to ensure that the cut-off process “did not break all the order”.
Donsky noted that the bill implied control by the PMS and the supervisory authorities.
Media: VSU fighters secretly negotiate with Colonel Donbass
A regular telephone connection has been established through an armed conflict in Donbasse.
Fighters of the opposing parties are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and they are not aware of this communication in headquarters.
The U.S.U.S. boys and Colonels of Donbass have made contact on a hundred-phone secret from their high command.
On 4 August, Strana.ua reported on this with reference to participants in the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on the telephones every day.
Communication is not at home at all: the commanders are trying to achieve some “tactic arrangements”.
The outcome of such discussions is often a resurgence at a certain point in the front.
Journalists have been informed of the cases when a congratulating officer on his birthday was received from his formal enemy because of the front line.
The VSU and the DND and LNR militias are in the wake of the separation since spring 2014, when Ukraine launched a war against Donbass.
Mid-MID has dissuasived the blocking of UNSB's statements on FP embassies attacks
In the Russian foreign policy department, the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives who blocked UN-Sovereze's statements in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the RF Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian MID.
The department recalled that the Russian Embassy's territory in Damascus on 2 August the third time a month was attacked by terrorists of Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham (former "Jabhat An-Nusra" banned by the FF) and "Filek Ar-Rakhman".
Bearing in mind that the international community unanimously qualified as a terrorist organization, and UNSCRs called against that structure, the IMF noted that “it is clear that the Nussian attacks should be met with total unconditional and firm condemnation, and that the evaluations against diplomatic missions should have no ambiguity”.
However, as underlined in the diplomacy, “for the third time a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council have, by and large, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard draft statement of the Security Council for the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital”.
The desire to show diplomatic solidarity with us let us remain conscious of those delegations.
"The most disturbing thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to come up with new provocations and acts, gives them a sense of impunity," they said in the Middle Ages and added that "these barbarians do not wish to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them."
Vladimir Putin spokesperson for limiting the number of foreign business inspections
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, said during the project meeting in the Far East that the number of out-of-date inspections by entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, as well as that it was necessary to limit the time for inspections by ten cuts.
“Foreign checks are usually carried out without agreement with the Public Prosecutor’s Office; only 2-3 per cent agrees with the Public Prosecutor’s Office, all of which go independently,” quoted the President of the TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be forbidden to remove servers and hard disks on businesses.
In addition, in the opinion of the President, business associations should be entitled to protect the interests of their members in court.
"I hope that this will bring a certain position to the attention of business-related cases, or of a violation of the entrepreneurship law," said the Head of State.
As “U” reported, the moratorium on planning checks has increased the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs.
In May, an interview was conducted with the President of Russia, Boris Titova, who found that there had actually been a replacement of planning checks for non-planned persons (the proportion of those with them increased from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), redistributions (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent) as well as checks on citizens' statements (growth from 15 to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More details on business checks in the "U" material "The small business has come from the other side".
Brothers fight for the real estate empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest in the state of Victoria's empires in real estate worth more than $500 million, 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
The former director of Carlton's football club and co-founder Colin de Lutis live in the court of Turk through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him in the Supreme Court for a division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but in the Supreme Court there is still a heated dispute about the terms of divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna's brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a shop in Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
Money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's list includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in the Zolot Beach and in Mount Buller and malls in the suburbs.
According to his late father Colin, whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, he owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colina's property is 316 million and Paul is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stone for Paul.
"The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first demonstrations in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts to reconcile, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers will now dispute who will control the existing business, from which Paul thought Colin had excluded it.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but he accuses Paul of mismanagement of some objects.
In evidence given to Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he hoped to settle the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority," he wrote.
Judicial costs are growing as a snowcomb: hundreds of pages of evidence, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both parties have attracted the most famous lawyers, including Queen Alan Myers' lawyer, and the best traps.
Ms. De Lutis and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s they had managed dairy bars and gastronomy, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of giants.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last classes of the school, and Paul was then a boy (approximately 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis said that they were hoping to hand over their possession to the sons without conflict with Louis, who died in 2012.
"Luiji often told me he didn't want the brothers to understand in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul and Luke, and Mark were “unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL Club Board of Directors and, according to Eddie McGira's 2015 biography, the best other star.
Fairfax Media was in contact with Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered only Colin, a text message saying that since the case had not yet been dealt with in court, "I have the truth to say something special."
"I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a complaint against me and bring our family's name to trial," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in evidence that he was trying to meet his brother’s requirements.
"Our father doesn't want to see Paul and me arguing in court," he said, adding, "he still hopes for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seems to have spread.
"Our case will soon be brought before the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trampa apparatus plans to limit the information to the President.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly is really gonna make it.
In that case, he'll be the first.
"Politics" reports that the new head of the White House machine plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trampu, including news from the media, hoping to keep the boss in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Dowzy reports.
"At the meeting, which was held by John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House, with the lead of the apparatus on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trump, which he hopes to resolve: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told staff that information should be transmitted through it, in paper form or in briefings, because the President would be better able to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis is quite reliable, but others have already suffered a failure, trying to calm the Trump, tracking the receipt of information.
President Trampa's relationship with television was a few decades ago - and now that he is in White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair lighting of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had received a fair light in the publications that could have been convinced," said Sam Nanberg, former electoral advisor in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in "Police", that "according to the six former members of the electoral headquarters to keep the Trampa habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to monitor the constant flow of information coming to him."
Okay.
But the idea that Trampa's habit of writing on Twitter was "under control" was just funny.
Perhaps these members of the electoral headquarters know something that we don't know, for example, that if they didn't, the Tromp tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump hasn't published.
If his staff had saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to stop the Trump from melting oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to move forward their agenda, providing the Trump material, whether reliable or not, that confirms their views.
"Politics" - just as in this story - wrote in May about the willingness of advisers to constantly inform the President.
Here is an example described by reporter Shein Goldmacher:
"The current and former staff members of Trump say that Trump can react very sharply to negative reports in the press, especially with dangerous leaks of information, and will not be relieved until he finds who was behind them.
So it happened at the end of February when someone pushed the president's print with GotNews.com, the Web site of the Internetprovoker Charles K. Johnson, in which the Vice-Chairman of Katie Wells accused her of being "suffering for some escape" in the White House.
It is not important that Johnson is permanently arrested on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he has not presented specific facts, or that he has committed false accusations in the past and then rejected them.
Trump read the article and began to question staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that then the head of the apparatus Rains Pribus and the secretary of the machine Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that received Trump and document them".
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulse, and his assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen Procurator ' s Office fights HIV dissident
The Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the Kalinininge Parasus judgment in Tumeni, which ended the criminal case against a local resident whose daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court dismissed her from responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished so as not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case for the Tumeni resident was initiated at 1 p.m. 109 CFU (cause of insecurity death) in April after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV 4B infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection," explained the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Tumen Region.
The criminal case was brought to the Kalinin court of Tumeni, which on 25 July decided to terminate it.
An application was made by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that “he forgave the woman, she had no claim to her, she had done harm and apologized”.
The Prosecutor ' s Office did not agree with the decision of the court and appealed that the decision to terminate the case should be annulled and re-examined.
The girl died, and it's impossible to swallow the damage caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, despite the recommendations of the doctors, refused to investigate and treat the child from a dangerous infection," reported the prosecutor ' s office.
In the view of the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise it would be followed by other HIV dissidents.
As reported in the Tumen Centre for AIDS, about 12 children with HIV are currently in the Tumen area without medical assistance due to the refusal of parents.
“And the situation has already improved, during the year of the special group of half-parents who have categorically refused to treat children from HIV, have changed their opinion, have been able to carry out the diagnosis, have become a pioneer,” said the Press Secretary of the AIDS Centre Elena Loseva.
According to her, it was impossible to legally influence parents, and not all HIV-infected children were able to find them - mothers did not allow them to investigate, hide, and escape from hospitals.
What Are the Dangers of HIV Dissidents?
At the end of last year, the peterburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Doctors and AIDS-servicing NGOs call such views anti-medicine and pose a serious threat to their distribution.
The brutal photo session, which ended with a tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Greek Railway Station in Hmelnik.
The fun company of young people who had been trained walked by a bridge over the railways, where the freight train had just been standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make an effective self on the wagon roof, FACTAM reported in the police communications sector in the Hmelnik area.
The guy began to get off the bridge on the train, but because of his lack of supervision, he got stuck behind the power line and got hit by a current.
Luckily, it became known to the station's distributor, who immediately called for "an emergency."
Before the patient arrived, they were transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized in the fire department at the Hmelnik district hospital.
Men were diagnosed with fevers of 1 to 2 degrees.
His condition is now estimated to be stable.
The lawmakers are reminding us that in recent times, there has been a growing popularity of extreme self-defence on multiple-trailers, bridges, and transport.
The police call on people to be vigilant and not to allow such photos, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Venus
In the ancient Venus, there could be oceans.
The French scientists suggested this.
Experts have developed a computer model that has demonstrated the water education process on the surface of the planet, says Science News.
It was found that at the beginning of her history, there were oceans where there were 10 percent more water than now on Earth.
Previously, the Week Arguments wrote that, according to scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in their studies concluded that the water facility was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured as a result of the shooting in the park in San Francisco
Three people were injured in San Francisco as a result of the shooting, reported Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where a large number of visitors were present.
According to the witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them pulled out weapons and started shooting at people.
The outward appearance of the wicked could not be considered, since they had all but the eyes.
Another medical assistance was provided, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park is a popular place among locals and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during the night club shooting in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several visitors were injured trying to leave the room.
Louna rock group will present a new album in Barnaule
The Louna rock concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album "Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated religions of the year.
The collection prepares a conceptual show that will be the brightest in the concert history of the group.
The "Wonderful New World" is the fourth album of the Russian rock band Louna.
His name is related to the famous novel anti-utopia O. Haxley "O strange new world".
The new songs do not cross the book, but they tell about a society that lives by the law of anti-topia, “the blind belief in propaganda and the imposed values”.
Collecting money on the album group helped the audience: more than 1200 people supported the project on Planeta.ru.
Louna released her first album "Do Gromche!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, the Louna group gave a symphonic orchestra at Crokus City Hall with the program "Pearl of Peace".
As part of the Lucine Gevorkian (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas-guitar), Ruben Kazarian (guitar), Sergey Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzburski (barabana).
The concert will be held at the Barnaul Club, Pharaoh, on 17 October, at 19:00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the wanted groups on the Russian rock stage.
The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debut was held in 2009.
The Group has won several rounds in various hit parade nominations of the "Dear Duzin".
Gypsies crossed the ravages and returned to "Million Street"
Some of the most powerful residents of the West Midlands are once again in conflict with the determined gypsies who have overcome the harsh municipal authorities of the ravine to reoccupy the field near their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 homes on wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Solihalla, which was called the “Million Street”.
When they brought with them soldiers, infantry and numerous homes on their knees, they returned after they had been driven out no further than in May, and they were not disturbed by the ruins of the city authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a breach in the defence facilities and opposed its vehicles through a site that had been left unprotected to leave the ground for the fall.
The people who were upset attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying that he was “inability to solve this problem”.
An anonymous local resident said, “They came here at night on Monday, after they had been driven from Bentley Het, where they used to throw stones.”
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are totally unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsys were here in May, chased them, and here they are again.
Last night more Gypsy arrived, and today maybe even more.
“The Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term judicial decisions to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like the fact that I keep paying municipal taxes, and the municipality can't even put an end to this."
One of the local residents who wanted to remain anonymous said, "This is ridiculous, we just saw these gypsies go away for the last time, and, please, this attack continues."
This time they were multiplied, and we saw the ostrich falling down on his face.
The representative of the Municipality of Solihalla said: “We know of an illegal camp on the ground next to Streetsbrook Road and we cooperate with the Solihalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action so that they can be persecuted as soon as possible.”
In order to help us collect the evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal conduct to the police on phone 101.
This enables us to make a presentation of the situation that will be examined by the court when we present our case to them.
The wine industry "New World" is acting on Crime.
The GUP of the Republic of Crimea “New World” is decided to take action by transforming the “New World” Spanish Wines into the OAO“ New World, as directed by the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anuhina.
100% of the shares of the company will remain in the ownership of Crimea.
The statutory capital of the shareholding company is 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares of a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea has stated that if there is no funds to modernize the plant within the next three years, there will be a threat that the plant will be stopped.
The amount of basic funds per enterprise is about 60-70 per cent.
The enterprise needs 1.2 billion rubbs to be modernized, and because of its organizational and legal nature, it is obliged to pay 50% of its income in the budget.
What remains is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is problematic, talking about attracting loans from large credit organizations hard," said the headlines of Crimea Sergei Petlin in April of this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the 2017 privatisation forecast.
It was proposed that it be held and displayed on the market.
The source of the Interfax in the Crimean authorities estimated the potential value of sales of the company in $40 million, and the investment of the investor in modernization was still $30 million.
In 2016, the New World increased the production of juries by 2.8 per cent compared to 2015 to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World was about to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by the Prince of Lviv Golicin as a wine-making plant in the name of the New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Lower-city third-class diggers destroyed more than 40 graves
The MVG staff in the Netherlands have established the identity of the citizens who have destroyed 46 graves in the city of Liskivo.
A third - grade student was a criminal.
The first statement that the burial sites were damaged by the unknown occurred in Russia ' s OMVD on the Liskov region on 27 June.
In this regard, 24 people have been approached by the police.
As a result, a criminal case has been initiated under article 244 of the FC RF “Distorting, damaging or desecrating burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police found suspects, two students aged 8 and 9 were found.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the memory fall, and that led them to hooligan activities.
Preventive activities were carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is strengthening its tone with regard to NGOs that are saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities," said Minister of Interior Mario Minniti in an interview with the Customs daily Stampa.
The warning to Minniti was the next day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, suspecting that its crew is actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been working all year, has refused to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartozio.
"There is and will remain a high priority for us to save human life, so we are very sorry that we cannot now continue our activities in the search and rescue zone," said the organization's statement in the neighbourhood.
"We will be able to assess all the charges now made only after we have gathered all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have followed the Juventa ship, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
Its crew is suspected that the entire lifeboats were taken on board by migrants sent directly to them by human traffickers and allowed smugglers to leave along with the boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting was expected to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the indictment material published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coastal authorities that control rescue operations in this area rather than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes, in particular, that juvenile courts will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
While only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations agreed to submit to the Code: "Sapti Children", Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activa Distant Entities" from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary, but acceptable, provided they would not lead to any “significant change or confusion” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are those who received the Nobel Prize for Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
In the meantime, Minniti said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libyan coastal security and cooperation with local mayors bore fruit.
"In the last few days, we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He reported on the plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on initiatives for economic development and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict"
The RF authorities have recently significantly stepped up their policies in the Libyan direction, and the delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been frequented with visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on the internal settlement of the Middle East and Gosmund, the assistant head of the Czech Republic, Lev Denjov, said, "U", what goals Moscow pursues in this region and to whom it pays a stake.
The contact group on Libya, which you lead, is almost unknown.
Let's say the contact group in Ukraine knows everything about her.
And here's the veil of secrets.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The Contact Group was set up on the initiative of the IID RF and the State Word.
Its activities are run by Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Deputy of the Duma of Chechnya. - "U").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the speaker of Mr. Wiacheslav Vollodin.
A great deal to set up a group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker Mechanic Cebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "U").
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military experts, representatives of Gosmuda, was formed, supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadirov.
How'd you get what you led her?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to take the lead in the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the release of sailors from Mechanika Cebotareva.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - and by Tripoli (which is based on the recognized UN Government in the head of Faiz Saradze. - "U") and Tobruk (the parliament's residence that opposes and supports the Government and supports Major Khalif Haftar, controlling the eastern areas of Libya. - "U").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (the Deputy Prime Minister of Libya, "U"), we were able to agree quickly on the release of Russian sailors.
At that time, it was decided to make better use of these contacts, to establish a contact group.
Its objective is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to stress in particular that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, we have a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are in Libya all the time?
There are now five people in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience in force structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include a group of experts on the region, representatives of the Middle East RAN Institute.
None of our staff are in Libya on a permanent basis, so far there is no need.
There are now Russian military advisers in Libya, instructors.
And if so, whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the discussions and publications on this matter are not valid.
But in your contact group, the former soldiers are...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or closed to a certain point for us in the city, such as Misurata (based on the teams of police, which played a role in the conquest of Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi in 2011 and which have been significantly intensified in the years to come).
We arrived in Missouri in January of this year.
We were scared, they said there were no Islamists, no terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to examine the real military potential that is responsible for why there are such hearings as are actually the role of the Islamics there.
In Missouri, we met with all the representatives of the teams involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016 the city on the Mediterranean coast was turned away from the soldiers banned in Russia by the Islamic State, the "U").
We wanted to see them, meet these people, check that they played a crucial role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not Khalif Haftar, who attributed themselves to them.
And what is your conclusion?
The Islamic State in Libya won the Haftar?
This isn't him.
Haftar had operations on another front in Benghazi.
And with the IG in Sirte, there were structures that had subjugated to the Government in Tripoli.
And, indeed, we have invited people in Russia to carry out this anti-terrorist operation.
The visit extended from 19 to 23 April of this year, and the Libyan delegation was adopted by the Council of the Federation, the Duma, the Middle Ages and the Russian Guard.
We understand that you are in all the Libyan regions and that you are likely to represent the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think arrangements will be made for the ceasefire, for the elections reached at the end of July in Paris, by Khalif Haftar and Faiz Saradz?
Or, again, as has been the case in the past, the agreements will be disrupted, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to take power unilaterally?
For us, the fact that Saradz and Haftar have agreed to a regular meeting has already become a good signal has not been possible as long as it has been possible.
In the recent past, both leaders have reacted extremely negatively to each other.
As for Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftara, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when they were in Missouri, and Haftar was aboard the Russian aircraft Admiral Kuznetz that day.
It was a coincidence.
But they did not believe in Egypt at all.
They said to us, "You are probably very brave people who have come to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not only support Haftar, but we engage with all key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Hafter have been together.
Does understanding with the Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he has been taught twice in the USSR?
So does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But what we've learned, of course, makes it easier to talk to him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we communicate with soldiers in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet with generals who have been taught either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here's what they're saying in Russian.
And they're going to Russia, and they're going to experience some kind of nostalgia about it.
Do you consider the early abolition of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan allies interested in supplying Russian weapons?
We are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not like to arm each other in harming each other.
We would like everyone to be in about the same position.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to make its withdrawal.
Libya is now actively advancing the process of constitutional development.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise decisions, achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections must take place, as was the case at the meeting of Saradha and Haftar.
If the elections are held and a legitimate authority is finally elected (and none of the parties are currently in possession of such a status), the issue of the withdrawal of the arms embargo may be raised in the UN Sovereign.
To raise this issue is now pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of conflict.
During the media days, information was received that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees flying from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using their ties with the Libyans?
How far, for example, is it realistic that the Haftara teams will establish control of the coast and put an end to the anti-trafficking business that transforms immigrants into Europe?
A very timely question.
We're actively working on it.
The Italians are in need of support from Russia, because Moscow is engaged in dialogue with Hafter, and with Saradze, and with Misuratah and with the south of the country.
In this regard, the tribes of southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Does this mean that the South is crossing the flows of migrants in further raids?
I mean, I mean, did the bussies go back to the Nigerian migrants?
We're trying to do that.
But it's not that simple.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to enable the South to unite in the negotiation process between Saradez, Hafter and the tribes in the south.
But for the first time, we would like to see the unity of views on this issue between Hafter and Saradzem.
The head of the Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saradz, is considered an Islamist who advocates the introduction of Sharia.
How many radical views does it hold?
Would this not be an obstacle to relations with Russia or the West?
I'll tell you my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he, on the other hand, is an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamics in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself held the position that Libya should be a totally normal country -- moderately Islamic, open peace.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
How does he have such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that were not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, there is legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not going there.
And we got all the cards mixed up and started talking to Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we have already begun this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the public oil company of Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosnefti Igorj Sechin concluded the deal, directly from Tripoli.
Two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil from Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do to her?
I think I'm reselling.
What other economic interests in Libya do Russia have?
In plans to sign contracts with Muammar Kaddafi.
These include the previous transport agreements (railway construction), energy (electrication) and a number of others.
Do the lions have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as with Iran, is it about the oil exchange scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't care about these issues directly.
Indeed, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main one.
We're actually doing a peacekeeping job there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans deal with each other so that they can establish their own order, and Libya has ceased to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main task of helping the Libyan people and expelling terrorists from there.
Do you have any information on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical fighters from Russia or other former USSR countries?
One of the objectives of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that there is no exit from Russia and other countries of the former USSR to date.
He said that he had about 50,000 records of telephone conversations between Islamic and radical groups (in Libya. - "U") and the Russian word did not sound there.
What kind of States are these fighters from then?
I don't want to go into these details.
Then we'll form the question differently.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans, no more than 5% of them.
The rest are coming.
Could Moscow conduct internal negotiations on Paris?
There are plans like that.
We are conducting active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and we have expressed our readiness to come to Moscow or the Great.
When can such negotiations take place?
Now it's hard to say.
A few more visits should be made, and then I hope that clarity will be expressed regarding the time and venue of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the charity collects money for a precious gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Macola, in the underground museum of the Mélihovo, who has DCP, brain hydrocephaly and complete blindness, will receive a special flight route on 5 August.
The useful presentation will be given by Saše, Minister of Culture of the Moscow area of Oksana Kosareva and Director of the Constantin Bobkov Museum.
The money for the coach was collected during the charity “Don’t Stop Doing Good”, which took place in Melihova on July 15th in the day of the memory of the Czech Republic.
Recently, Marafona in the museum received a letter from Sashi, who lives in the village of Manuskino in the Czech Republic, saying, "I have no eyes at all, so I asked Mom to write this letter."
"I would very much like to get a runway in a gift so that my legs become strong, and I could hear how I learned to walk."
And here's Sachin's dream!
After being handed over to the museum, Concert Postscriptum will be a famous pianist who deserves to be a Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, to fill the gaps in popular classical productions.
During the charity marathon in Melichova, the choirs of Voznesa David Desertina, the bells of Master Ili Drozdihin, the students of the Moscow Conservatory name P.I. The Czech and Russian Academy of Gnesins, the artists of the Melichov Theatre "Chehov Studio".
For visitors, auctions were held, book fairs were organized, and the sale of souvenir products with a maraphon logo was beneficial.
The Mélihovo Museum Commander took the initiative to make the Commemoration Day of the Czech Republic on 15 July the one day of charity in all the Museums of Podmoskovia.
The 30-year-old resident of Olevska Zitomir County, near the local football stadium, shot several times at the side of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was upset by the noise, FACTAM reported in the communications department of the GI.
After that, the man entered the nearby coffee shop.
There was a conflict in the building, during which a man used a gunshot device to shoot with the resin bullets, wound one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old is provided with the necessary medical care and no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical services arrived at the scene, but the shots were hidden by that time.
The law enforcement officers established his identity and detained him on the same day, August 2.
He couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a device to shoot the reindeer pulses that was sent to the experiment.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings under article 296 (holiganization) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for a period of 3 to 7 years.
In Kiev, in the area of Tatarsky Street on the night of 28 July, a shooting occurred.
The sentence of Michel Carter for the suicide of Conrad Roy
The population of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for having caused the suicide of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, by means of text messages and telephone calls.
Michel Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months at the end of the test period and five more years at the end of the test period.
Carter was found guilty of the unintended murder of Conrad Roy in June, which ended on 13 July 2014.
Father Roya said at the hearings on Thursday: "My family was killed in a storm.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free before the appeal.
She had been threatened for a maximum period of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy had suffered mental distress.
Carter, dressed in red blouses and cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, rubbing his hands and taking his eyes off.
"With her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor declared.
"She stopped his life to improve hers.
She didn't accept responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show no respect."
But lawyer Carter said it was "a tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his view, her “age, age, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions”.
The prosecutor read Roy Lynn Roy's mother's statement saying, "It's never been a day when I didn't mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and of how I do it - I try to support his sister, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said she was constantly haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his child's aunt.
"The man who has always been with me from my birth is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of his life," she said.
This case would appear to be a legal precedent, since Massachusetts had no law that would provide for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found in a car dead with symptoms of gas poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the whole country when it was known that it was inspired by Carter's suicide.
"You can hang yourself, hang out with the roof, hang yourself with a knife, I don't know how many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death when he slept with his family.
In a few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to put on a fire, and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death and prevented her from communicating with the press so that she could not get what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter have been split.
One of the few who protected Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British neighbour in Italy two years later.
30-year-old Knox published her special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugenie Bouchev: "I let Langford go like a high-flight bird."
One of the best basketball players of the one UTB League of 33-year-old Kit Langford left UNESCO.
The withdrawal of the American Defence Forces commented by the President of UNIKS Eugeni Bouchev.
Kit made this decision on family circumstances, told Eugenie Bouchev.
He's got a little kid, a woman who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go see him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons in UNIKS, and in each match he showed a high level, and he scored 100%.
That's why I let him go like a high-flight bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and in his career.
Keith Langford played at the Chinese club for three years, won the Silver One League 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the prize for the most successful Eurolygia season.
He picked 21.75 points on average for a match.
This result has been the second since 2004 when this prize was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second player in the history of Eurolygia, who won the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with the Chinese "Schenjen", Eurohops informs.
The American is expected to conclude a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second in July of the Eurology Star that goes to the Chinese Championship.
Previously, the Chinese CBA moved to the former Panatineicos centre, Jannis Burusis.
Sunburned tourist from Podmoskovya evacuated by helicopter in Adige
Adhesive rescuers today evacuated from the mountain area of the Republic of the sub-muscular tourist, which received the strongest sunburns.
The man was resting in the Pischt shelter at a height of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist has had an increased pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
Rescuers were approached by a tour group leader who told them that the fires of the man had been fired.
Audi has to be modified to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW, stated that they would propose upgrading the software to more than 350,000 cars.
The Chairman of BMW said that the company considered that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, meaning European cities, including Munich, where BMW had been able to prohibit or restrict the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Thursday that he modified the three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel output.
None of the companies called their step back.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with the carbon dioxide rules.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The value of the vehicle manufacturers of the installation of equipment that neutralises the exhaust gas of diesel vehicles is also increasing and maintaining the competitive price of cars is becoming difficult.
While the German automakers were under close attention, the Government of Chancellor Angela Merkel also accused them of being inflexible and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the errors of Folkswagen, which have hidden the use of so-called "damaging devices" that, during the test, have been able to transmit the number of hazardous gases emitted in order to comply with the rules and have been turned off under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several leaders of Folkswagen were convicted, and the others were prosecuted on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department was arrested in Germany as part of the Audi engine development group.
The former manager, Zacqueo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, was therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought before a court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subject to a German criminal investigation involving Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to deal with European emissions rules and increased the investigation previously concentrated in the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may create serious problems with Folkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of a disproportionately high share of Folkswagen's income.
In Astrakhani, a coffee visitor was paid by false money
The police received a report from the bank's staff on the recosting of the money received from the company, a suspicious buyer with a denomination of 5,000 rubles.
The study conducted at the Expert Criminalist Centre showed that it was false.
According to the UMVD of Russia in the Astrakhan area, the banknote has been distributed to one of the coffee visitors who bought a shourmum.
It should be noted that the case was not equipped with a buyer ' s trueness device.
Currently, police officers are setting up individuals involved in the manufacture and sale of a reportedly fake RF CB ticket.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment of up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the IMF calls on the people of the Astrakhan area to be careful in financial operations; trade facility workers are encouraged to establish tools to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a "adsk" planet on which even iron can swim.
For the first time, when the stratosphere of the giant exoplanet called WASP-121b was studied, astrophysics were astounded at its temperature, which was able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Specialists have pointed out that water molecules are so lighted up by the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope has sealed the light of the water molecule on this gas giant: it's a high temperature that forces the water in the atmosphere of the planet to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "burning Jupiter" gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the Solar System, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
This year only lasts 1.3 "earth" days on the exoplanet, and its gas envelope is down to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but now there are fears that climate change is threatening it.
Lavanda has become worse because of drought and infectious diseases; this has caused constant pain to scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Provence Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, said: “Lavanda in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years this plant has experienced the effects of climate change: the spring and especially the autumn of the rains has become much smaller.
This affects the life of the lavender.
And there are also small drops of corn coming up from the leaves, and microbacterials carrying them; and in the dry season there is much water for them."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very expensive in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "Instead of very long bones with a large number of large colors, we have small, undeveloped, weakened or not at all.
Therefore, we have fewer parts of the oil."
The decisions currently under consideration include improving the distribution of water and slowing the evaporation from soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the extraction of more dry varieties.
Ambassador of Winter University-2019 met with the students of the Red Sea
A two-time hockey world champion, Ambassador of Winter University-2019, Alexander Semin met early with the starters of hockey and gave autographs to patients.
The meeting took place in the winter of the 2019 University of Winter within the thematic week of hockey with Shibo.
Any visitor of the tent could walk on the end of the field with an artificial ice.
In addition, stadiums, victorias and games with the play of the souvenir production of student games were organized, disbanding the aerobics federation.
50 schoolchildren attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys as much as possible to engage in sports and stressed that the most important thing in the early stages of education was the sincere work and the public desire to do hockey.
"Hello, there's a place in Krasnoyarsk like the Winter University 2019 hat, where starters can directly ask team coaches," said the champion.
It should be noted that promoting student sport and healthy lifestyle among red-haired people is helping the Ambassadors of the Winter University of 1919.
The University Shatter will work throughout the summer season until 25 September, reports the Winter University 2019 press service.
The words of Medvedev were commented on in Mr.
The official representative of the U.S. Department of State, Hizer Nawert, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev, said that there was a need to find a "interoperable area" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to “improve bilateral interaction”.
For example, Nawart referred to Syria as a peace agreement for such successful cooperation.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work together," the diplomat said.
However, Nawart refused to comment on Medvewa ' s claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, then she has, of course, the right to speak, but more on this subject I can't say anything," said the representative of Mr.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the Head of Government of the RF Medvedev said that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, ending the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Bears also stated that US sanctions would be effective for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that the American “pure game” is the tromp.
Lost in Sub-Mosaic Bodibuilder found himself on a lost memory dock
Bodibuilder Shamil Hanmetov lost his way to Noginsk on 25 July under very picantial conditions: he left the car room to go to the bathroom.
Seven days without success were sought out by the well - known and local residents.
And Shamil was found on a foreign branch in Ramensk.
He found it completely naked in his own bathroom.
The Dagestan sportsman couldn't explain how it happened here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and the passport was gone.
The identification of the person helped to make announcements about his or her disappearance.
The doctors who came out of the hospital recorded a partial memory loss and brain damage in Hanmetov, reports the Mash tabloid.
Perhaps sportsmen are waiting for other surprises.
The criminals who kidnapped Shamil may have already been in his apartment, the keys from which he also had the keys.
Oil gas revenues exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles in July
The actual oil revenues received as a result of July 2017 exceeded the estimated $7.4 billion, reports the Ministry of Finance.
The excess, as explained by the department, was mainly due to a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as the actual increase in the production of gas and the export volume of oil products at the projected levels.
"The deduction of the federal budget revenue from the monthly assessment under the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 at +40.2 billion rubs.", says the Minfin Communication.
Thus, the total amount of money spent on the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency is equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchases by Minfin Russia.
Every working day during that period, the CB will conclude foreign exchange purchases at organized trades of the Moscow Stock Exchange on an equal basis during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be included in the Federal Treasury account at the Central Bank.
The murder of the journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Officials of the riodos newspaper usually meet in the environment to discuss plans to highlight recent violent crimes in Sinaloa, related to organized crime, corruption of officials or the continuing war on drugs.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they have met to talk about security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children to the office where they had already dropped the grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence needed, suspicions and internal sensations would be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being held by the Government or the cartels, a whole list of supporters, leading to the threat of chaos in Mexico.
Violence does not prejudge, and among the troops that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, not less than 25 since President Enrico Pena Nueto took office in December 2012; 589 people were under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven people were killed in seven states this year.
Among the last are their publisher and inspiration, founder of Rios, Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The only big mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Waldes wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is everywhere -- a large photo of Valdes showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Rios building; two reporters in 30 years Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry his smile, face in his eyes or his corporate panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Prosecutor for the Investigation of Journalist Cases was organized in 2010, only two cases were investigated according to the Journalist Protection Committee.
As with most of the killings committed every year in drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists rarely appear before the court.
The riodos journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are killed in the heat, even though they are now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from the security talks at the meetings, Ibarra said.
"It's very foolish to spend time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On 15 May, Valdes left the riodos office in the capital of Kuliakane.
He managed only a few quarters before his red Tooth King was stopped by two men; he was taken out of the car and shot 12 times in it, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter went to his car and smashed it in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He still has a wife and two adult children.
Listening usually goes fast across the Culiacan.
But the Waldenses are almost silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and released in the U.S. in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battlefields, since rival factions are fighting to fill the established vacuum.
We won't talk about killing one or more people every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the barn is filled with beautiful two-storey drug-scene masks, which are more than the home of many living people.
Let's just forget for a minute that the state of "satisfaction" is just when one of the cartels takes control of the maritime state with important ports and ways of drug trafficking in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ishmael Bohorques, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Rios, was overwhelmed by the guilt that he could not protect another.
He thinks two mistakes have helped murder.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of a rival cartel, was published in February with Guzman's sons.
The publication could upset the sons; the people who were supposed to be members of the gang gathered all copies of the publications as soon as they were delivered to the kiosk.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after the other newspaper that wrote about the same story was seized.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a regular milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He'd been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Norway, and in 2003, together with five colleagues, he founded Rios, sold his 50 dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to deal with journalism without affecting the subject of drugs," Bohorkes said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publishing, sales, and advertising revenues.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports, not afraid of censorship, but attracted readers to what they could read in this publication about what nobody else had dared to write.
Eight years after his foundation, Rios received Maria Murs Kabo's prestigious award for the reporting work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Prize for Courage in an investigation of Mexico's drug trafficking wherever it went.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is "this form of life," he said in October last year in an interview with Rompevinto TV.
"You have to take the task that lies with you as a journalist, or you're just a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoses staff miss out on Valdes, the tunic, who screamed like a trucker in the port, another, generous on the hugs and tips, a teacher who knew how to get together in the living.
They relied on their established order.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there with the same chair.
Now they ask, "Did he lose his love for the unity of the established order?
His death led them to doubt in their calculations of how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you understand their wives, their children, their legal business and underground drug transport airports.
"These things were a damn thing," Bohorkes said.
As a result, even in the best of times, there was a high level of self-censorship and self-esteem.
We need to trust our instincts.
Stay away from the bad smell.
The problem, says the editor, "Riodoses" Andres Villareal, is that "obsession can be deceived... and then what happens to Hawaii."
The old rules, he and others, no longer operate in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft is constantly changing.
In a room where Ríodose staff gathered for security training, the second time it was prohibited to import hundreds of phones: a few days earlier, it was known that spy programs sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico to track journalists and social activists.
Two police officers are hiding in the shade of a 104-degree fire (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the Government to protect the Riodos office, which is located in a four-storey building in the Kuliakana bourgeois district.
Some reporters have asked whether these police officers are part of the 50 per cent of the order that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to the worst place, which is de facto under the control of a gang of drug dealers.
In the next issue, the Rios had three main themes.
It's a murder in Sinaloa's brother's former boxing champion Julio Sezar Chavez.
They still had government expenditures concentrated in the governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive Kuliacan restaurants in the district of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when the time came to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant while the drug dealers and authorities were at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered for the policy of the ruling institutional-revolution party (PRI), which dominated at all levels of power during almost the last century.
Recent allegations of corruption have been made against several PRI governors.
William asked journalists to write about the previous incidents at the restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo has accelerated the military.
A few more months ago, readers would have sought out the Valdez column with the most reliable information on kidnapping.
"We'd already known what happened," says 46-year-old William, for his crafty body called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office is now being used as a platform for posters and stickers with protests against the killings of journalists, because officials have become what they have never thought to be: activists on behalf of the press.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took several posters and went to the local prosecutor ' s office for the next morning.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burnt body, and the authorities said it was based on DNA tests.
Journalists all over the country have spoken louder, organized protests and written "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
The director of Bohorques was in Washington that day, seeking international support in the Valdes case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the next day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, the authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordering them to be killed for speaking the truth.
After that, she asked her not to give her any further responsibilities to clarify the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdes said many times that journalists in Mexico were "rounded" by organized crime, its partners in the government, and a different society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalist, he wrote that reporters were killing not just gangs of drug traffickers; they did so by order of security policies and services in connection with organized crime.
The Articulum 19 press committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed at the order of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, killings scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body we found a note supposed to be written by the person of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and earpieces were lying next to her head cut off.
Some publications have preferred to close as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Bricz was killed in March.
Others continue to be "El Manyana" from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Huarez made a public call to drug cartels using the editorial article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their homeland or even their country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work, and they continue to see the danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it is obvious, with a photographer Ruben Espinoz, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in a Mexican apartment three months after the flight from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance risk decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he's afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexican is burning in hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for the press, the riodoses were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when their phones called at the same time.
The series of shootings between the opposing gangs and the security forces, not far from the resort city of Masatlan, left 19 troops, as confirmed.
The war continued to spread as promised in a series of posters found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they put news on the Rios website on the mobile phone.
The next day, the first page had to be translated.
The sirens were called near, another shot in the circles.
Bohorques has seen if their security officers are ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the entire Sinaloa, the riodos staff continued his work.
"How can you think of closing up," said Bohorkes, "if on the same day that Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her on the street to report?"
Dinozar used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems like a statue, even a horrendous horror.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible substance in the size of a rhino found by a Canadian hat remained so good that experts called it “Mona Lisa among dinosaurs”.
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his skin was red and brown – and to say that he had, in some way, “the dark past”.
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the only well preserved in Tyreofor for all the history of discoveries and one of the best specimens of dinosaurs in the world”.
It is a recently discovered copy of the nodozavra, living in the middle of the lightning period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has disturbed researchers who call him “very remarkable”.
This grassy tireophor is the most well-maintained dignitary species in the history of inventions, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fancom when he worked at the Millenium mine of Sancor near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He looked at something that seemed to be different from the environment and decided to look more closely.
The excavated was sent to the Royal Tirrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, the discovery of an animal within the ground depth of 2,500 feet (1,100 kg) was carried out.
Now that all this hard work is done, the final outcome can be demonstrated.
“It’s only easy to get in touch, and you can almost believe that he’s asleep,” said the lead author Caleb Brown, a scientific officer of the Royal Tyrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“It is one of the most beautiful and well preserved specimens of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
In studying his skin, the researchers found that it was grassy, although it was covered with pancisium and recalled a walking tank, it was apparently at great risk by floating dinosaurs.
This powerful dynasar pancimer used a red-white camouflage to hide from predators and used a protective technique known as a protective decoration, which many animals today also enjoy.
This would enable him to interact more quickly with the environment and avoid encounters with the enemy, according to experts, assuming that he was caught by larger dinosaurs.
This was the age of 110 million years for the Nodozav family and was widely printed in May, and is now at the exhibition at the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
Students have already studied the animal and given him the name Borealopelta markmitcheli in honor of the museum lab Mark Mitchell, a member of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours after his digging.
The amazing safety of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of students to document the drawing and shape of the hammers and pansy plates on his body.
They found a protective decoration, a widespread method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the upper substance was darker than its lower side.
Although the protection is well spread, the opening has become unexpected, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than the size of the living animals with the protection of the eagle.
It may be assumed that this dinosaur has been so actively caught by humid dinosaurs that evolution has preferred the masking of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the modern animals with protective skroats, such as wool, silk, or bronze, are much smaller and are more available, indicating that nodozavra had to be seriously fought for survival.
“A serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur pancier shows how dangerous the Melovian dinosaurs were,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the cherries also indicates that its skin should have been red and brown.
Students continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the contents of his food tract, to find out that he was in his last trapeze.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken into the sea, where he sank and turned down the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, there was as much heat in Alberta as it was in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely spread far deeper into the drought than they are now.
“This nodozav is truly remarkable because it is fully covered by the kept skin, and at the same time it is completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original form of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it was then in the Ranan Melo period.
There is no particular need to resort to imagination in order to re-establish it, it is only easy to get involved, and it is practically possible to believe that it is a dream.”
The Melo period is an era when giant theorists, floating dinosaurs, standing on two feet, sailed to Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrant Rex, lived for millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his terrible ancestors could hunt a tyerophore.
These include acrocantosaver, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 m) long, weighing six tons.
Students whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was introduced into the sea after death and mummified into the sea.
The substance was found by Sean Fank when he worked at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum staff, this is the most well-maintained tyerophorus in the world, along with skin and pancim, and its goal, from the sea to the bone.
On average, they reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
They were characterized by two 20 - foot [2 m] blades of shoulder.
Researchers believe that this grassy tierophorus has been a difficult step in the fact that it is now Canada until the flooded river has brought it into the open sea.
But the underwater burying of the dinosaur kept his tank accurate to the smallest detail.
The stone remains of this particular specimen were so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by the buoyant pancreatic plates along the dinosava skull.
As Michael Greschko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of safety “rare as you win the lottery”.
The longer I look at it, the more devastating it seems.
Rocky residues of the skin are still covered with buoyant pancreatic plates that absorb the animal’s skull.
His right front leg stretched out along the side, with five fingers raised up on it.
I can count the candles on his desk."
Michael Saakashvili was able to enter Poland without documents
Michael Saakashvili, formerly head of Georgia, and then the Odesh region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
In doing so, he did so without supporting his identity and nationality.
About Saakashvili's arrival, a Polish publication by Telewizja Republika who posted a video on his YouTube channel.
Saakashvili took part in an event in honour of the Warsaw rebellion against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since politicians do not know Polish, even though he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through the Polish translator.
In his speech, the policy focused on Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland, as well as on Ukraine.
The fact that Ukraine's immigration service has withdrawn its nationality, the policy has been undermined by the U.S.
Just as he was able to make a transatlantic transfer without documents until he knew it.
Former U.S. Governor Mikhail Saakashvili stated that his subscription to the poll to obtain Ukraine ' s nationality had been submitted.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any polls.
The investigation period in the case of Weinziher and Olhovik extended until January
The time limit for the preliminary investigation of the successor of the company's group "Renova" by Evgenia Olhovik and the head of the energy tank "T Plus" by Boris Weinziher was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court examined the question of the extension of the house arrest indicted.
The representative of the SC at the meeting informed the decision to extend the period of preliminary investigation for the last time.
“The particular complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need for the removal and experimentation of a large number of documents, as well as the investigation of several RF entities in the territory,” the investigator said.
He added that the suspects had regularly taken the lead of the Komi.
Their total size is estimated at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Wienziher, Olkhovic, as well as former CEO of the ZAO “Complex Energy Systems”, Michael Slobodin, who led the company Wimpelk until 5 September, transferred to the senior officials of the Republic of the Commission a levy for setting the most favourable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favourable business conditions.
Weinziher and Olkhovik were detained, staged in Siktyvkar and arrested for two months, Freedom hid from the investigation and was declared a federal investigation.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Who are the streets?”
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to the depths of the soul.
Just the day after arriving in New York during a tourist trip, St. Louis's baby was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented by Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on the phone.
She got into someone's high school position.
It was said, “The police have just killed an eighteenth-year-old, and he is still lying in the middle of the street.”
Noting that no one else in the tape had posted this information, she closed her Facebook and opened a tweet.
She had a lot of user moves with no @TheePharoh.
The rapper from the Greater St. Louis, on a real-time basis, tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black-and-white eighteen-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's lifeless body, scattered across the street, where it will be located for four hours.
"It's a savage," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later in the evening she went back to the tweets that people are gathering on the Kenfield drive.
There were photographs of the signal tape and shouting people and people claiming that he was Brown's father who was crying, saying, "The Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a direct broadcast as a police officer stood before a group of protesters with a loathsome dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, "I'll kill you all, animals."
“This is a non-standard situation,” said Ferrell.
"It's not a murder like what we used to and what we can call typical.
At that point, I felt a shame.
I was angry and cried."
She took the ticket back and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she took her six - year - old daughter out of her father’s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years became the theme of the new documentary “Who Are the Streets?”, which will be screened on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, of love and loss, of strength and stamina in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, requiring answers.
While Ferrell was riding in Ferguson with his daughter, dressed in a dress in flowers and flowers, they remembered the conversation that preceded this morning a countless number of times, “the experiences of blacks and their situation”.
She said, “Do you remember what I told you about the fact that black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a cop killed an eighteenth-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't take it," said Ferrell later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of... what happened earlier.
She needs to know about it, see it, and wake up at it.
It should not only be well understood in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of the experiences of black people and their situation, and what we must do to be free to be released.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she does not personally face obvious racism, she is nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd give her a bad favor if I gave her some of that."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they first stopped at South Florissant Road, on a site on the road from the police station, which was kind of a palace camp, while the activists were waiting for reports of officer Darren Wilson's indictment.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local entrepreneur who prepared the chain package.
They picked up the packages and helped to distribute them to the Protestants.
In fact, Ferrell, in his mind, took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism has changed completely since 9 August,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and dealt with food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I had no experience with the organizer.
That's all that's happened.
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Saba Folian, one of his directors.
Folian said that she and her main operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer “just wanted to document” events.
Ferrell came to his head and said, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story you can play with?"
This skepticism has been used by many, often white people, who have come into the community to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As Folian explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not at the center of attention, and they want to do so otherwise”.
Folian had already joined his director, Damon Davis, a local artist, who was known for his activism on the subject of the death penalty.
His participation sparked sympathy for the project in Ferrell and six other locals, with whom the "Who Are the Streets" project team, supported the connection over the years after Brown's murder.
"There's no one in this documentary talking about us or with us, that's what we're talking about," Davis said.
"This was the most important thing for me as these people will be represented, because it's how I'll be presented myself."
Although the aim of the project was not to focus on the experiences of Ferrell, it was intended to show that the movement “not about the leader, but about how the community is united”, as Follian said, was the most open part of the film.
As a result, “Who are the streets?” shows unexpected personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, for example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing as she explained how she first saw the ready product.
“But I realized that when you do this and humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell's story again discusses and highlights the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the Black Life Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag in social networks after the murder of the black girl Travon Martin in 2012 – are considered homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in the leadership are supporting all this movement,” said Ferrell. “And because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black female homosexuals have to bear all this burden."
Folian agreed with this claim, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and by a multitude of homosexual black women”.
However, she insisted that “this is not a case of positive discrimination”, and that Ferrell was not selected by the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who woke up this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she turned out first, because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen."
In the meantime, Ferguson has not been a cinema camera for a long time, but there are still complex racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be at a test time for the cover during the demonstration two and a half years.
She describes the social and political atmosphere of the place, which she calls home, simply "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the word she learned when she went to Ferguson's street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
"There is nothing but our footsteps to be lost."
Two Salvadoran footballers were disqualified for the taste of US players
The footballers of El Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long disqualifications for non-sport behavior.
During the fourth final match of the Golden Cup of the North and Central American Football confederations and the Caribbean (CONCAFF) the Salvadorans tasted American toys.
The first was the defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker, Josie Altidore, and then he was stabbed to the chest.
Then, at the charge of a coal miner in his field, U.S. attorney Omar González was bitten.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with an American win of 2:0, according to Goal.com.
Similarity: The artist creates portraits with the help of DNA Chelsea Manning
At the center of the hall in Gallery Friedman in New York, people who are white, black and brown are hanging around on a provocative path, and everything is inseparably similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heiser Dewey-Harborg from the hair of the hats and cut hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent out cuts from Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst took 35 years for a well-known transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called the “Investment of the Similarity”.
This is the result of a two-year census between Dui Harborg, whose art unites technology, information and art, and Manning, a female transgender and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama softened the sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing and using the DNA computer program from Manning to create three-dimensional portraits of people with such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a deep, though difficult to perceive, not only the plasticity of DNA data, but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but when she was a teenager, openly said that she considered herself a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Act of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs were not available in prison, so only one of her photographs was known: a black and white selfie in which Manning in a platinum pot, apparently feeling uncomfortable, sat behind the car; with that picture, she began to associate.
In 2015, Dui-Harborg successfully completed its 2012 "Visit of the Unknown" project.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people by means of judicial evidence of the type of circuses and the rustic cutting, distributing DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey Hagg in a preliminary presentation to the press.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait of her DNA.
Thus, the artist and her prisoners in the museum became friends on the census and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote the comic book "Smooth Pictures", illustrated by Sholey Kanungo, who illustrated how the future President will mitigate Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book went out in the light was a pleasant surprise after seven years in the military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is opening right now, when Donald Trump announces war on people who reveal secret information in the Government, and invents new ways to burn down on Twitter the enemy he is supposed to mitigate.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this over time, she said, "there's nothing happened."
In an artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, the huge signature of Manning below (with the heart instead of "i" in her name) calls for the end of "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the other hand, its mitochondrial DNA, a long goose from C, G, and A.
With 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientificly researched artist) Dui-Harborg hoped to show how we all look amazingly, in any case, according to his biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genes do not determine what we are, how open the genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dui-Harborg; her 2007 video "False memories" is also shown here.
"DNAs can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the above-mentioned novel in comics.
The King Kong-style Manning features the United States Correctional Building with a loudspeaker in its hand.
"If they kill your word, they will win," it's written.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I'm still a skin muffin when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person - as it was visually illustrated in comics - but when she comes, she will welcome masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulations gathered, like a mob of protestors.
This is also done on purpose, as is all on display up to the height (5"2, the rise of Manning), on which the karandas drew genetic gap groups.
"I'd have hung them on the walls before, but now I wanted them to look like a bunch of people," Dewey-Harborg says about the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood behind her release."
Professor North West University and Oxford University Officer is investigating the murder charge police
According to the police, there is a national area for Professor North West University and Officer of Oxford University, who are being investigated as suspected of having been found in Chicago in an advanced number of deaths.
According to the reports of the District Court of Cook, orders were issued on Monday to detain the alleged murder without the right to be released under the charge of forty-two years old Windem Latema and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton Mr. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, Cornell Duranlo died after he had been injured by multiple knee wounds.
The warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said that the body had been found on 27 July.
The police called, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating the death of knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latham has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at the North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbag, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on the administrative leave and that he was forbidden to enter North West University campuses.
“Now it is a criminal case that investigates the officers, and the North West University is working with the consequences,” Kabbag said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have contacted the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to US investigation authorities”.
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
The Chief of Police Liaison, Chicago Anthony Gulelli, said that he strongly advised the suspect to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing,” Gulelmi said.
According to Gulelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Gulelmi, the police called the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who just received a secret message that something happened in number 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Gulemi reported that it was unclear whether the incident had occurred on 27 July.
According to him, the video camera records confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latema and the victim had relations,” Gulelmi said.
The Grand Plaza Guide has issued an address to the permanent, which reported: “The police are currently working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering a number of reasons, including possible home incident”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map soon"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) set for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Fraud Agency (RUSADA) would be met in the near future.
“The specified phase of compliance was completed, and RUSADA was entitled to plan and carry out tests together with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKD).
The WADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map to restore the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for resumption of the work of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA soon," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that the Russian Andodoping Structures should publicly acknowledge the results of the Canadian lawyer Richard McClaren's investigation of the WADA, which claimed that the doping in the Russian sport is controlled by the State.
In this regard, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there was no host program, and we won't admit what wasn't there."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smirnova, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Fraud Commission.
On the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of "Rsport" Smirnov, Smirnov admitted that there had been problems in the Russian anti-dumping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and situations.
No one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA removed RUSADA from the doping control in November 2015 following the doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-dumping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office in July, Director General of Wada Olivie Nigglia said that RUSADA was “walking in the right direction” to restore its work.
Drained fire in the 79-storey forest in Dubai
The great fire that took place in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch, which was destroyed, transmits Reuters.
It is noted that the fire has been able to cope with all fires by 4.00 per local time (3.00 msec).
Local authorities reported that no one had been affected as a result of the incident.
During the fires, the streets were covered with skyscrapers.
The reasons for this are unknown.
It has been reported earlier that in Dubai, The Torch, a 79-storey residential skyscraper, is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All the residents were temporarily evacuated.
Indiscriminate Order of the Buse of worshipers: Bruces that do not cover the truss
The scandalous leading reality show "Dom-2" by Olga Buzza defeated the spectators of the Europa Plus Live dance festival in the rabbits.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, a newly invented song with a duet with Nastey Cudri, played the song "We'll be hot."
Both girls went to the stage in the provocative "brucks" so that the lower white singers appeared.
The letters Buzova and Kudry were made on the break.
Earlier, it was reported that a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic commented on changes in the outside of Busovov.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
On Friday, 4 August, Radio 4 reported on this with a reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO's gender has also criticised Russia for the situation with Crimea and for “destabilitation in eastern Ukraine”.
However, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia would be possible and that the further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, President of the United States, Donald Trump said that the relationship between the United States and Russia was at a dangerous low level, and he accused the American Congress of that.
Ekaterinburg Metro accepts a new payment method
In October, a trip to the Ekaterinburg metro police station would be possible to pay a bank card, said OAO's "I-Net" Director Pavel Wedernikov in an interview with the "Regional newspaper".
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of travel in the subway as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, the Netherlands and Novosibirsk.
"We want people from other countries to be able to use the Metropolitan with their bank cards without buying chips and standing in line," he said.
Steps that will help your company not to become a regular Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the staff of her e-commerce start-up, but the questionnaires were not working.
The answers were often inflamed, useless, or, worse still, inconvenient.
Even though she had promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust this process.
“It was never consistent and objective,” said Errett, a manager of the 75 Madison Reed company in the field of hair care electronics.
She therefore appealed to third parties for assistance.
A new type of start-up in the field of staffing is now emerging, which helps companies to understand how their staff are feeling.
By developing and licensing software that is designed to measure the involvement of staff, they allow companies to make inquiries, to contact certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and hot lines for complaints, and in some cases to enable informants to pass the top-handling and to address the direction directly.
“We now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to monitor your health, and where is Fitbit for your company?”, says Jim Barnett, founder and President of the Glint startup in Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure the involvement of staff.
Errett explained that she had gained more understanding of what she thought and felt in three years of using Glint.
In addition to express questions and questionnaires of specific teams, the product offers a company's hot card and shows in a clear way which units have more complaints and which managers have low approval ratings, which allows it to understand why.
The companies are less aware that they need to monitor the situation at work, otherwise they will become a regular Uber, which became involved in the scandal when the former officer posted a post on a blog describing the aggressive situation in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups such as "Glint", it is a desire to control the situation - an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let’s talk about pay”, dedicated financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compliance industry can cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The "Convert" start from Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the light of Ubera's fall in reputation.
About 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla, have a Converter.
Recently, Uber appeared among clients.
Like Glint, “Convert” enables companies to send individual questions of opinion, collect confidential responses in real time and view hot maps of problem zones.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that enables staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager gets hit, the complaints go straight to the office.
“The public opinion court has taken over the authority of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of the Convercent company.
If it is found that the company is ill-treated or unethical, even if the inspector is not involved, the company may face the costly effects of client boycotts, the flow of staff and court cases, Quinlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where more than 25,000 staff are working in 500 institutions, has been using Converter for more than a year to make sure that the staff are in the course of rules and procedures, and to propose a simple way to contact the company's headquarters.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or a head office e-mail, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, Head of Legal Management of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, the problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be found and dealt with more quickly.
“I can approach a comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff members,” said Vitrano, who was led by the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
“And we protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings with staff.”
According to Quinland, companies began to take the ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002 more seriously after the accounting company Artur Andersen suffered damage due to ethical violations caused by Del Enron.
But only when “social networks received mass distribution” did companies realize that they could not keep their dirty bag from viral distribution in the network.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convert" offer their software as a service, taking with companies a regular fee for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to get the approval of the venture investors who supported the two startups.
In February “Convert” received $10 million funding from companies such as “Sapphire Ventures” and “Tola Capital”, resulting in a total of $47 million.
“Glint” received $10 million in November from “Bessemer Venture Partners”, resulting in the company's total capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising if they take into account the interlinked nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's staff expect more jobs than it used to be.
In markets with fierce competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is only a minimum.
Staff want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they are hearing them and that the work they are doing results, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQuein, a vice president on global benefits and satisfaction staff at LinkedIn, where they are also using Converter and Glint.
Investors receive income when things go well for companies from their portfolios; things go well when employees are committed and involved.
If the third party's analytical tools promise to increase the loyalty and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they are supported.
According to cultural experts in the workplace, it is important to have information on the involvement of staff.
But the data is useless until the company's supervisors take action.
In fact, if the company requests back-to-back staff, it may give the impression that the change is a matter of urgency.
And if the changes do not occur fast enough, or do not happen at all, disappointment may develop, and staff are losing interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be prepared to engage in 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Ratt, president of the Kotter International management consulting firm, who had to see companies making a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
‘Because if you do not go to the end, the servants will say, ‘Did you hear me?
You don't care?
Why should I not be equal to you?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly interviews with staff, is able to take action on the same day when someone is reporting the problem with Glint.
And, following the feedback from staff members who were inadequate in decision-making and communication quality, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to address problems.
Ruby Tuesday has received new knowledge about its staff and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help her to retain more effectively staff in the high-flowing sector.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaule, a new asphalt is hidden in the Krasnoarmaic perspective
In Barnau, cardinal measures have been taken to eliminate the causes of asphalt gaps in the Red Army perspective.
The place where the pits were created twice on a recently asphalt passage (a crossing from the Young Street) is decided to "open".
It is recalled that a small section of the road near the tramway was disrupted because the land had been planted in an unexploded, unexploded network.
According to the Vice-Chairman of the Urban Committee on Road Agriculture, Welfare, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for the detailed investigation and removal of the conditions for disruption.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
Rehabilitation and concreteization of homeless communications are expected to be required.
This is reported on the official site of the capital.
The Briins team has to take longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day.
The time is approaching the eleventh dinner; a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles is being held in custody to roll on one side of the new training fields of the campus.
Some of them walled up their football and found their back shining after the tense first day of the sports camp.
For many players, teams these minutes are a half-day break.
After three-hour training, the players will be sent back to the community to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman football centre at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday became Tuesday, the coach of the Briins Jim Mora said, "In the next three days, these boys are waiting for a mess."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on players, actually extended their working day – at least before the end of the Friday exams.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles were scheduled at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate them in and without a full schedule of players.
The side effect of the lack of two trainings per day was more than a day with one training, and Bruns is starting the camp almost weekly than last year and is conducting training during the summer school for the first time in the six seasons of the Sea in Vejade.
According to the schedule, they are required to conduct 18 trainings before 20 August, including the start of formal training for the first season against the team of the A&M University of Texas in September.
He must have said that he supported the amendment of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that another paragraph had emerged as a result of it.
"In three or four days, we'll give them this huge burden, it's a serious test," said Mora.
"And they just beat him, they work, they're remarkable guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it's really going to be great."
At the end of the camp, the University of California in Los Angeles will conduct closed training; this is not an easy task, since its fields are directly visible from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Centre, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed with football balls that have overcome a protective network behind the doors.
The Briins players must be at the hotel starting from these exits, but Mora allows for a problem to arise when rooms are released during the season.
"We'll have security," said Mora.
“This is a serious problem, and I don’t overestimate the danger, assuming that someone can take the room off, sit there and record training on the video.
If you have a training video, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and there'll be security on parking number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't be too worried about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terror in Petersburg were hospitalized
All those who suffered at the St. Petersburg subway in April were hospitalized.
This was reported in the media by Deputy Governor Anna Mityanin.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people left in the stationers, the TV Centre is passed over.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg Metropolis progressed on 3 April this year.
The bomb was shot by a terrorist death bomber named Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In criminal cases, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer, Abor Azimov, were arrested.
It is recalled that Roszupnadzor recently recommended that the Petersburg Metropolitan review of the road safety plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook enhances fact-finding in the fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send texts that are suspicious of mystifications, independent experts, and show their conclusions under original posts, the largest social network in the world, which is trying to combat so-called faecal news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible mystifications, send them for verification and possibly show the results of the check-in under the original post.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main ways in which the so-called fashion news has spread, which many believe have influenced the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.
This issue is also being debated actively in Europe after the French voters had been misled by false communications before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections, the plan to penalize social networks had been supported if they had not been quickly removed from the anti-fouling posts.
On Thursday, in a separate German-language statement, Facebook reported on the testing of a new fact-finding algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In order to see what reports are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make reasoned conclusions about what they are reading and what they are sharing,” she wrote in her blog Sarah Sue, Facebook News Manager.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "related articles" and work on other changes in the news chain to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a novel-comix: One lock in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's little castle was recorded in the Squeeze music video, and in the 1970s and 1980s he served as a port for Margaret Tettcher.
But 700 years from his comfortable place in the Buil Valley in Kent County, he watched a stormy history around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rods, a Yorkshireman with a land-of-the-art hair and a tendency to historical documents, to novel comics.
"I think it's so beautiful - to look at a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Everdian Age and tells about the families who lived in Scotland; each story illustrated one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Briani May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "Dears of Dead and Other Stories" - a collection of materials from the British Library; this project immediately moved him to the depths of the soul.
"I could only see a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in 1700 by a double agent working on jakobits," he says.
"This is his finger print."
And the letters always smell smoke, because at that time the fire was lit for enlightenment.
And in 300 years' time, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a man who has such passion for old papers, getting support from the National Fund and the English Council of Art and living in the castle for four months (I'm honest, I'm a bit stuck there) seems too good to be true.
Rods has been studying a new Victorian castle all day long, going through archives, and looking at numerous treasures of the name and ancient things -- for example, the heads of gynaecs on the walls or bottles, the centuries that have been in ruins.
He walked through the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talked to foresters, gardeners, and at times with artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and built to write."
The history of Scotty's castle is not very studied, because the National Fund had full access to it only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, the staff only started to discuss the archive that he described as "the one that the aristocrats have been down the hill for centuries".
Newspapers, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned something: "You think land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but there were two families behind that beach.
That's right, guys!"
In some stories, the castle collector becomes a starting point for wider research in English history: for example, in the "Worker", the hero is from a newly built castle to join the 1381 Christian Revolution.
“There are reports of the revolt that occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called the Kent and Sassex Riszar families,” says Rods.
"The Christian rebellion began in these places, and I thought rebellion was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other topics are closely related to the history of the castle, for example, "The Priest", in which the Jesuit priest, whose family had been hiding in Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist" about the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who was believed to have staged his own funerals by hitting the grave with stones (this was discovered several years later when the tomb was dug).
Darrella, the beloved Rods family of all who inhabited Scotty, said, "Jentalmen seem to have been jealous, they have gone into debt forever, and spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrella's men have solved their debt problems, marrying rich elderly women - I represent them as a company of nice men who are able to care for the heirs of the great estate."
After the completion of the Rods lock, there will be other opportunities for a unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in a Finnish noise, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliamiyaki, a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks choose Russia
The Russian Banks Association (ARB) conflicts: seven other credit organizations are planning to leave this public organization after Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhosbank, Binbank and FC Open.
As a result, at least 80 per cent of the market will be affected by the surplus from ARB organizations.
But this is not just a way out -- all banks that have declared a break with the ARB -- negotiate with another public institution that brings together credit institutions -- the Russian Association of Regional Banks, led by a well-known politician, Anatolio Axakov, Chairman of the Committee of the Government on the Financial Market, recognized, as a result of the last session and by the most effective leader of the mental committee and by a deputy on the number of draft laws.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was established during a discussion in the Council of the Federation, when new draft laws were being considered by the Interregional Banking Council, in particular, suggesting the reclassification of banks according to the size of the constitutional capital.
Garegin Tosunyan, President of ARB, then stated that, in the opinion of the association, the bill was adopted for the benefit of the largest banks, which thus sought to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions to take over their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, in the opinion of Tosunjan, did not always justify the withdrawal of licences from some banks, which, in truth, followed the objection of the representative of the CB: many managers of the banks that had been fined, in particular, outsideprombank, had entered the AAR governing bodies.
This exchange of views is apparently very sensitive to relations with the main bank environment regulator, and has become a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks to disagree with the ARB policy, to begin preparing for accession to the Russian Association, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB’s work is at a low level and that constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually being conducted”.
It'll be better for the investors.
What's going to happen?
Let us respond immediately to the main issue arising from a minor or conflict in or near the banking sphere: the investors will not be threatened, rather, the security of the banking system will be enhanced.
The chapter is entitled “Russian” Anatolio Axakov, known for its generosity in all the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the CB is present at the annual activities of the Association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of “regionals”.
The organizational framework clearly does not include special shocks.
There is no doubt that the ARB is facing an uncomplicated financial and management situation following the disappearance of such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, the oldest organization, established in 1991, that advocates the interest of the banking community, has little capacity to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary treatment in general.
It is not possible to say that, in the Russian Association of Extended Entities, it is ready to accept any new members, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Aksakova (“may be too much desired”), who said on 21 July at a briefing in the press centre of Parliament, that “on the next day representatives from the ARB banks asked me to consider increasing the potential of our Russian association”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is now under way, the proposals of both parties are being studied, and the special association meeting is being prepared, which will take place in Sochi in mid-September, within the framework of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll be determined.
Also, by stressing that “not to be held behind the table”, Anatoly Aksakov called a possible new leader of the updated Russian Association Georgia Luntovski, who left the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, with a high profile of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatolio Axakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to cease his vacation and arrive in Moscow for one day at the extraordinary meeting of the Russian Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the Russian Extraordinary Convention.
The entry of petrol engines into the major cities of Russia will not be limited
The deputy head of Mintrans Nikolai Asaul said that despite media reports, the entry of petrol engines into the major cities of Russia would not be limited.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept of gradually increasing the environmental class.
And there's the concept of going straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, what year has it been?
That's the same thing at the phrasing level - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
We're closing the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe this will happen," says Prime Minister.
Earlier, the Newspaper reported that by 17 August, Deputy Prime Minister Arkadia Dvorkovic had been commissioned to study the proposals for possible options for the power handling presented to the Government by PAO Director-General Kamaz Sergei Cogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of VVC cars in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for the receipt of the Green Paper.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted, which would amend the rules for the receipt of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants up to 50,000 per year, a stricter rule for obtaining temporary work visas and a restriction on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will make a significant change in how the U.S. publishes grain cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the gradual migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will benefit English-owned candidates, have money resources that allow them to maintain themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to American media.
Sex robots are real, and that should bother us.
We have not been able to think that 2017 can no longer get worse, a new report on technological success in the production of sex robots has been made.
Yeah.
Sex work is now at the center of attention.
The Responsible Robotics Fund (FRR) has recently issued a report on the development of sex work in the next 5 to 10 years.
In the opinion of Noel Sharki, a professor of robotics and artistic intelligence at the University of Cheffield and the FRR co-founder, we must take seriously their appearance.
Users can choose the color of the robots' eyes, the shape of the socks and the type of nails.
"People are laughing at it, but companies are sending it to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see them much more," Sharki said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex balls evolved from their inhaled collections in silicone-skin robots, hot - to - touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "crush" their robots at their own taste, choosing all from the color of the eye and the shape of the nails to the shape and color of the notes.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" compared to which the Stepford woman would appear to be very progressive is even more worrying.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to work on the qualities they find attractive, for example, stiffness.
There are still the sex jobs of Roxxxy Gold, developed by True Companion, which are provided with an already programmed individuality, such as the Cold Farra, which makes the impression that the Wild Wendy has a "mild" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly," says the True Companion.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She has a change of mood during the day, like this man!
She might want to sleep or chat, or she might be in a mood!"
In the emergence of sex robots, there is a lot of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships, but most of all concern the subjugated image of women, association with rape, which causes the possession of the Cold (read: opposing) Pharaoh.
"True Companion" Roxxxy compares it to the dialer, only for men.
"If there's a woman (sic!) there may be a voter, why can't a man have Roxxxy?" - says on the website.
But these sex jobs are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a deviation from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex, subjecting as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain in the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very educational about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people aren't stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them a chance to do so.
This is not the coincidence that these complex sex jobs have occurred when women's rights were threatened worldwide when there was a president in the White House, who boasted that she was suitable for women.
The most terrible thing in the Rasskas swanky teleseries is not graphic images, curved bodies and extruded eyes, which is how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem that big.
The aim of the sex robots industry is to achieve such a physical similarity to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars), which allows technology.
Their creators want them to appear to humans to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's just that your "characters" work doesn't look like women.
They can't break up with their partners or leave them.
They have neither their own life nor their biography - nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, they are ministers.
The native of Los Angeles Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been speaking for the gathering of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which starts on 31 August.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, General Manager Andrei Lebedev reported that.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come under family circumstances.
We're going to the Eurobasket without a naturalized game, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will allow for the development of our young players," he said.
I recall that with Jeter's direct participation, Ukraine took the sixth place in the 2013 Eurobasket, and for the first time joined the World Cup World Cup, on which the Yellow-Blues were unable to overcome the group stage, and the U.S. natives picked 15.4 points on average, scored 3 picks and gave 5 gears.
Jeter has stopped running for the Ukrainian assembly since his departure from the position of the chief coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
The European Year 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will carry out their team tournament matches on the Promised Land.
The Evgenian Morzina in Group B will have five units: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our husband's collection held two checkpoints, in which the Dutch and Belarusians joined.
A big exaltation of the Trump?
Imagining Mita Romney seems very reasonable
In the Trampa era, it was common to note that political disputes that led to the polarization of the American electorate broke up some families on a micro-level basis.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the U.S. newspapers were crammed into columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives who were voting for the Trump.
Looks like we're all under a lot of stress, so we're gonna be all over soon.
It's less about the Tramp's ability to unite families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-wing poet of Chicago, who had long been on a knife with Republicans in his family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity in the fight against the common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trump's White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother, with whom she had debated the ten-year policy, was suddenly and strangely on the one side.
This is certainly good for dinner, but I can't think of it as being dangerous in a broader context.
The tramp blew the force in the left flank, but the deforming effect of his control could move us all to the right.
When we're talking about Trump and "normalization", we mean the unlikely possibility that we'll stop hitting his way out.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right Republicans who will suddenly appear to be a healthy model in the light of his standards.
I realized that I was very bored today about the old-fashioned nonsense of Mitt Romney -- with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14-percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) -- compared to Trump and then, and the other seems very small.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to the carousel in the Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are terrible and huge, pictures of the glass fibers on the central drum, the thundering clowns and the animals who, when they go away, look in horror at their backs, are extremely evil, and the loud music, as it is not surprising, makes them turn away.
So many known things in this city are disappointed: the species of skyscrapers grow old, the silhouettes of the buildings have come too far to cause tremor, and the reality of the city has failed in its dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day I learned that the Swiss-Cattage area is actually not a Swiss joke (thematic pub "Ye Old Swiss Cottage" not an account) but a big circuit in North London.
And Carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, a eleven-year-old child, and two-forty-year-olds can spend excellent time.
If I could make a score, I'd put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me to.
And at the university this week, I was asked to pass a terminal card, evaluate my "experience" shopping scale from one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street, the same plus the option to conduct a 15 per cent tea assessment is for a stand-by order.
The result is not only a slowdown in the idea of interaction, but also a personal relationship to a situation that does not involve it.
The poor salesperson at the university smiled while I was constantly evaluating my experience of handing her a credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital for pain in the chest
Pistorius leaves prison for visiting a doctor the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of sinews on the locks that he had received as a result of his fall into the chamber, as the prison administration had approved.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder after the prosecution's appeal for an initial sentence for unintended murder.
He killed Steincamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting several times through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius stated that he had taken his friend for a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The Prosecutor's Office stated its intention to protest another protest, this time against the six-year period of Pretoriaus, which, she said, was too soft.
The Office of the Prosecutor-General stated that the Supreme Court of South Africa would have to appeal and the appeal would be considered this year.
Pretorious time may be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A signature of a non-departure was chosen for the suspect's beating of the NTV journalist
Civil rights defenders have chosen a measure of suppression in the form of a sign of a non-violence for a man who attacked a journalist by the TVTV TV station Nikita Razvozzeeva during a direct air raid from the Park of Goriko on 2 August.
This is reported by the TASS with reference to the official representative of the IMF RF Irina Volk.
“In the context of an investigation of the criminal case initiated under article 116 C.E. F.C. (“Poboy”) concerning a 32-year-old man who was hit by a correspondent in the Central Park of Culture and Rest, the name of the Goriko, the suspected choice of a measure of suppression in the form of a non-road and appropriate conduct,” explained Volk.
The representative of the IMF added that an administrative protocol for police non-refoulement had been drawn up with regard to the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during the direct air to VVD Day, a non-slip man came and struck on the face.
As it turned out later, holigan has no relation to VAT.
In fact, according to Razuzjaev, the desantants were trying to hold the mosquito.
Two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal tent stand
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal detention.
On 1 August, a group of people setting up tents in an unfavourable location, including two Bulgarians, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the persecution is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Bi-Ti-Vi television channel that Bulgarians were then released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control of the free camp and have already imposed serious fines on all those who are caught while staying in a place not intended for that place.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may appoint a fine.
Mid-Russia accused US Vice-President of the rhetoric of the cold war
Statements made during the U.S. Vice-President Michael Penz's European tour were criticised by the Russian Middle Ages.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly skating at primitive ideologies during the cold war, which have been completely tainted from reality,” said the Russian Foreign Office.
Thus, in the Middle Ages, Pensa responded to the words of the “Russian threat” and the attempts to cross the border that he had made in Podgorica.
The Russian MID pointed to the destructiveness of the choice of either "with the West or with Russia" and the invisibility of the fact that the whole of South-East Europe had been entered into NATO without alternative.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to expel Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another source of tension.
"We call on American colleagues to stop the harassment of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is constantly based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual interest," said the Russian MIDI statement.
Feldsher suffered in the DTP with a "fast" in Podsovski
The DTP occurred in the sub-muscle Stopino, which resulted in the collision of the anomalies with the "Quick Help" carnet, the Feldsher.
Today around 08:10 msk was hit by a Mitsubishi car with a car of immediate assistance in the city of Stupino Moscow area.
“As a result of the crash of the car, it was soon turned into a press release from the ICTY in Moscow.
At the DTP, law enforcement officers are working on the scene, and the circumstances of the case are clarified.
In the Odessa area, a woman threw her newborn son into the cellophone package.
On the evening of 3 August, the Police Department reported to the local resident that he had found a package with a child in an unconstructed private home.
“The law enforcement officers and doctors who quickly delivered the child to a medical institution have gone to the scene,” reported the National Police Chief of Odes.
The doctors found that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of a doll.
During the priority operational follow-up activities, the identity of the birthplace is 36-year-old local resident.
It has also been established that a woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of family law enforcement, the family had not been affected before and had not been given special consideration.
Police are currently setting out the circumstances and reasons that have offered the woman the opportunity to proceed, and a procedural decision will then be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of a doctor.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman threw her unfavourable child into a garbage dump in Nicosia.
Grigory Leps: "I'm fighting, although 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian Estrada Grigorio Leps will cancel his 55th anniversary on the next Sunday.
Before the feast, the singer shared with the Enlightenment Observer.
I remember your "poltico".
A special tent in the Lies, Gloria Gainor sings for the nominee, a powerful salad over the Moscow River.
You probably wondered how you'd like to spend your next five years.
Have you lost your mind?
When it comes to professionalism, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, I went through the country three times, I gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two bad albums.
Of course, now I'm not what I said 20 years ago.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Five times as I sang in my 30s, it's getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, and I think I'm going to a different level.
You're writing a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on him now.
Actually, we've already written it down in my studio, and now we're going to send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious?" on a single song written together with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't taught her yet.
We'll do it later when we get the clip on her.
And we'll present the album in November to a series of my Christmas concerts in the Moscow Crocus City Hall.
The classic American drummer Chris Coleman put his hand on your new plate.
Do you think he wanted to get into his gastro-intestinal?
In my opinion, Coleman is today one of the most outstanding drummers in the world.
He came to me at the studio, recorded his party.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects) offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they have made too much progress.
It was about the fees from €35,000 to €45,000 a month.
At that time, I thought it was in post-Soviet space to find worthy musicians.
And he found a great drummer, Max Malishev.
It is better to feed your own people.
In time, I want to talk to any of them, not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is a high-ranking player at the international level.
It's written by Western music magazines, it's invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wy, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came with another executive technique."
Your album goes to Los Angeles, American musicians work with you, but you still can't come to the United States yourself?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't go to America.
I never said I was studying there.
The more you communicate with these professionals, the more useful.
We don't give a shit about them, but we don't have that kind of experience, schools.
Before our performers of popular music for 70 years, the challenges that American musicians have always solved have not been fully addressed.
They were striving for the highest quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now why did Britain refuse to come into my office for ten years?
But every year, I'm going to submit visa papers to the British Embassy to allow me to go back there and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a funeral, but an office, right?
Yeah, Monte Carlo's got a good sports hall, I used to talk there once.
They have now been invited again, and, as far as I know, all tickets to the concert have already been sold.
"Randevo Lyme Wycule" which will start in Yurmala on July 20th, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lima is a remarkable singer and beautiful woman who is able to give herself a beautiful ring and even a whisper.
After the gastrollies and the Christmas concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the creation of Vladimir High.
You already have two albums with his songs in the discography.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to write about 80-90 songs of the Highness about in the same feed as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'm going to have our famous musician, Timor Wedernikov.
I'm trying to get involved in the album and Alexander Jakovlevic Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see how it works.
You and Boris Grebenškov songs gradually entered your repertoire.
Maybe you'll write it down later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a wonderful musician.
I cut myself off with him a few times and asked, "Can I sing that song?
He said, "Grygory, I'm writing songs for them to be fulfilled."
Please try it, come on.
It's probably interesting to write that album.
As long as I don't have a job like that, but in the future, in two years' time, if Boris Borisovich won't object, I might be doing this project.
If you do not concentrate fully on your business centre.
I don't think you've signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I would have dreamed of having under my wing, but they are self-contained, people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Serena is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his development strategy.
And in my center now there's Alexander Panyatov, whom I took to Golos.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such songs are rare.
It'll be a real shame if he doesn't reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to improve his repertoire, I'm taking pictures.
I hope for a good outcome.
I'm also trying to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I pay for poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not achieve great heights, I will nevertheless lead our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a written album on their way, a few videos.
And further, if they want, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they get the money back.
Although I'd be pleased if any of them were to gain commercial success and pay me the percentages we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover the oxygen for anyone.
Let everyone work, break, prove how I once proved.
If you're invited to take a gastro-tour in Ukraine tomorrow and they guarantee entry to the country, will you come?
I'm still being invited there.
The main focus is on closed activities.
And as for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, who, in his own conviction, flew to Syria on the same plane that was then destroyed.
If you say tomorrow that you have to fly to some other point for the sake of the State, I'll take it.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I'm very sorry that we've had such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we're supposed to be together.
I'm sorry that this is not going to happen, at least in the near future.
And I used to give 40-50 concerts in Ukraine a year ago.
They've met nowhere.
Thank you very much.
And he cooperated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, St. Lobodo, Artem Loika...
In Ukraine, the masses of donated people, and sincerely regret that they cannot now fully tap their talent into a broad Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would be pleased to invite a classic Ukrainian executive to Russia, such as Slavou Wakarchuka, and have a joint concert with him.
But, I think at this point, it's unlikely...
Andreia Ochlopkova was dropped with a cosmodroma
As it became known, the Technical Director of the Cosmodrom East Andrey Ochlopkov started working at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HCNPC) called Hruniceva.
He had previously been de facto in the construction of the Eastern Cosmodrom, but because of differences with the management of the Centre for Land and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), he was transferred to the company in the Moscow Files, where he was coordinating production.
Mr. Ochlopkov will not be replaced: the position of the technical director is likely to be abolished and the function is disbanded by the CENCI units.
The fact that the Technical Director of the East and Deputy Director of CENCI for Technology Development Andrei Ochlopkov has gone to work on HCNPC on behalf of Hrunicev, "U" has told the top managers of several space industry companies, as well as government staff.
"He's been working on a new job for a few weeks," said the U-sitters in the industry.
The CENCI's operational comment was not received on Thursday, and Mr. Ochlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information “U” was formally confirmed in the CCCTB.
He decided to move to the position of Director for Production Coordination, said to the companies. - Andrey Ochlopkov, the task of providing a minimum start for the first launch on the east coast, was fully implemented.
Mr. Ochlopkov went to work at CENCI in 2013, with his shoulders in space troops, in particular in Baiconoura, and in Plezecke, at the "north" cosmodrom, he served as the First Deputy Commander of Colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Ochlopkov became a criminal figure.
The prosecution accused him of being kidnapped: it was reported that the regional traders had received bribes from him, but had failed to fulfil the commitments made to clean separate parts of the missile carrier in the Archangel region and the Republic of the Congo.
In 2012, the jury recognized him as innocent.
The CENCI's responsibilities for technological development were extended to various projects, but the main project was the construction of a cosmodrom in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency Oleg Ostapenko directly said that the situation in the East was "critical already in October 2013".
The issue was that there was a strategic error in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Union-2.1 carrier missile was planned at the same time as at the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, the completion of the building was decided a half year earlier and the deadlines were set from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, there was a need for skill: CENCI specialists started parallel installation of technology equipment on unencumbered facilities.
Andrey Ochlopkov was the main proponent of this idea.
Despite the existing risks and still the transfer (as opposed to December 2015, the Union flew only on 28 April 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source "U" on the cosmodrome: " Otherwise we would not have made any leaks from the East until now, but we would have done the construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who was driving the construction of a cosmodrom, called Andrea Ochlopkova his "space Susanny", but he almost always asked for information about the construction process.
He recalled Mr. Ochlopkov's point of view: for example, in the "U" interview, he suggested that the Federal Special Building Agency (Specster) be deprived of the status of the sole executive in the East and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we keep all eggs in one box of Specstria?"
This idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the contractor-general to allow the construction and assembly work to be completed at the start and technical complex planned for the fourth quarter.
According to "U", Mr. Ochlopkova's new place of work had become a source of disagreement with the CENCI leadership on how to complete the construction and construction of the cosmodroma complex, as well as working methods with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be best for all," said one of the top managers involved in the East.
The official of the Government apparatus, in turn, calls it a strange decision: "He was one of the best specialists, finding equal replacements would not be easy."
According to "U", this will not be required: the post of technical director of the cosmodroma will be abolished and its functions will be disbanded by CENCI units.
A two-special education programme will be held in music schools
In the future, students of children’s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Director of the Department of Science and Education, St. Nicholas Goubenko's Minkultura, repeated disciplines can be re-readed to students, and the issue of the payment of the remaining second-grading training to be decided by special grants is referred to the RIA News.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we, together with the expert community, are developing a mechanism that will allow two specialties to be adopted, but will not be contrary to the existing legislation in the field of education," Goubenko said.
Last Friday, during the Sunday Talk, Vladimir Putin, a student of the Sirius Children's Centre, told the student, Maria Andreywa, that he had to pay the repeated items for the second specialty in the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me she was studying the violin class and fortepiano and has awards in both directions.
The Head of State recognized its question very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russians were arrested on the wall.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who is on the wall on the roof of the high building, reports the El Universal portal.
The incident occurred in Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, went through a three-foot landing on the territory of Nestle's office building complex and took himself to one of his pools.
However, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and rope.
The young man was already on the roof.
Staff of the Ministry of Public Security landed him on the ground in a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
There they ascertain whether a young man is lawfully present in the territory of the country.
In the meantime, a video with a young high - ranking man has become popular in the Network.
The users called the young man a spider.
As media reports, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolates can help to facilitate CPC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your diet.
But recent studies say that diet, rich in meat proteins and dairy products, can help relieve symptoms in those who suffer from infectious diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leads to quail and exhaustion of life, chronic or bloody pride, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, symptoms are recommended to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acids of triptophan contribute to the production of immune cells that increase the suction tolerance.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the bladder are monitoring harmful microbes from food to body.
Cells capable of starting a fire process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body, and thus do not harm sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severe to the side of the fire, it can lead to inflammatory diseases of the bladder.
Experiments have shown that a mouse with a specific bacteria in the pocket shows an increase in cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs a triptophan, one of the building elements of the protein, to start these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal microbial of the bladder, and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptophans were fed in the mouse, the more these immune cells had."
He assumed that the same would work for people: the combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptophan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation of the environment in the basin.
Dr. Luis Servantes-Barraganavas' post, studying the variety of immune cells that increase the tolerance, found that one group of mice had these cells and another group that belonged to the same line but contained them separately did not have them.
She assumed that the difference could be caused by the microbial of the mouse, by the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the stomach and bladder tract.
The cell DNA of the mouse was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in mice that did not have them.
Mouses grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbial and that did not develop this type of immune cell received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have grown L. reuteri into a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of the fluid - without bacteria - to the undeveloped immune cells that are derived from the mouse.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a side-effect of the treatment of triptaphane, known as indole-3-moleic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophans in the mouse, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptophans was reduced twice, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerability of the cell as they do in the mouse, and most of us have L. reuteri in their pelvic tract.
It is not known whether the side products of L. reuteri triptophane contribute to the development of cells in people like the mouse, but in people suffering from inflammatory diseases of the bladder, defects in the genes associated with triptophane have been detected.
She said, "We may have to strengthen the development of these cells, because these cells depend on the internal surface of the oxygen.
High levels of triptophan with L. reuteri may potentially lead to increased population."
In the opinion of José Mourinou, Manchester United hired genius in the face of the German Matic
Manchester United has hired genius in the face of Nemjani Matića, Joze Mourinju, after the semi-defender debuted in the match against "Samporai" on Wednesday evening.
The game, acquired for 40 million pounds at Chelsea, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match United in front of a UEFA Supercoub against Real Madrid on Thursday, and impressed the role of a semi-defenser, while the players of the Polly Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke in front of them when they were blessed.
However, since Mattic did not take part in the pre-season Chelsea tour in Asia, he did not take the preparations for the game seriously, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Maurinju, required further preparation before the beginning of the prime league season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius, is what he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourin said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner than late."
Just like Matic, his new friends Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukaku started playing at the Aviva stadium when Maurinju began to form its main part before the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Maurinu wanted to hire three more players, but argued that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire in the first place.
"I am grateful to the club for having won three out of four," he added.
"I am even more pleased if they get me four of the four, but they've already made a lot of effort for me."
Former Lithuanian Social Democrats' Leaders Condemn them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Democratic Socialist Party of Lithuania, former Prime Minister Algirdas Butkijicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Social Democrats Speaker Cheslovas Yurshenas, urged the parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the Parliament's newspaper reported, because of training with partners - the Union of the Crescents and the Greens - a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic Party, whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are three senior experienced associates with open letter, which states, inter alia: “The constant disappointment of the election party, but the coalition with the “Christians” has created for us not very easy, but also the conditions for further implementation of the social justice goals that are set out in the Government programme, and for maintaining the political domination of the left-wing centre over the right parties on our initiative.”
According to the party's former leaders, the discussion has so far “belonged to the emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments”.
The authors are afraid that the unmistakable actions of their party can lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
A fine was imposed on the disabled, Anton Mamayev.
Mosgorsud has eased the punishment of disabled rider Anton Mamayev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand.
Earlier, the decision of the Timorese Court was released from SIZO.
Mosgorsud confirmed, however, that the accused was a criminal, since he had organized the killing and kidnapping of the former expert.
Mosgorsud, in his decision, relieved Anton Mamayev's punishment of up to 200 grand.
“Mamaev is an organizer of the fight, which also constitutes a crime, and should therefore be charged with criminal responsibility,” explained the “U” press secretary, Mosgorsud Uljan Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account the health status of Mamáeva, the factual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied article 64 of the FMR, which stipulates that a lower sentence may be imposed.
With regard to Assistant Mamaev Vasilija Serostanov, the Court did not establish circumstances that would give rise to a change in the severity of the sentence and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mammaev himself stated that he was not satisfied with Mosgorsud's decision.
I'm disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be a justification for continuing to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not rule out appeals against a sentence in the Mosgorsud cassation court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the cases to the European Court of Human Rights," he said.
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev Moscow, who suffered from spinal atrophy, was a criminal figure last autumn.
The invalid claims to have bought a motorroller in a known $160,000 to sell later.
However, the owners of the motorcycle, including the former fighter, said that the disabled person and his assistant Vasili Seroštani had chosen property from them, threatening to resort to violence.
On 30 June, the Timor-Leste District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasilia Serostanov to three years in a colony, and Anton Mamaeva to four and a half years in prison with a penalty in a general regime colony (art. 162 C.E.).
After the disabled had been placed in the SISO, the General Chamber, the Genprocuratura, authorized for human rights, joined the case with President Tatian Moskalkov.
As a result, Anton Mamaev was released from SISO in mid-July by the same decision of the Timorese Court.
The defence, in turn, appealed to the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
UNF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The “Forum of Action” of the General People's Front (UNF) will address environmental issues in 2017, reported to the “Reports” source in the UNF and confirmed the head of Alexie Anisimov's e-mail movement.
According to him, the Frontoviki Forum plans to prepare a report to the President on domestic environmental issues and to propose a strategy for their decision.
The briefings at the UNF noted that the report of the head of State would contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the Statements, the final forum of the UNF will be autumn.
Its exact date has not yet been determined - usually under the President ' s schedule, which is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present in the key activities of the UNF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts, in Rostové-na-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatiya Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be put forward in these activities, we will also make systematic proposals to address environmental problems, as told by the UNF ' s "Reports " .
The Co-Chair of the Central Staff of the Movement, Olga Timofheeva, led by the Committee on Environmental and Environmental Opinions, reported that the “frontoviks” would report to the head of State on the work carried out during the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The outcome of the environmental forum and the UNF Forum of Action are likely to be brought together.
Over the year, we have grown a strong team of environmental experts, seen gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be in the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition, the “frontows” are also reported on the priority projects of the UNF,” said Olga Timofheev.
She said that the forum would also be invited by a special representative of the head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov.
He had previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months later, the Year of Ecology will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To prevent these issues from getting out of the agenda, she added, “Old Timothy. ”
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute of Social Research (ICEI) Andrei Kolyadin noted: In raising the environmental issue, the UNF is acting as a member of the presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts at various forums, and these initiatives received the President's support, said "Investment" to Andrei Kolyadin.
He stressed that, to date, the economic capacity of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded, which could give regions additional impetus to development.
Further, with the help of the IMF, the regions will be able to overcome not only their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The current nature of environmental issues demonstrated the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the garbage dump in Balashhe (now closed) and about the coal dust in the port of Naduk (a draft law on the prohibition of open coal spills in human settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timofheev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal basis for addressing environmental problems in Russia has been established as a whole, the issue is further law enforcement and the position of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is considered to be the head of the Ecology for All Fund Leonid Bochin.
A member of the SPC, the head of the NGO Greens Russia Sergey Chiplenkov, in talking to the "Reports", stressed that a responsible approach to society and business is needed to deal successfully with environmental problems, and some legislative efforts are limited.
As soon as society and business are aware that environmental problems are a much more strategic step forward, the situation will change, Sergei Chiplenkov noted.
The expert stressed that the tendency to violate environmental legislation had to be a cost-effective solution for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the hand-to-hand machine
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip set up so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office, and even drive a car with a simple handkerchief.
Steven Nortem, a 30-year-old, has used a cross-sectional chip between large and indicative fingers and now, through his BioTec, offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their life for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Queen in Winchester, in order to ensure that the procedure for use was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology looks like a microchip that uses cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The company Nortema also replaces locks in houses and cars with a price-matched chip of 300 pounds per lock.
One child's wife's father has already set up a technology in his home and in his vehicle "BMW Z4", which is being carried when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House's requirement for taxpayers in thousands of dollars
According to the reports of the armed forces provided by the magazine TIME, the White House's decision last month to push the seabed helicopter to the South Bank for an event dedicated to American industrial production was $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the “Marine One”, when the board is the president, has become the central element of the event held in the White House on 17 July, which demonstrated American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens and senior officials of the White House have examined technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was displayed near a yacht from the state of Man, a fire car from Wisconsin and a truck driver from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadrel (HMX-1), the division responsible for helicopter management, the Military Office of the White House ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the Southern Hemisphere in the case of “unusual” activities.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you were in the course, because this is an unusually wide-ranging event in the press,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his chief, the first deputy commander of the Marine Corps Air Force, before the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Bank about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend the 3rd day event, and would remain there until the gas would be released between 6 and 9 evenings on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second flight crew will be required in accordance with working hours restrictions.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the operation, and the security officers stayed close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It remained unclear whether the second team had been required to produce the reports received from the TIME magazine.
The Act of Hetcha prohibits federal servants from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the event is contrary to this decision.
“We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were asked not to do so,” the commander wrote.
"It looks like you're not going anywhere," said the deputy chief.
The event “Sedelano in America” was declared by the White House as an official event, and the Hetcha Law did not apply to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
During the course of the event, the President made efforts to promote the health reform that was then being developed in the Senate and praised efforts to regulate government decisions.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask them only for the possibility of a photo is unusual.
Trump has already been the subject of discussions in February, when the President's plane went on its backstage during his first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his account on Twitter is filled with complaints about his predecessor's use of the President's plane.
“A white house with a sparkle from the show “Sedelano in America”, where 50-state products made by American workers from American materials were presented,” said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 crews often operate training flights around Washington and the South Bank to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House exactly before the dive.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 performed 58 training sessions at the White House.
According to one official, a flight carried out for the activities “Sdelano in America” was scheduled for the necessary training flights per month.
The unit’s helicopters also spent 11 additional hours that day as part of “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibitors present at the event.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not taken part in the organisation of the helicopter demonstration in the South Bank.
HMX-1 does not take the budget into account in the presidential field, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
However, according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the refund rate for the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 during the flight.
The unit records that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes on each side of its airport based on the Quantico Marine Corps in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual value of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“To calculate the value of taxpayers based on the reference rate of reimbursement is quite wrong,” Walters says.
“These exemplary rates include personal composition, servicing and many other irreversible costs included in annual allocations”.
According to the 2015 REND study, reimbursement rates do not include the value of the personal composition, but indeed take into account the value of the fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At that time, the former White House Press Secretary, Sean Spyser, spoke for the protection of the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show this week things done in America," said Spyser.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are hundreds, if not thousands of people, whose job depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military technology over which so many Americans have been constantly working.
It is therefore appropriate, of course, to draw that attention.”
It was unclear whether Trump was working with the helicopter, watching the South Pole during the event, but he was sitting right in the driver ' s seat in the fire truck.
Within the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky's representatives with a press release on his own product fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three of them."
Moscow will allocate grants for city hospital rehabilitation offices
Every year, the Save Life Grants will be awarded to city hospital rehabilitation and intensive care facilities.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobjanin, visited the City Hospital of Judah.
During the clinic review, he handed a thank - you letter to the orthopaedic doctor, Victor Procco, who led the most difficult operation to rebuild the adolescent stage.
Sergei Sobianin also told about the decision to award annual grants to city clinics for intensive treatment.
The funds will be directed towards the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor, the hospital name Judin is today one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, a new modern equipment has been introduced to the clinic to enable doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Colomen Village Hospital.
There are now more than a thousand patients in the medical office.
In addition to resuscitation and stationery, there are day offices here.
The state of the hospital has 2,800 staff.
The total area of the hospital is 23.7 ha.
In February of the current year, the mediation was part of the pilot project to organize short-term accommodation stations (SCPs).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
In surgery, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce patient rehabilitation.
After the operation in the station, they spend only a few hours.
Only during the first half of the year in the clinical hospital, Judin was hospitalized for 36,000 patients.
The clinical staff carried out 15800 operations at different levels of complexity.
NGO reported the lack of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbanka
In Nzbanke Ukraine (NBU), there were reports of no applications for purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
On Friday, 4 August, the TASS reports on this subject with reference to the representative of the NGO press service.
NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopani, to harmonize the acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares via Parjetbank, has been withdrawn.
"There were no documents from other potential investors for the purchase of shares of Sberbank in NBU," the communication noted.
On 3 August, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokoppenja withdrew an application for the purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary structure.
On 28 July, it became known that Nitzbank Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Sayid Guceriev and Grígorio Gusselnik to acquire the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision that businessmen had not provided the necessary documents to verify compliance with Ukraine ' s legislation.
Sberbank reported on the sale of its Ukrainian daughter to Norvik Banka and the private company of Belarus in March of the current year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev.
Penalties against the daughter of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they were prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country for the benefit of maternal organizations.
Narco third season trailer: In a popular series of Netflix studios after the death of Pablo Escobara, the cartel Kali plays a central role
Despite the discovery of Pablo Escobar's killer identity in the second Narco season, the Netflix studio series is far from complete.
The traffic service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are planned, and the third has already been presented by the first trailer demonstrating the crime of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the Agency's attention to drug control attracted the wealthiest drug dealer organization, the Kali cartel.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, said in the UN.
Elections may be representative only when all members of society, including women, have participated in them, said on Wednesday, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.
According to Nicolas Haysom, who is the head of the UN mission to assist Afghanistan, hundreds of women are embroiled in the provincial councils, three women are fighting for the Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of the re-registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included at all stages of the electoral process.
The elections in the provincial councils and the presidential elections will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban has threatened to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from war operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's elections, power for the first time moves peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Hays said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, a total of 3.6 million registered voters were women.
The Office of the Public Prosecutor has approved the indictment in the case of Nikita White
The Russian Attorney General ' s Office approved a criminal conviction against the former Governor of the Kyrgyz area of Nikita White, accused of having received a large bribe.

Materials were transferred to the Moscow District Court for substantive consideration.
In Venice, tourist fines have been tightened for unpleasant behaviour
The Venetian authorities have tightened the charges for bathing in channels from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in the bathroom or with heavy torso, 200 euros will now be fined.
For 100 euros, it will require those who build a picnic in a public place or ride on a pedestrian bike, transfer the TACS with reference to the Russian Tourist Association.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities impose a fine for inscriptions on the registers of 400 euros and for garbage of 25 euros.
To inform tourists about the need for compliance with the rules of conduct in Venice will be provided by the special company Enjoy, respect Venice in social networks, as well as through announcements and posters on the city council website, billboards and the most expensive places of the visitors.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the travel adviser to Venice Paula Mar, the fines will be transmitted to the conscription of the country of origin in order to warn their fellow citizens of such errors.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she noted.
In April, the Italian City Administration reported plans to limit the drought.
In Venice, the number of tourists visiting the city centre has already been limited.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to attend the Festa del Redendere festival, only 60,000 guests were allowed to attend.
In addition, moratorium has been introduced on the historic part of Venice's new icebergs and fast-food restaurants.
In the first half of 2017, officials of the State Border Service detained 272 illegals on the border with EU countries; all 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This has been reported to the House of Lords.

FP released Lakes from the post of Head of Committee
The Council of the Federation endorsed the statement by the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Lakes, on Wednesday, and released him from the post.
He remains a senator from the Habarovski border.
A statement requesting his release from the occupying post of Lakes had been written last week.
He explained his decision on the necessity of rotation and his desire to “change the pace of life”.
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave was not a minor one.
Victor Ozerov since 1996 is represented by the Habarrow County Legislative Assembly in the RFF.
The Senator has been chaired by the Defence and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheap for both the inhabitants and the manufacturers of the Buratia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Burma (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers have begun to bear fruit.
From 1 September to 25 per cent, the value of electricity is reduced in low voltage to industrial customers.
The Federal Anti-monopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the RF Government ' s Decision on changes to the General Market for Electricity and Power Regulation and the consolidated forecast balance of production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the Russian Single Energy System for the subjects of the Russian Federation (since 17.07.2017, No. 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial users of the Republic of Burma.
As a result, the cost of electricity for storm-producer producers is reduced by four, making life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and for individual entrepreneurs significantly easier.
For decades the leaders of the republics have had the thresholds of the Moscow Cabinets attempting to equal the region in tariffs from the neighbouring Irkutsk area with the waterfall of hydroelectric plants in Angara, which is from Baikal, the main water-saving territory for which Burratia is.
And only this year the movement began.
In March, the electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic decreased from 4.24 rub/kWh to 3.93 rub/kWh, or by 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of the Federal Government decision on the List of Prices Areas of the Optical Market, for which the features of the operation of the optical and differential markets have been established by industrial consumers.
In the opinion of analysts, this is only the beginning, as the Irish population pays for the kilowatt/hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to call at least the approximate date of the new tariff movement towards the decline in Burati.

National Trade Union of Unqualified, Municipal and Qualified Workers (GMB) is concerned about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer in connection with its long-term obligation to produce the plant in Glasgo.
The Scottish GMB reports that the company has been silent on the issue of future investments in the tolcross facility.
More than 500 people are working at the manufacturing plant, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, reports that over the last few years, it has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility.
The company adds that in the case of any changes to the site, the staff and representatives of the trade union “are the first to know about them”.
In a letter to the head of the company, the Scottish GMB requested McVitie's reactions to concern that funding would not be allowed to modernize production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “Our trade union members are deeply concerned that we cannot be clear from the head of the facility on business needs and investment plan for the future of Tolcross”.
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of large workers in local society and in the territory of the Great Glacier; this is an essential pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social depravation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in front of Brexit, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic decline of production, East-End Glasgo desperately needs to flourish production at McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The Tolcrosian Guide only received a letter yesterday from the Scottish GMB office, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the staff and representatives of the trade union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolcross, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We have talked to staff about how all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate are constantly reviewing our actions – and this concerns all of our facilities and activities – in order to remain competitive.
“In recent years we have invested over 5 million pounds in our tolcross facility, especially in production lines and improved functional indicators.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a productive object, and in the case of any changes in the work of the staff and representatives of the trade union, the first will be aware of this.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give direction to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petroleum Company (WNHC) should be connected to Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but the Gazproma guidelines, as well as Rosnefti, would not be given to anyone.
Thus, Russia's President Vladimir Putin responded to Igori Sechin's request to contribute to the resolution of the contradictions.
The Head of State pointed out that relations between Rosneft and Gasprom should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
The earlier chapter of Rosnefti, Igorj Sechin, at the meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gasprom on gas for HNWC threatened the project.
He noted that the dialogue with Gasprom on this issue continued.
Gasprom suggests finding gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have such resources," Secin added.
Recall that Rosneft requested permission to use it for the "East Petroleum Company" gas from the Kyrin's Gazproma residence, located on the Shelf Sahalin.
In June, Gasprom stated that negotiations on this issue continue, and “there are no sharp corners.”
Did the Barcelona PSU warn of the transfer of Neimar three years ago?
The participant La Ligi may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
“Pari St. German” will not stop chasing Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record of the three years ago?
The sensational proposal brought about a more summer transfer window when Club League 1 was ready to beat a world record at the expense of the transition, more than twice as much as a previous note related to the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United in the last 89 million pounds season.
When the transition is over, Naymar will become the most expensive game in the world, as well as the most highly paid professional sportsman in the world, since the PSG offers him over 500,000 pounds a week.
It is well known that Barcelona and the anger of the proposal and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the management of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the game since its transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world a warning about this possibility three years ago by the president of the PZW?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the rental of Blasa Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that wanted to change one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll fight them, we'll make proposals to their players," Al-Helaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to cheat one of our players, they are waiting for the consequences.”
According to all, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club expressed interest in the semi-defense from the PZZ Mark Verratti earlier this summer.
“PES” indicated that it would not release the Italian collection game under any conditions, and now it is likely that Barcelona will feel the consequences of its proposal in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Nimara.

Putin first let a few boys out of the bag.
Then he went down for a special rickshaw on the cover of the container and released the others.
Also, during the trip, the leader ordered a meeting with the environment in Baikal and to build a road on the island of Olhon.

In Russia, there will be two new areas of economic and social development -- 'Abaza' and 'Novotroick'.
The relevant decisions of the RF Government will enter into force today, 4 August.
Limits and economic activities of the TOR in the territory of the city of Abbas in the Republic of Hackas are defined.
In the city where 15,000 people live, there will be a special legal regime for business activities, as well as a minimum amount of capital investment for residents, a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
It is expected that this will bring about 2.5 billion rubles of investment in the city and that more than 600 new jobs will be created.
The list of economic activities in which TOR “Abaza” will operate a special legal regime for business activities, such as plant management, livestock production, food production, non-alcoholic beverages and clothing.
The Government of the Republic has already signed framework agreements on 8 investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the dependence of the territory on the grading company, the Abakan mine.
In January 2017, the region's authorities reported that Hacksia has fulfilled all the conditions of the Minéonomérature for the establishment of TOR.
Similarly, the authorities of the Orenburg area have been involved.
There, the city of Novotroick will also establish a territory for economic and social development.
This will diversify the economy of the monotype, reduce its dependence on the state-of-the-art "Ural steel " and create more than 2.3 thousand jobs and attract more than 8 billion rubles investment.
The list of economic activities in which the new TOR will operate a special legal regime for entrepreneurs includes, inter alia, fresh-water fishing, the production of feed, medicinal products and medical supplies.
Novotroick was the first of the Monotypes in the Orenburg region to receive TOR status.
Let me recall that the hurdle of development is an economic zone with favourable tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges created to attract investment in the improvement of the lives of the population.
Among the benefits for TOR residents are the following: income tax not more than 5 per cent for the first five years and not less than 10 per cent for the next five years, social contributions of 7.6% for the 10 years, the use of the free customs zone, the preferential access regime for the various infrastructures, and the rental rates.
