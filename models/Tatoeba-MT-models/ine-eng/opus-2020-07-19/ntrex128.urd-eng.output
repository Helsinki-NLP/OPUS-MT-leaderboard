Welsh AMs is worried about 'looking like fools'.
Some AMs suggest that their speech should be changed to MWPs (wills parliament's maintenance)
This was caused by the change of the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
In all political terms, the AMs are concerned that it could be the reason why they're here.
One book AM said that their group is worried that his voice matches Twp and Pwp.
To the outside of Wales for Quarryin: in Wales, towp means crazy and pwp means dog.
One of them said that their group is generally "not happy" and suggested a replacement.
A Welsh Constroitio said that his group has "open mind" about the change of name, but he said that MWP has a short language gap between a person's language and language.
In this area, Welsh letter W is similar to the English letter from Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a legal issue for the change of name, said: "Any speech that is to be addressed to the Arakin of the Arakin is probably the final decision of the Arakin itself.
Wills Government Act 2017 authorized Wills Assembly to change its name
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals, in which the Assembly was shown broad support for the billing of Welsh Parliament.
With regard to AMs' speech, the Commission has supported the WMPs of the Welsh Parliament, but MWP has received the most support in public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing replacement options, but getting to a random opinion for Alan Jones may be a headache, which is expected to raise legal issues about changes within weeks.
There are other changes to the way the Assembly works on the reform process, including codes on the design of AMs's inefficiency and comitology system.
During the debate on AMs' rule of law, the issue of which they should be invited to speak will be over.
Macedonia will vote in the referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will vote to change their country's name to "The Common East".
Public opinion has been designed to resolve the settlement that has been going on for decades with the neighboring country of Greece, which has been known as the Mammonia.
So he insists for a long time that his northern neighbor's name makes a claim to his letter, and he repeatedly refused to stop him in E and Networks.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, who opposes the change of name, said they would ignore it.
However, the Hammen of the Refendm, including Major Major Zeif, have argued that the name change is only a cost to the EU and the network.
St. Martin’s hours have been quieted when the Grange Houses in Hurlem faced difficulties
Mr. Adams told me that whenever I spoke to the old people in history, he said there was a house in every corner once and for all.
Not two of them today.
They said, "It is a great idea to be missing."
It's been a different way to meet people.
Bars no longer sit in places where people were regularly watching
As far as the houses are concerned, they are concerned that the money from the sale will not last longer, as the prisoners expect, and they will stand where they went.
They also said that Grange can take apartment buildings that will be filled with people who won't help the rest of the area.
They said, "The great majority of the people who buy the candominam in these buildings will be of great benefit to the people of the candominam, and they will be working hard to stop them, because it is unlikely that those who move to the candominam will be the residents of the candominam."
Both of these were built by the white tribes before they became a black metropolis of the House of Harlem, after a decade of St. Martin's Metropolitan Comunity in 1870.
The original white pheasant methodist group was copied in the 1930s.
The building was named after a black pop group that was close to worshiping.
A black-headed group led by Red John Howard Dinson took over Saint Martin and led the Beikat on the 125th road to complete and fight against black-and-growth sales on Harlem's main business street.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but when the church council members of Father Gensen planned to build it, they received services from Caroline.
The son of Father Genson and his successor to St. Martin, Richard David Gensen, with the discovery, called Caroline "the hours of strangers."
In July, an expert who performed Caroline told him something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an impossible change of history."
Professor Tfini of the University of Mechanical noted that it was the first Caroline to be performed by a black band by Music Director Downsio A Land, who moved 18 years ago to the Rio Side Gregory home.
Mr. Weather said that Saint Martin didn't change it.
What's going on in Saint Martin a few months ago is a complicated story of architects and architects, some of whom were brought to the Church by the common leaders and other scholars.
In July, the administrative agency of Paris, which is in charge of the general government, expressed fears in writing about the involvement of the clergy in July that the involvement of the architects and the contractors who sent it would put the expenses rising on the building, although they were not equipped to meet them.
Some of the officers complained about the connection.
Shrek injured 13-year-old pregnant woman for Djinga fish in California
Officials reported that on the first day of the week, the Shark Fish attacked a 13-year-old boy when he was swimming to catch the Djinga fish in California.
This attack occurred near the bank at Insanitas in the middle of the morning at 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hemel told the KSWB-TV in Digo that he was pouring out with friends for about half an hour when he heard a boy running to help, and he helped a group to get him out of the water.
Helm said that before he thought he was happy to catch the fish, but then he felt he was going to kill me.
Something's cut me.
Hemmel said that when he went to the boy, he saw that his entire bones were opened.
Hemmel said he told everyone to leave the water and said that the water had a shark.
The boy was taken to a radio station in Digo by a helicopter where he is reported to be dangerous.
I don't know the attacker's name.
Life Guard Captain Larry Wales reported during a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was designated that it was not a dangerous type of shark.
Gales added that the boy's superiors have been injured.
The promises for research and security purposes have closed access in Kasablade from the centre of the Pontou to the rest of the market in the sanitas.
Wales reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but are not considered more dangerous.
Create a British Synzebray to join a beautiful market
With the work of Sensbray Spalistot Maunin, the departmental staff is presenting the works of Bots, Superdards and Debn Hams.
Make the UK 2.8 billion pound's wealth a beautiful market, which is still growing while the sale of façade and family jewelry is going down, I can mention it as part of the country's 11 towers. If it succeeds, the next year the stock will be added.
Work in beauty is being done at a time when the Spermarcites are looking for ways to use places used for TV, microwatts, and family decorations.
Sensbury said that she would make up for the first time the size of the beauty offers of nearly 3,000 designs, such as Reunion, Tsermin and Dr. Pap.
El Uril, Mae Baine and Bertes Bez's current offers will also provide specific locations for the brand, as is the case in the boot's twos.
The Supermarket is also starting to re-launch its botanical mic-app so that more products are in accordance with the wishes of the green beers - something that young buyers are looking for more
In addition, the French shop will also test the diets in two Sansbrücks, one of which will appear last week in the hearty area of South London, while the other will open the region in the wake of the earthquake this year.
The change in order to buy daily food at low daily levels from online shopping and local convenience stores means that customers need to do more to make people feel comfortable.
Synzebrai's chief Asian Mike Cop explained that their outputs would look more like a disparate tower, while the Supermarket China is fighting the mass of goods and non-food industries.
Synzebray also places outlets of Arros in his hundreds of stores, and uses a number of hebtics since he bought the two-year-old Chances, which he says has added to his grammary flow.
The previous effort to create the Supermarket was unsuccessful to create the beauty and beauty of the perfumery.
In the 2000 ’ s, Sinzbrai had tried a joint effort with bots, but it ended after the merger to break down the arrival from the Camst Stores.
This is the new practical moment when Sensbry sold his 281-star firm's trade at 125 million pounds at the price of Leads Company Xin.
He said that in four stages of rapid surveillance, the Spring Brands will play a major role in this project, with the production of the wax.
Censor Director Paul Muls Hux said: "We have changed the shape and sense of beauty in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have specifically funded training activities that will be able to offer immediate advice.
We've been prepared to meet every need for our brands, and the simple environment and facilities means that now we've become an interesting place to produce beautiful designs that challenges the old size of purchases.
After leaving the 11 million-pound agreement in Holly Woluby, Peter Jones was "suffering"
The Star Peter Jones T.V. President Holly Wulby wants to focus attention on his new agreements with the 11 million pounds, with his life-style brand trade.
There's no time for the crossroads of clothing and leisure in their home with Wilby.
This couple's business is compared to Günthe Paltero's gypsum.
The 37-year-old minister of ten Marning announced that he would leave the stadium.
Holly Woluby, in the last minute, left them angry to say good-bye to Star Peter Jones of the Dragon Dane. He wants to focus with Wiluby Marks and Spencer and ITV on his firm focus.
The media said that June was "suffering" at the time when TV's Golden Grell admitted to Mangle in the area of Burkina Faso at a large meeting of their business administrators at their international headquarters that their new sales of 1.5 million pounds meant that she would not find enough time to put on the furniture and laundry trolley in the house of June.
Their business was compared to Günthe Pilturo's gop brand and was thought to be about 11 million pounds double.
Just as 37-year-old Wilubi announced that he was leaving the truck on the island, Georges quickly traveled to one of his holiday homes on board from Britain.
One media said: Trolley is much preferring Holly's first.
This is their next vision in two decades of the long-term future.
They've surprised everyone in their decision to leave it completely.
What was happening to Mangle was not going to happen to anyone.
There's a piece of equipment in Marlo headquarters that's ready to sell.
Experts believe that ten-marning's representative, one of Britain's most profitable starboarders, can damage the farm by taking clothes and furniture from the landscapes and furniture, because of the heavy work done by the company, with millions of pounds and the possibility of more delay in launching it.
And that could mean that a long friendship could end.
The mother of three children and her husband, Dan Baldon, have been approaching the star cop for ten years.
Wulby set up a trolley together in 2016 and 52-year-old jogs took the lead in March.
The couple spent their vacation together and had 40 percent of their share of the TV productions in Jus Baldon.
We're going to be a brand-new cipher for the Vulby M&S, and we're going to be staying at the I'm A Celebrity's place at the Ant Mekparttalen.
George's neighbor's media said last night that we won't comment on his business.
"And we were endeared with love."
They accused themselves of commenting on what some people thought to be "foreign presidents" and mocked at North Korea's mayor.
Why has President Trump given so much attention?
Thrup said in a loud voice to his 'new appearance'.
"I didn't get tired of anything."
He recalled that they are less interested in another visit with him than he had previously set an important step towards the recent attack on North Korea's nuclear weapon in June.
Lycle-depleted weapons are the victims of the massacres.
After more than three months of the meeting in Gandapur in June, North Korea's deputy Ri Yongho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see the "responsibility" of the initial actions of its small arms.
Instead, he said that the U.S. has continued restrictions on increasing pressure.
Trump liked his Riley speech more.
They said: "We are going well with North Korea
We were fighting North Korea.
Millions of people would become velvet.
Now our connections are strong.
He said that the positive results of their efforts to improve relationships have been achieved - the end of the rocket tests, the release of the hostages, and the return of the remains of the U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual status in talking about relationships with a little bit.
Trump pointed to Hujum, saying, "It's so easy to be a Muslim, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people into this crowded place, you're looking at about 200 people in front of you."
In Indonesia, tsunami, earthquake disaster, hundreds of thousands of lives
As a result of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they did not need it.
Although 10 percent of Lumbuk's population had lost their homes, the national disaster was not announced, which is the basic target for international aid.
Ms. Sombong said that in many cases, unfortunately they were quite clear that they would not ask for international aid, which is a little bit of a compliment.
When Sio de Schhardren is setting up a team to go to Paulo, he's not sure that his work will be done on the occasion.
The translator of the National Agency for Natural Disasters, Mr. Sopoto, said that the Indonesian authorities are examining whether or not international agencies should be allowed to participate in relief efforts.
Despite the constant presence of earthquakes, the country is not ready to face natural disasters.
When we arrived, shelters were built to protect ourselves from the tsunami, and they were not even visible on the seashore.
In Palo, the absence of somnolence-warning surgeons is likely to be responsible for the deaths of humans.
In the best times, many Indonesians are asked to travel among the islands.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
For the treatment of the earthquake in Lombok, the mission is heading to the hospital Paulo in the sea, but it will take him at least three days to reach the new site of the natural disaster.
President Joko Voddo has set up his election framework to improve the Indians' efforts to improve, and he has spent his heart on the streets and the railways.
But Joko's administration is facing Fandz's deficits, while the next elections will be next year.
Janab is also under pressure from the growing religious extremism in Indonesia, while some of the majority of the Muslims have adopted a more solid form of religion.
Between the groups of Jesus and the believers, there were more than 1,000 people who were killed and several hundred people who were homeless, including the Hinber, the bow, the arrow, and other weapons.

When I saw the knife coming in, I just hit the ball once and hit it with no more thought.
Chalsey got a top score of 0-1 in 25 minutes from the Bulgarian Star Edn Hazerd in the Haf Time.

Most recent memories of the "re-ordering date" of Will's diagram outside the parliament
The destruction of the search for so many cultural and religious aspects of England that would be natural justice for its genius and district followers.
But Kerim Well Society has designated Mr. Carx's proposals as "unknowable" and "an attempt to restore history."
Kerem Well Society's Sheerman John Goldsmith said: In the current debate on the removal of the mosques, it was a shame that the museum of the Pales of Constantester would be the target of the Valier Kerem Well.
Kerem Weil did not order the British army to destroy the image and not execute it.
Maybe in the past century, his parents were wrong to make a sacrifice to Will.
Sir Willim Hamo Thorni Curt's excellent representation of the Warehouse is evidence of 19th century's opinion and part of a figure of a figure that many people think is appreciated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sandy Tele Graf: "Many people, perhaps more than in the early 19th century than today, imagine a defender of parliament against the Kingdom who was probably for them.
Is this a proper representation of the ongoing historical debate?
One thing that is certain is that the middle 17th century's introduction laid the foundation for the growth of our country's sparks, and Kerim Will is a well-known individual who represents a part of this division.
As the Lord projector, their uses are valuable and memorable.

The remainder of the ocean storm will bring heavy rains in the South West America
As foretold, the rainy waters of the northern Pacific of Mexico have become weaker and weaker.
However, daily rains will occur in the coming days in northern Mexico and South Western U.S.

The river Atenai, the sea is starting to become a trajectory above the lake, and is heading east to the western coast of the Americas, as a daily Monday is heading towards a southern California level at the summit. As a Hari storm, it will turn the Hari not to the north to the western United States.
On Monday, it will rain 10 inches [10 inches] in some parts of Mexico.
Then, with Hari's not coming traffic, there's going to be heavy rains in the south west.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of dangerous rain will lead to the loss of oil, clothing, and possibly dust in the desert.
The Great Hari will take the rainfall rate from 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in southern Newda and parts of the wantona.
In some parts of the South West, most of the desire is 2 to 4 inches of rain.
The rapid change in the nature of the rain is likely to result from the rapid change in the climate of the rain.
The danger of Harry's rain would make it very uncertain to advise on how to go out in the wilderness.
The heavy rain can turn water currents into raging waters, and the hail will cause storms and storm clouds.
Increased traffic will bring local heavy rains in some parts of the southern California coast

More than 20 million people saw Brett Kenya’s hearing
Justice Brett Kenya and women, who allegedly accused them of sexual abuse in the 1980s, saw Christine Blassi Ford, Mangle on six television networks, more than 20 million people.
While the debate continues, political instability continues, and the unexpected situation of the last minute on Friday, which was the result of which Senator Jeff Fleg of the E.B. wanted to prepare an agreement to investigate a week's charges by the F.B.A., the NSBs have created obstacles in their regular programs.
Mr. Ford told the Senate's judicial committee 100 percent believe that while drinking during a high school party, Kenivo tried to take it off and take it off.
Kenya has said 100 percent during emotional evidence that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people have heard of Agaha, according to the news from Nelson.
The company's CBC, ABC, CNC, Fax News Channel and MCBC were counting the average supervisors.
PBS, C-SPAN and Fax Business Networks were not available for other networks, which showed it.
And Nelson has a problem measuring people in common offices.
In view of this point, the size of its supervisor was as much a flat of a football match as it was.
Nelson reported on the fax news channel, whose partner supported the Kenyan conference with an average of 5.69 million monitors across the network during the entire day's hearing.
A.B.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.
Nelson reported that 3.1 million of CBC, 2.94 million of CBC, 2.89 million of MCB, and 2.52 million of CNN were overseers.
After hearing, there was still interest.
On Friday, the drama was the focus of the movie.
After a statement of vote on Kenya's average favorite Republican office continued, on the morning of Thursday, C.E.N. and C.S. Cameras filmed them in the state that the audience was running on them just as they tried to get up to an elevator for hearing the judicial committee.
CNN was directly shown that he kept his eyes down for a few minutes when they were being severely tortured.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here."
Do you think that he is telling the truth?
It is said to him, “You have the right to have a great deal of women.”
Fly said that his office had reported and said more before the elevator was closed, they had more to say in committee hearings.
Cable and NS Networks were directly investigating all the events, when the judicial committee had to count the commission of Kenya to send the full Senate to vote.
But Flye said they'd only do it with the notion that they'd be investigating charges against F.B.I. Kenya's next week, which political Democrats are also insisting on.
Fly was convinced after talking to her friend Democrat Senator Chris Kuz.
Kuz and later, after talking to several other senators, Flye made her decision.
Flying's choice was important, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the necessary voice to approve Kenya without research.
President Trump has ordered an investigation into the E.B.E. of charges against Kenya.

I've seen my parents cry for joy, but now we're stuck.
In December of this year, although the regional elections are important, although with fewer Margen, Catalan freedom groups are facing difficulties in maintaining movement this year because many of their well-known leaders are forced to do their own will or to manage the upgrades and then to declare freedom.
A 42-year-old Mexican young Puig, who was recording protests on the phone in support of the police, said that the politicians on both sides had given the air to Razza.
He said there's an increase in expansion.
In the past year, a U.S.-Katalan-Kidin-Kidin-Kidin-Kidin-Kidan-Kidan-Kangwaras announced on the week that they will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
He said that standing up as a hope in the European elections is the best way to condemn the injustices of the Spanish government.
Land Darry: Three people were arrested for driving home
There are 33, 34 and 39 people arrested in one house in London Darrye in a multiple car shooting.
The event was presented to the representatives of Britain on average at about 19:30 a.m. in the Bolmangard Crescent.
Sir George Inspector Bab Bliamnisch said that the gate and the building had been damaged.
There's been a shot at the car at some point.
Wins from Mengo's ball on the reindeer of Livingstone from 0-1.
The first Goul to win for Dolly Mango's Leongston.
The advanced Lionston surprised Reinsurers with victory and caused a second defeat in 18 games by Stephen Gerard, as the manager of the Ibrax Club.
The strike of Dolly Manga was different while the Harry Holt team was on the other track.
Gerard's team is on the ground with no winnings in the premier shop, and the next weekend it will be against Harts, who is behind eight points.
Before that, the Reinsurers will play against Rapid Vienna in the U.S. League.
At Mount Atenai, Lungston Dugan has taken his career to six games and the head of the mobile home has not suffered any attacks since the last month's Keni Miller.
Livingston's hats are less likely to be against the visitors.
The Holt team had to take the lead before the score, when their skull pushed the reindeer with all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson did the trick, but he was able to take his attempt to the most likely bullet, and then Elen Lethgrove found himself more extensive before the bullet of this Craig Halkett had to meet Ar Hader.
Mezban team Reinsurers was happy to let them play with them, knowing that they could put the visitors into trouble in the seat.
And that's the most important thing that came into being.
Reingers prepared a fresh cake and Lungston started when Dickalan and Galagher met Manga together, who scored from the middle of the box.
To this point, Reinsurers' position was limited, but they found that the Mizban team's defense was invincible, and the bullet cap is still in charge.
This is Peter's stay in the other port, if Alfredo Murlos gets a grant from Kali.
Scott Putmin lost Ellen MacGreer on the roundabout of the Renaissance, and Lathgrove shot away another set of seats in Lungston.
Lungston's house continued to be in peace and to be in peace, while only two cases of the penultimate were made -- when Halkat met the replacement Glen Madleton and was rejected for a handlebal.
By Leongston’s “Unusual ” Survey
Alus Dar Lamont, Biscay Scotland, in Toni Macaroni Arena
It's an unusual operation and result for Lungston.
For one person, they were powerful, who continued to be more active in this high-speed journey.
After their flight back to their cabin, the stables and teams have changed very little, but the real reward goes to the Holt that built the team after it arrived.
He's got a lot of heroes.
The Capatan Halkit continued to be violent, which was very beautifully managed to defend itself, while Minga kept the Crown Goldenson and the world on top of five during the whole game.
But in Reingards, he wasn't jealous.
As much as they're under Gerard's leadership, they couldn't meet those standards.
There was no control over their songs, and they could only start at once against the hostess -- and it's a danger for the reindeer when they're in the middle of the score table.
Warfare meeting for the camps
On the day of the week (29 September), there was a smile and a blue sky when Turkish and German prisoners met on the street.
This was the last day of the Tenaza tour of Germany's President's camps - the aim of which was to improve relations between networks.
They differed from human rights, press freedom, and Turkey's identity in terms of matters.
After the camps, the clocks ran to open up a huge new temple.
Most of the people left in this city after Turkey.
Police have referred security services to stop Hughum 25,000 from meeting in front of the Muslim, but several Hami have gathered to see their president.
Hundreds of camps opposed demonstrations -- more of which they had done -- even condemned the German government, as well as the police of the camps and said good-bye to them in the country.
These examples illustrate this. Some Germans praise the camps as heroes, while others consider them as a stubborn pagan ruler.

Fonx, Las Vegas, South Lake City, from the Sea Flood, may be at risk of oil spills (water - affected areas)
The desire for a hare-bottle is indistinguishable, but the possibility of such a thing is in the beginning of the next week when the remaining power of the ocean will be on the south-west side of the desert and will pose a threat to the sea.
The National Spring Service has already launched a series of military raids for South and Eastern Nevada from Western hopes for Monday and Sunday, east of California, north of California and east of Fonx, Flag Staff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
After Monday's arrival with the rain, Mangle is expected to take a straight path on Fonx.

The possibility of raining between 1 and 2 inches in the other parts of the south-west, including the Central Rockies and the Great Beans, while the total rainfall may be 4 inches in total in the area.
Areas that are at risk of storms will be the mercy of the daily rain because it is a sign of drought.
Although the threat of floods is a serious threat, some of the rains are likely because the South West region has been inundated with droughts every year.
According to the U.S. dry annual monitor, more than 40 percent of the desire is the most dry annual catch that comes in the second highest categorization has been reported by weather.com.
First, the daily route will pass through the California area of Mexico.
The day that was left with more than 85 miles an hour in the morning with the winds of the week, the force of the sea storm remained at 385 miles south of Panta Agonia, in Mexico, and it is moving from 12 miles an hour north.
The storm is facing cold waters at sea, and its power is diminishing.
So, it's expected that this will break into Mexico on Monday afternoons or evenings with the force of the Hari Flood.
In some parts of Mexico, rain may be heavy and may pose a threat to the flow
According to weather.com, the average of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Southern California to the West Sun, and more than 10 inches are expected.
The day will then lead the way to the east of Mexico as a rainstorm, and the morning will reach the threshold of hope as a rainstorm, and then it will reach the south end of the moon as a rainstorm.
The National Marine Flood Centres indicated that the daily and its remains are expected to be at great risk of extreme rainfall in northern California, the North West Sonora, and the American Desert in the South West.
The rains make it possible to drop soils in the deserts and in the mountainous regions of the desert.

Tramp says Kenya's Democratic Party's 'community, anger' said.
Trump told a Riley in the Helling region of West Virginia that the vote for Judge Kenya means a vote to stop the Democratic Party's inconvenient and shameful schemes.
Trump accused Kenya of having endured the "commitment and anger" of the Democratic Party in its act of marriage.
The Kenyans testified against the Congolese, and converted them into prosecuting and emotional charges of Christine Blossi Ford, and Christine accused them of having been sexually harassed for decades when they were underage.
Ford also testified to his charges during the hearing.
The president claimed the week that the Americans showed Kenyan culture and courage that day.
He told a Hami in West Virginia that a vote for the confirmation of Judge Kenya will be a vote of the most capable legal personality of our times and with the excellent record of the public service.

He said that one of the most important choices in our life is only five weeks away.
I'm not taking part in it, but I'm actually taking part.
That's why I'm going everywhere about the strong hopes.
Trump argued that the Democrats are employed at the mission of "comfort and prevention"

In Indonesia, earthquakes, and hundreds of tsunamis increase in deaths.
It was carried away when at least 384 people went to tell the truth and talked to a number of skyscrapers in the Indonesian island of Silvia, which the government reported on the week.
Hundreds of people in Palo City gathered on the beach for a mile (or 18 ft) when the high tides flowed from the beach to the west and took people along their way.
Sunami 7.5 was born after the earthquake.
BNPB's agency for natural disasters in Indonesia, Sotopou and Nugruho told a firm in Jakarta that when the last day was threatened with tsunami, people were still engaged in their activities on the coast they did not run away immediately and became prey to the waves.
Nagreho said that Sonami took everything away from cars, trees, houses, and land. He added that before crossing the sea, the sea was 800 kilometres per hour (497 miles per hour).
He said, “The people have gone up to the trees to protect themselves from the sun, and thus have escaped.”
About 16,700 people have been transferred to the relief march in Palo.
The extensive images by the agency can destroy buildings and doves, crash and sink into a temple in the water.
In the coastal city, there is also a rapid earthquake.
The earthquake hit 2.4 million people in the area.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Research and Application (BPPT) said that the massive earthquake on Thursday was nearly 200 times more than the atom's power dropped in the Great Dome.
He said that maybe the city's cave, which is on a long and narrow church, has increased the severity of the tsunami.

A person standing at the top of a building in a non-frontal street on social media is strongly warning people about the coming of Somalia.
Within minutes, a wall of water was cut off from the beach and carried along the buildings and cars.
Writers didn't immediately confirm the photo.
As a result of earthquakes and tsunamis, large amounts of electricity were generated, causing disturbances in the tourism system around Palo, and it was difficult to organize relief activities for the government.
The army has begun sending relief supplies to the workers' ships from Jakura and other cities, but the victims still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport is only reopened for aid operations and will be closed for other aircraft until October.

Not yet.
A translator of the Indonesian Red Cross, Olya Auri, said that it is still a disaster at the surface of the sowa.
Once the government says it's right, this is a national disaster, we need international aid, but it's not yet granted.

The Ripper Winds are changing their name to Y.
Speaking of the week's change on Twitter, he wrote: "I am commonly known as the Winds West."
It's been known for some time as the title of the eighth album, which was released in June.

I understand that the most common word used in the Bible is 'ye' and in the Bible it means 'you'.'
So I'm you, I'm us and that's us.
It came from the wind, which means just one more time, it's now one, which is our goodness, our greatness, our anxiety and all that's reflected in everything.
Albums are also a reflection of who we are.

Determined not to use a military force against Mexico’s AMLO citizens
Mexico's elected president Andris Manuel Lopez Obradour has expressed his determination never to use force against the citizens, while the country's bloodthirsty revenge against the country is on the 50th bridge.
Lopez promised to never use the army against the people of Mexico in Telalolko Plaza on the week.
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers killed at least 300 people, at least on a peaceful display in the Plazas, at a time when the left-wing movement was holding walls across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people with education by giving them monthly scholarships and more free government universities.
He said that the lack of freedom of education and education attracts young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. has to double the funding for the A.I.
While China is becoming more active in the field of creative intelligence, the United States has to double the amount spent on research in this field. This is what the author and E.I. CEO Kai Foley said who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments are being made at a time when various parts of the U.S. government have made E.I. announcements, although the United States generally does not have an O.I.D. agency.
Dr. Odinaj, Chan announced his plan last year. He wants to be number 1 in the E.I. by 2030.
And Lee said, "Oh, come on, it's a good start to double the research budget, while all other countries are behind the U.S. and we're waiting for the next big inquiry."
Lee told C.B.C. on an interview this week that double funding would double the odds that the next great success in America is being achieved.
Lee, who published the book "A.I.E. Frameworks: China, Silicon Valley and the New World System" this month by H.E.M.M., Synovation Ventures, which is one of the most prominent companies in China, has been operating in ++Face.
In the 1980s, he worked on the A.I. System, which killed U.S.'s highest-ranking player, Othillo pilot, and later, he is president of an Asian and Google-based Chinese branch in the Microsafety Resources.
Lee praised the agency's robot-making challenge against the technology of the former U.S. government, such as the defense-advanced research plans, and asked when the next challenge would be to identify the next generation's engines.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to gain government support.
Lee said, "They're not Chinese, they're carporteurs who're taking TDs.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have received technical services from universities to work on IA in recent years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes can also help America to promote its I.D. efforts.
He said, "U.S.A.I., people with P.H.D. should automatically submit a Green Card."
In July 2017, China's Hellenistic Council continued to develop its next generation's creative mindset.
Lee said that the foundation of national natural sciences in China provides funds in such a way as national sciences to fund US researchers and other government agencies, but there is little standard for educational work in China.
In the beginning of this year, the U.S. Supreme Defence set up a joint creative intelligence center aimed at contacting participants from manufacturing and educational institutions, and White Houses announced the position of the Celtic Committee on Design.
And this year DARPA has a lead that I announced for 2 billion dollars.
As far as NSF is concerned, it now spends over $100 million a year on the AA research.
The U.S.A. has not worked for months to establish American law on the position of the National Security Commission on creative intelligence.
The Macedonian people took part in the referendum to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday whether the country's name should be called "the general northern Mammonia". This is a step that will resolve with Greece for decades, which has blocked Mammonia's state of affairs in the European Union and its networks.
Greece, whose name is Mammonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name shows the claim on its letter and that it vetted the entry of Mammonia into the net and eU
Both governments have signed a treaty based on the name of Majuja in June, but the reason for the ethnic identity of the majority of the population is that the name change will damage the ethnic identity of the majority of the population.
President George Awunoff said that they would not vote in the referendum and that the Biocat's campaign had raised doubts about whether or not at least 50 percent of the tournaments would be completed to support the referendum.
The text of the question at the referendum's ballot was: "Are you in favour of the network and the U.S. reservation to accept the agreement with Greece?"
The Germans believe that it is the price of entry into the states, such as the U.S. and the U.N., which is a country that is emerging from the end of Macedonia.
In Skopje, 79-year-old Olivera Georgesca said that I came to vote for the future of the country today, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live with European Union's ultimate freedom, because that means more lives for all of us.
Although it is not legally necessary, many Iraqis have said they will accept the outcome of the referendum.
Two-thirds of the majority will be required to change the name.
The Christian Election Commission said there was no news of the evils as far as 1st.
However, Turnout is only 16%, while in the previous parliamentary election in 2016 it was 34%.
A 62-year-old Goga Tanoschi in the capital of Skopje said I came to vote because I made a place in my children and in Europe.
Mammonia's special major force Zaif, his wife Struka and son Dashko on 30 September 2018 are voting in a referendum to change the country's name in the city of Stromika, Macedonia. This will pave the way for Mammonia to smooth the way for Net and European Union.
In front of the parliament in Spain, 54-year-old Mayor Cavadrekoff was preparing a small stage for those who would beam the platform and draw crosses in front of the camps.
Kavadrekoff said we're in favour of net and eo, but we want to go up and join them, not through the service door.
We are not a poor country, but a state of honor.
If they don't want to add us as a continent, we can turn to China and Russia, and we can be part of the Yuro-Ishia integration.
Major Ziff says the network will make the most of its resources in Macedonia. The country's rate of unemployment is more than 20 percent.
After casting his vote, Zaif said, "I think the vast majority will be responsible for it because 80 percent of our citizens are responsible for E and Networks.
They said, "Yes," and they said, "Our future will be confirmed."
On Monday, a survey by the Polish Police Research Institute of Indonesia said that between 30 and 43 percent of the voter will participate in the referendum - which is less than the demand of Turnout.
Another survey conducted by T.T.I., in Macedonia, said 57 percent of respondents want to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said to vote in 'yes'.
To make the referendum successful, Turnout has to have a vote above 50 percent.
In the referendum, failure will have been a major challenge for the policy of the Western Nine Government, which held power in May last year.

The president spoke about the Republican Turnout in the mid-term election, which indicated the situation of Brett Kenny, the official of his Supreme Court.
What we did will be on the plan in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our time.
He said, “This is a great thing; I do not stand in it, but I am a partner in it, and I fight everywhere for those of great hopes.”
Trump continued, "You're looking at this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you're looking at it happening.
And he's the most important thing to regain power from any means, you see their lack, their violence.
They don't think they're hurting anyone, and they're running to get power and control. They just need power and control, and we won't give them both.
He said that the Democrats are on the mission of 'disastering and obstructing'
They called Democrits "angrily, atrocious, and atrocious and false," and they said, "You've seen this in the last four days."
He referred to the Democratic Senator Dan Fynstein of the St. Justice Committee's reincarnation, which resulted in some voices from the audience.

No, no, it was really a bad band language -- the worst band language I've ever seen.
Leber doesn't have another wide-ranging house.
He does not withhold from his heart [the inclination of] what is in his heart.
When the employees of the credit card in my local party thought I was to blame, it was not surprising.
Finally, I'm the latest in the order of the Librarian Parliament that's said we're not welcome. That's why we're talking heartily.
My Paleman's girlfriend, Rini, faced a similar situation because they stood up to the Jews' enemy.
As far as I'm concerned, the accused movement has made me a target of criticism by agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national peace, Europe, and things like this that the former German prisoners do not agree with.
Notts for the meeting of Nethanelum East Libre, which will be held in August, said, "We want to make the meetings a different one and a different one."
As a local liberator, I had a similar meeting in my eight - year - old age group.
Unfortunately, today, many of the meetings have not been held and the policy of "Love and Mildness" has long been forgotten, of course, if ever started.
It is very clear that the opposition in the Liberian party is not being tolerated and that every opinion is seen by whether it is acceptable to the party or not.
It's just after Jeremy's leadership, because those with me who previously thought that they looked at a political point like me began to expect me to take a turn and to take a stand that would never seem to match in any other way -- whether it's national peace or a fair market.
When I talk to the public -- whatever I say -- social media starts to rain and discipline, and the requirements for renouncing begin, and I'm told I shouldn't be at the liberator party.
And that's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm happier than some of my friends because comments about me are political.
I'm surprised to see the leaders of those who suffer from sexual and racial discrimination every day, but do not lose heart.
One of the most desperate aspects of this far-off policy is how the levels of evil have become common.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Liber Party should promote the tradition of endurance.
The fact is that we are no longer in the broad range of homes, and the party seems more difficult to change with any untrustworthy movement or choice.
In the past two years, I've been advised to keep my head down, not to be so clear, then I'll be okay.
But I didn't come to do that in politics.
Since I was a student of a school 32 years ago, I've been involved in the book because of the influence of the Teacher government, which has led to the end of my compatriot school class, and I've tried to provide the best public service for those who need it most - whether as a local council or as a government official.
I've never hidden my policy, in the past choice.
There's no difference in any way in the Nethaneham East about my position and the inconsistency of the current leadership.
I'm just going to say about the people who moved the party to say that when the country has a hamlet that will hurt our families, our businesses and our public services, I don't want to lose time and energy with the Liberian party.
But only a message that I want to give not only to the nanny believers but also to those around me, whether I hold the book or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount or political will will prevent me from doing what I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Ir 17 - 38 Monday: Unbeatable Irrigation Reached the Island
Two recent efforts could eventually lead to a low level, but there's no doubt that Air has the right to win the amazing and fun game of this tenets primer shop.
They're now the top of the table and one of the ten teams that's not broken.
Finally, because of their better ability to defend and take a chance, they succeeded, and little Peter Mokov was absolutely right to be happy.
They said: "We have been tried in our play, and we have been overcome, so I should be pleased."
The robin Christi of Monday said, "I'm getting credit for IR, they took better chances against us.
In the 14th minutes of the Warrant Anderson effort, which Fresir Clemvo converted into a score, made Ire superior, but Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland was given the opportunity to increase the number on Monday when he received an Ilo Card and made a effort by Jason Begot.
Clemo has strengthened the superiority of Ier with a panel at the Haf Time, and he scored and then turned his only effort into a score and scored 5-17.
But on Monday, the second airport was well started and Patrick Anderson's effort, which Begot changed, had changed.
Richard Nett was slow enough for severe injuries and became even further advanced when the game began again when Stefan McDoll changed his efforts.
Then Irre's successor Captain Bilier McFront was shown the Ilo Card and again on Monday he took advantage of the presence of an additional player and tried to change which could not be changed.
The Mezban team went back to the game, but when the stereo was shown to the Haxen without a sound card, MacFron put the sound on the net on the IR attack.
Clemo scored as he had started again. Before that, Kyle Rue brought together David Armstrak's box of cake and tried five times to beat the Gregor Henry.
Steel Game Star Restoration of New Careers in the Restoration
The Steel Game's Star Ford Karen is ready to move into the factory of Mezba, and its name is found among the directors of a licensed restaurant in the company.
56-year-old Star Bebshaw plays the role of Jack Georges, who write and present along with long-term Comrade Partners Greg Affiliate
Both of them have announced that the next nine will be the last one, and it seems that after Craig Ling, the Karenans are planning to leave forever.
According to the official record listing, they're the directors of Arifingmorn Limited.
The prosecutor has refused to comment on the news, although the Scottish media said that Karenon Galago's 'extensive restaurants trade' are becoming involved.
"Ours is the hope of reopening the way to the sea by the judgement of Bolivian.
In Lapaz, the sailor is surrounded by seaheads.
The blue flag of the sea is playing on government buildings.
From the Tetaka Sea to the Amazon, it is written on the sea bass: "Our right is on the sea."
"It's our duty to take it back."
Houses from the desert all over Bolivia are still fresh in the memory of the absence of the sea in a bloodthirsty ceremony in 19th-century Bolivia, as well as the desire to travel to the sea.
Now these desires are at its highest level in several continents, while Bolivia is awaiting a decision of international justice on October 1 after five years of operation.
An expert in Bolivia, Roberto Kalzadila, said that Bolivia has a sense of strength, unity and temperament, and expects results with a positive view.
Most of the citizens of Bolivia will see ICJ's decision on large screens throughout the city, hoping that in Heg, he will decide on the claim of the tripartite Bolivian, that after several decades of unparalleled torture, he has been responsible for sending his country to the sea to self-restraint.
President YO Moraulis, who has a minority personality in Bolivia, has had to make a long decision on Monday.
He decided in August that his country was close to returning to the Mediterranean.
But some investigators think that it's not possible that the trial will decide on Bolivia -- and if it does, it won't make a big difference.
There is no right to refer them to the United Nations tribunal in the Netherlands, and he has decided that it will not determine the outcome of possible abuses.
In international law, a Chilean expert in Pakistan said, "It is true that the decision of the ICJ is given only six months after hearing the last trial shows that the case was not wrong."
Instead of promoting Bolivia's goal, it may have been lost for the past four years.
Zaratet said that the current administration of Bolivia has taken on the problem of access to the sea.
He said, "Moralis's argument has ended the rest of the banishment."
Bolivia and Goi can keep talking for a while, but then it's going to be very difficult to make jokes.
The two countries haven't exchanged the Scipheres since 1962.
Former President Edward Rhodes Voltage, who are the envoys of Bolivia in The Hague, has rejected the idea that the judicial process was unmistakably rapid.
He said that on Monday, going to Bolivia, it's an extraordinary opportunity to start a new distance of connections and end 139 years of inconsistency for mutual benefit.
Kalzdilla rejected the fact that Moralis, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the sea as a political instrument.
They also said, "Balivia will never be denied access to the sea.
The court's decision is an opportunity to highlight the need to forget the past
North Korea: Without confidence in the United States, nuclear weapons are not acceptable
North Korea's officials say that their country will never be immune to nuclear weapons when it doesn't trust Washington.
He was talking to the United Nations General Assembly on Sunday.
He asked the US to fulfil the promises made to the leaders of the two countries at the meeting in stone.
Their effects have occurred at a time when U.S. officials will re-start nuclear exploration in North Korea in May Pompeii.
Rei said it's a bad idea that the U.S. opposition to the declaration to end the Korean War in the arrests will force North Korea to break down.
Washington Pong Yang is concerned about this without mentioning any possible measures that might be taken by the armed forces.
The least and US President Donald Trump wants to see two other heads of government.
But there is a wide range of doubts about the fact that ponging is more serious than a weapon that he considers to be the only guarantee of his peace.
They want to visit Pong Yang next month to prepare for the second head meeting between Pompeii and Trump.
A large - size display of Paris face - to - face
Do not wait any longer if you want to increase the locking of your hats or completely block the heat.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browni have shown large-scale headgears on their SS19 locks for their SS19 locks, which in Paris Fezon's Vacay has decorated Styl's seat.
In the summer, there were a number of strange types of hats on the Instagram, and these designers sent their powerful users to Katwok.
Valentine's most prominent silver shirt with wide edges, such as silver, was a high-quality bee hat that covered the tops of the models.
In other large sizes, they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom also revealed the choice of the species of mosquitoes - presented on the occasion of En Haloin
A lot of colorful brown masks were worn and they saw Hannibal Lecter instead of the modern fashion.
One of them was Googles and Sanorcale, like the Sukoba Dywing Gier, while another steel ice cream looked like.
And if you keep telling the fact of the fact -- you're happy.
It's predicted that many such bonts will be the beauty of the shops near you.
Large sized hats from the "La Bumba" logos have come to the scene after the hats that were two-footed and were seen on each head from the Rhine to the Eile Rattacoschi.
The group label that spread on the entire social media has brought another great crowd to Katwak, behind this extremely unimaginable type of hat -- the beach bag, which is almost as big as it is in your own suit, is a model that has been built on it.

John Edward: Language skills for the world’s citizens
The free school of Scotland's educational class maintained a track record and continued with excellent test results in 2018, which has been strengthened in the efforts of individual and collective success in games, pianos, music and other communities.
With more than 30,000 applicants in the whole of Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), tries to provide the best level of service to both the host and the parents.
Free Schools prepare their students for their place as careers and world citizens, their next and highest education, their chosen careers and their careers.
As a teacher who can prepare and apply a better school layout, we see modern languages in schools as an enjoyable and enjoyable article.
Nelson Mindila said, "If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, he's in his head.
If you speak to someone in your own language, she'll get into his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot depend only on English to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
With the results of this year's recent trial, we can see that the language in free schools is at the top of the League Tables with the highest level of accessibility.
A total of 68% of non-national readers received Hier Grada.
Data gathered from the 74 remaining schools of SCIS shows that 72 percent of the candidates received Hier Grada in Mandarin, while 72 percent German, 69 percent French, and 63 percent Spanish, also received A Grada.
It shows that free schools in Scotland support important skills such as foreign languages that children and young people are likely to need in the future.
Language is now the same as STEM articles (Scientific, Technology Engineering and Science) in the selection of articles in free schools and other places.
A 2014 survey by U.S. News and Skills revealed that 17 percent of the problems in filling vacancies have been reported in language skills.
So young people are getting more and more out of language skills to prepare for their future careers.
As if languages are needed for more employment opportunities, these skills are needed in today's world.
Look at the swan of careers, if anyone learns another language, they will benefit in the future because they have such a life-long skill.
Having the ability to speak directly to people from foreign countries gives a lot of people the opportunity to face
YouGov Polo, in which more than 4,000 older people in Britain were questioned in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well, and French is the only language spoken by two Indians, 15 percent.
That's why today's children need to spend money on language learning.
A number of languages, especially those with advanced skills, increase the opportunities for children to get good news.
In Scotland, different languages are being read in each school.
Many schools focus more on classical modern languages, while others read languages that are most important for Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
No one likes your child, a number of languages will always be available in free schools, and a skilled worker in this field will be a skilled worker.
Scotch Free Schools are a priority for providing educational environments that will make children beautiful and equipped with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
In the current global business environment, languages cannot be denied the importance of the country's future, so it should be reflected in education.
Of course, new languages need to be seen as "international entertainment skills".
This will continue to be a choice, a step forward, for young people in free schools in Scotland.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward Scotch, director of the Schools of the Andeans.
Lee Brown will start playing for lessons in Digo on Sunday.
For those audiences who want to see Lee Brown playing for Los Angeles Lucks, it's almost over.
Lekres's little girl, Lech Walton, announced that James Digo would play against Dinour Nights in the late summer match.
But he doesn't know how much time he'll play.
Walton said on Lex's website that it's going to be less than 48 minutes.
Lex's reporter Mike Tradel tweeted that maybe James would play for minutes.
At the beginning of this week, after the projects, he was asked about his plans for the six-gams match in Lechers.
He said, "I don't need to be prepared for this stage of my career"
Time of the West Virginia Relay of Tempus, YouTube Channel
President Trump is starting a series of relays selected from Helling in West Virginia since the night.
It's the first of the five relays of the hit scheduled for next week, including friendly places to stop for a little while in both tennis and Mississippi.
Due to the fact that they are under the veto of the Supreme Court to hold an empty seat on their vote, the tempo is trying to provide public support for the temporary elections because the elections to the Republicans in November are at risk of losing control of the Congolese.
When's the real night of West Virginia of Trump and how can you see it online?
The West Virginia area of Trump is expected to be 7 September 2018 on Saturday evening, 29 September 2018.
You can see online through the Live Stream on the Pacific YouTube of West Virginia.
Perhaps your lawyer for the Trump Superim court will talk about hearing the week of sexual harassment charges for Bret Kiwano, and the consent of the expected cents has been combined for a week to complete the investigation of the F.B.A.
But Reilian's main objective is to help Republicans move to November's elections.
So, according to the reporters, the election of President Trump's election has indicated that next week, the Rallys' goal is to "impower workers and workers while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the representatives of the Republican Senate and the United States".
An interpreter of the Trump election, who has refused to reveal his name, told Writers that "it is important to keep control of the Congress for the head's agenda so that they will visit as many states as possible while we're in the middle of a business relationship with the Chechen."
According to West Virginia Metro News, in Hellingu, wesbanko, which is set in Iran today, will gather the males from Ohio and Pennsylvania and take the corner of the Pittsburgh media."
A week's journey will be the second time in the past month that Trump traveled to West Virginia. This is the state in which he achieved more success than 40 percent points in 2016.
The Republicans of West Virginia are trying to help Patrick Morris, who is behind the election in Poland.
According to reporters, a political expert at the West Virginia University, Simon Hyder, said that it is not a good sign for Morris that the president is coming to bring them to Poland."
Reader Cap 2018: Team U.S.A. is determined to fight hopes for Sunday’s goal
After three consecutive sessions, the afternoon of the week was the same as that of the couple.
The amount of pandum movement is a completely invented game idea, but it's an idea that the players are convinced of, and it's never going to happen as well as it's going to happen in a competition like them.
Then what will they say, "Where is the Record (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)?"
So, on the day he stepped up, Jordan Spyth said, he had a six-point high and now he's four, so I think we're taking him a little bit of a move.
Of course, Europe has the upper hand, with four points ahead when they can try to get more.
As Satith said, the Americans feel that their feelings are still a little overdue, and they have enough to hope for, especially in the form of Satith and Wyton Tams, who are playing together all day and each of them gets three points.
The songs are being played by satellites, and they've set an example.
When his rounds were running, the waves of the seas were rising high when they threw the ball into the hole with a slight blade and called its name from four to four balls -- at a time when Thomas and they were behind two points after two points.
Their golf course was 15 when the match hit them, and they were happy to raise their voices, in such a way as to tell you that they didn't think the U.S. team was out of combat yet.
You just have to work hard for your ball and be concerned about it.
It's just that each of these players is gone now.
There's 18 holes left.
In the past two days, the only player who gets more than half a point is the French proprietary and Tommy Flatwood, who is a Muslim story of the Reader Cup.
Europe's team is amazing, but this desirable couple is perfect and they don't expect error.
"Maliwood" was the only couple who didn't shoot at the afternoon of the week, but they saved the morning of the week, the evening of the week, and the morning of the week.
This race, and the way their power moves from the wind to the wind, makes sure that they are the only players who will be able to catch up on Sundays and will not be allowed to stand up to them except for flatwood or a merchant who will be able to make sure the European team's victory is assured when the Gulf is defeated by the sun at the national level.
On the other hand, they're both on the other side of the halls.
The beautiful words of Europe are before, yet.
Boba Watson and the Web Sampson finished their early morning hero when his partner was with Alex Lunar.
In the first nine holes, a bottle and two doubles dropped the Spanish and the Swedish couple into a hole from which they could never get out.
Sunday, though, you won't have to help get out of the hole.
Between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way that practical wisdom changes in a moment of time are wonderful to see in the morning and in the afternoon.
So far, the European team has shown a good game as a team and has maintained its excellence until the end of the day, but this press session has shown that Team U.S.A. is also encouraged to fight, which some people are doubting the status side.
Europe's top 10-6 on the last day of the Reader Cup
On the day of the week on the United States, soon Bales and soon the European Reader Cup will be shown with a clear superiority on the last day of the European Reader Cup.
Tommy Flatwood and Francisko Malinari's jealous couple started with two matches on Tieger Woods built in the earthquake and has now taken their TV to four points in the Gulf National.
The European team of Thomas Beron, who was trying to keep his traffic lost two years ago in Heseltine, was on the American team in the early morning and won 3-1.
U.S. has more resistance and two matches live, but the loss has not been met.
We need eight points in 12 solid matches on Sunday to keep the team from traffic.
Flatwood is an early stop (refilling player) team that won four points in a row, while they were paired with the owner, who was the flyer of "Maliwood" after a Sunshine World Cup and was the first pair in the history of the Reader Cup who won four points in their original four matches.
Soon after beating the Woods and Patrick Red in Bales, they won the best together the damaged Woods and the American detainee Brisen Dishambio out of 5&4.
Woods, who managed to make a success of the week in two matches, showed a lot of coincidence, but they have lost 19 of their immediate Bales and immediately out of 29 matches and seven of them.
The hot day that rested in the early hours of the morning was to bring Henry Stanson back to life, and it was 2&1 that killed Dust Jansen and Wax Kepaka, who are the first and third world rankings.
A happy and windy day in the western region of southern Paris.
The three-time winner of the competition, Jordan Spyth and Guton Thomas, set a standard for Americans with two points a week.
They immediately won a 2&1 victory over the lives of Spain in Balz and Ain Polter and then beat him and Miklauri to 4&3 after the loss of two rafts in Smez.
In the history of Reader Cup only twice has returned to the game after the loss of four points, although the Firek team had only to maintain traffic balance.
After two days on the other number, however, it seems that the response will be out of reach on Sunday.
North Korea is said to be "not the only reason for confidence" to be unarmed on the one hand.
North Korean officials told the United Nations on Saturday that the bans undermine their country's confidence in the United States and that their country would not be challenged by its atomic weapons on the one hand.
Rey Yongho told the annual General Assembly of the World Bank that North Korea had taken "descriptive steps" last year, such as stopping atomic and missile tests, ending the nuclear test site, and promising to prevent the spread of atomic weapons and nuclear technology.
They said, "But we don't see a response from America."
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national peace, and in no circumstances will we be the first unarmed unarmed in the first place.
When Rei reiterated the claims of North Korea regarding the "Mahala War" action of Tafi's nuclear weapon against Washington, his statement is noteworthy that he has not completely rejected the single-sided armed weapon, as Pong Yang has been doing in the past.
On 12 June, Rey referred to a joint statement that followed the first official meeting of the current US President and North Korean leader, who had promised to try to "clean the Korean letter with atomic weapons", while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's peace.
North Korea wants to end the Korean War 53-1950, but the United States has said Pong Yang will destroy his nuclear weapon first.
Washington has also resisted the demands to lower severe international restrictions on North Korea.
Rei said, the United States insists on the "former nuclear weapon" and, in force, increases the level of pressure to pursue its goal, and even ignores the declaration of "the end of the war".
The idea that restrictions can force us to bend is a common sense of people who don't know about us.
The problem is that bans are constantly increasing in untrustworthy confidence.
Ri has not mentioned any plans to meet the other leader between the least and the least, which the US presidents have previously announced in the United Nations.
Instead, in the last five months, the Viserer referred specifically to three visits between South Korean leaders and said, "If this particular issue of nuclear weapons were a party to South Korea, it would not have been the case in the United States of America."
However, Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year's speech, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that after establishing a self-restraint mission at the "master Satan's President" Trump, the country of the United States has failed to support the United States with the rockets of North Korea.
Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised the United Nations for taking steps towards the Small Atom Weapons. However, he said that there is still much to do, and that the nuclear weapons from North Korea should continue to be banned.
Tramp said they don't have time, it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.
The reason for China and Russia is that the United Nations must reward ponging Yang for the steps to be taken by the United Nations.
However, the US Secretary of State, Michael Pompopoo, told the UN Peace Council: "We must continue with the strict and unscrupulous nature of the peace talks until we achieve the complete, final and confirmed goal of the nuclear weapon."
Peace Council has increased restrictions on Pong Young's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, consistent with North Korea since 2006
Pompeii met with Rei on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and then told them that they would visit Pong Young next month to prepare for the meeting.
Pompeii has already visited North Korea three times this year, but their last visit is not going well.
While walking from Pong Yang in July, he said he was ahead, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of "demanding money".
North Korea promised me this month to end a facility for a meeting with me and also an Atomic Complex, while the state's united "response" takes place.
He said, "The least he has told them is that the answer is a guarantee of peace in what he wants, which he has promised in the grave, and that he has the means to communicate with Washington.
The participation in the course of receiving a lot of sleep by Harold the caller
The Harvard University has encouraged all its inner graduates to get more sleep this year under a new course so that they can cope with a maniac increased by "Saturday Night" with the help of caffeine.
One study found that the first number of students in the university of the world is often unknown when things are very basic, like how to think about them.
At Harvard Medical School, Professor of Dream Medicine and Bry Gam And Amens has prepared a special Charles Sjerler course in the hospital, which they say is the first course of its kind in the United States.
After giving a talk about the impact of sleep loss on reading, they were moved to start the course.
He said, “A girl came to me at the end of the story, and said, ‘Why is this happening to me when I am in my senior year?’”
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep -- a fact that surprised me.
This course, which began this year's first call, explains how good gold practices help in teaching and playing and in addition to making their common sense better.
At Harvard Medical School, Professor of Mental Disease and University Health Executive Director Paul Barra said that the University decided to use the course after finding out that there is a severe shortage of sleep during the week.
In the course of an hour or so, there's one thing about the tax that's used in the course.
There is a picture of a hotel room in a set, which contains the effects of the call for caffeine and light, and how sleep play is affected and enough cups, screens, coaches and books to know the importance of gold.
In another scenario, the participant is told how long sleepless heart, stroke, depression, and cancer are increasing the risk of sleeplessness.
With good looks, a map of the campus encourages a participant to think about his daily routines.
Paul Seciler said more, we know that the caller's attitude will not change immediately.
But we understand that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about their effects when choosing a cigarette.
He said that there is still a habit of feeling proud of "night after night," and he added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on the applicant means that sleeplessness is an increasing problem.
They said to make sure that you sleep well enough to cope with pressure, fatigue and anxiety, you have to be the "secret weapon" of the caller, even in order to escape the Mutapa, because the sleepless brains put in the mode of hunger, which they feel constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old student in California, Raymond So, who is learning chemistry and natural life, has helped prepare a course by Professor Paul Cjerler before he took a class in Harard during his first year.
He explained that the course opened his eyes and made him secure in order to try to start the course in the entire campus.
He hopes that the next phase will complete all the post-goveree candidates before they join the competition agency.
Professor Seciler has recommended that the caller should consider when to go to bed and when to wake up and they should be aware of the side effects of the "blue light" coming out of the light. This light can create unbalanced sleep in your system of change of night and day.
Win: Manga beats Gerard’s players with bullets on the reincarnations of Lingston.
Reinsurers was struck by another alarm when a series of Dolly Menga beat Stephen Gerard's unarmed team in Lungston with a bullet.
The team of Ebrax was looking to record their first victory in February 4-1 in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team, in 18 games, ruled his second victory over Manger Gerard and left his team away from Ledbrox Prime Minister Leaders Harts' occupation only eight points.
Menga has been wandering for seven minutes before half an hour, and she has never been taken away by a non-violent Reinsurers team.
When the reincarnations are now on the number six, Lungston has stepped on the number three and is behind only a bullet from the divider of the sharks.
Gerard may have more problems when he got stuck in his head with something else that appeared to be falling off the line.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which led to the end of the Air Bedford Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went out with the Livi 11 who gave her a point from Harts last week and would be happy to see how his turn on each turn reduced the turn of the opponents.
Maybe the reindeer was alive, but Lungston kept the ball in his control.
They only scored within two minutes of the start of the game when Scott Putmin was the first time to go back to Manga and hit Alan MacGreer's ball, but Medfielder saved time.
Keni Jacks reached the Fry Cook Cupon Craig Holket, but their defence partner Elen Lethgo was only thrown to the back post.
Reinsurers must have found control of the game, but in the final third part, they could only be expected instead of believing in their play.
Alfredo Murillos certainly felt that on the fourth-hour mark, he had a penalt when he and Stephen Lalys broke up between him and him, but refrigerated Stephen Thomson dismissed the apple of Colombia.
Reinsurers could only hit two shots at the Haf before, but Ibrax's previous bullet caper, Kali, had no trouble with the weak head of Lassana Kolibali and the Oui Oriya's weak shot.
In 34 minutes, Levi's opera could be opposed to the opening of the game, but no one can deny that it was their first need.
Once again, Reinsurers failed to work on the Jackbes scheme.
Scott Arfeld couldn't react quickly when Dickalan Galicer threw it to the sound Scott Robinson and chose Mango to finish his project with a cold spell.
At the time, Gerard replaced Rie Kant instead of Kolibali, and this change almost immediately showed an effect when Winger gave Marilous a blow, but the impressive Kali rushed to stop him from his line.
But Leongston continued to force guests to play their favorite game while others put on long-lasting shots one after another.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage when Lathgrove threw it from the corner to the head of Jacks, but MacGreer came on the road and failed their efforts.
In exchange for Reinsurers, Glen Madleton filed an adjournment of a panel when he was in contact with Jackbez, but Thomas ignored it.
Tim: Geger’s Computer Museum
And now a page from "Sunday morning": Today, counting 136 years ago, 30 September 1882, the future scientist Johannes Willalm was born in Germany.
Gezer developed a method of painting and measuring, which was an invention that eventually led to Gagger's computer.
It is not only the science but also the pope's greatest support, as seen throughout the 1950s in the "Bels of Coronado" which appears to be the unmistakable case of scientists Rey Rogers and Del Evans:
The human being will be asked, "What is the matter with you?"
Rogers: "It's a gager counter, which is used in the book of Meandiath, like the hero.
When you put these phones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that are generated from radiation in the world."
Evans: "Yes, it's really popping up!"
Hans Gezer died a few days before his 63th birthday in 1945.
But with his name on it, Mansub is still alive.
The new vaccine system of cancer can train alien cells to 'see'
The new vaccine system of cancer can train and kill alien cells.
It helps the system to identify alien cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves removing and converting power from a patient into a lab.
Then they see a protein that is common to many cancers, and then they are reintroduced into the body.
This test vaccine is producing hopeful results in different types of cancers.
A woman who was treated with this vaccine had been missing for more than 18 months in her baby's womb.
In the process of removing the cells from a patient's strength barrier, converting them into a lab so that they can have a protein that is common in many cancers called HER2 "can see", and then these cells need to be reintroduced into the body.
Bethsda, in my country, U.S. National Cancer Institute Professor J. Brzefchi said: "Our results show that we now have a very hopeful vaccine.
Professor Brzhufki pointed out that HER2 "causes a lot of cancer" including skeletal, baby, frogs, and cancer.
The "training" of cancer cells to treat patients has also been successful in the treatment of the same kind of practical medication.
Wind West, after your SNL operation, the MAGA hit-putting tempo series
It's not good to do that!
The U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he praised the U.S. campaign, said that they would fight again for the election of president in 2020 after the public protests against the West during the time of S.D.N.O.S.O.S.O. during the trial, the public expressed dissatisfaction.
This night, his third song, which Ghost Town said after presenting, in which he was wearing a large American cloth, he reassembled his support against the Democrats.
"When you speak to a white man, they say, 'How can we like the trumpet? He's a descendant.'
He said, "Yes, if I were concerned about the tribe of Pakistan, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago."
SNL began with a socket with the Met Daemon, in which Hallwood Star, in front of the Court Committee of the Bart Cavano Court, laughed at the sexual harassment of Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not designed, the West's greenery was uploaded to social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock wants to fake the West through this post.
Besides, West complained to the public that he had to face a difficult time after the stage because of his hat.
"They threatened me after the stage.
They said, "Do not go with him to the point of the furnace."
They threatened me!
According to Washington Agamaner, he told me then he told me I'm in a crash place."
The West said, "You want to see a spot?" He said, "He'll put on his superior hat, because that means you can't tell me what I'm going to do. Do you want to grow the world?
Try love."
Vrity magazine reported that because of his comments, the public expressed their discontent at least twice, and SNL officials were concerned, one person told the magazine: "The entire studio was completely silent."
The West was taken as an alternative to the glorification of Ariana Grand, previously known as Fred Ripper McMur a few days ago.
West put many of his songs ‘I’m in love with him’, dressed as a parier bottle.
West had the support of Candis Turner, the leader of the standing protest group TPUSA, who tweeted: "Peace to one of the most encouraging spirits: Thank you for fighting Hughum."
But Tak Shu's host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just expressing his personality, and it's absolutely amazing.
"But I chose not to reward a person (to buy his music or his clothes or to support his "phen") who I think is coming forward with a view that is bad for my community.
He's free.
So are we." He added.
Before Shu, Ripper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name and now "is going to be officially known as the Kenyan West."
He's not the first fan to change his name, and he's walking on the map of Daddy, who's going to go by the name of PFD, PFP, and PD.
The companion Ripper was Sunup Doug's name was Sunup Line, and the previous Legend Prince of Music probably changed his name into a symbol.
The charge of attempted murder at the Ballast Restaurant
On the day of Thursday in East Belfast, a restaurant accused a 45-year-old man of trying to kill a man in a man's room.
The police said it was in Bali's office.
The case is expected to be brought to the Supreme Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Service.
The star of the Game of Thrones was severely criticized by the brave man of Cut Harrington.
Cut Harrington HBO is known for the role of a sword-playing player as the anti-violent imaginary game of throns in the ear of June.
But the 31-year-old official strongly criticized the hero's violent behavior on screen and said that the role of the screen is that young people often feel that they will have to be hard for a powerful addition.
Speaking to The Sanda Times, Cut said they understood 'something was wrong' and asked how to deal with the problem of a female man away in #MeToo.
Cutt, who recently married her playmate of Thrones, Lielie, aged 31, admitted that they are very serious about preparing this issue.
He said, "I am personally concerned about where we have made a mistake in promoting the French man."
What do we teach men when they were growing up, about the problem we're seeing now?
Cutt believes that TV television can be responsible for the development of the ferocious man of the Persian Empire because of its very ment worshipers.
They said, ‘Is there a creation and is [not] manifest?’
What's taught on TV, and in the throats, kids feel that they're going to have to take a specific attitude to be dead.
I think it's a big question of our time. How do we change this behavior?
Because it's clear that there's something wrong with the training of young men."
They also admitted in the interview that in the next winter, when the game of throns is over, they won't be able to spend more like that because they've been driven by the field of war and horses.
A film producer and his brother from November, who will be shown in the Rehabilitation of Sem Shefard, based on the story of a Doko, will be released in the wake of the True West.
The editor recently expressed the truth that they believe that meeting their wife with the day is a good gift to meet them from Game of Thrones.
He said, "I found this with my wife, so she gave me my future family and a new life ahead of her.
The day played the role of a lover of Cut's role in the imaginary environment that receives the M.E.A.
In June 2018, he was tied to a marriage bond on the family camp of Lezili in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Doctors have reported that more than 820,000 people in the country are affected by it.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second month of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been affected by sexual relations, which is against the tradition of the past.
Traditionally, in some parts of China, HlV is rapidly spreading through blood transfusions.
In a conference in Greece, however, Chinese medical practitioners said that the number of people affected by HIV has dropped by almost zero.
However, the number of AIDS and AIDS cases in China has reached 100,000 over the years
The transfer of HIV through sexual relations is a serious problem in the LGBT community of China.
In China, our gender was considered intolerable in 1997 but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is still common.
Because of the country's continuing status, the studios have found that 70-90 percent of men who have sexual relations with men are married to women.
Most cases of these diseases are caused by improper sexual protection in such relationships.
In order to address this problem, the Chinese government has promised access to HIV medicines from 2003 to HIV.
Maxine Waters revised their staff to read the GOP Senator's data, a heavy condemnation of 'dangerous lies' and 'serious ideas'.
Mexican Weathers accused the week of charges by US EW representatives that one of their actions had published personal information of three Republican senators on the one Paddy pages of legal structures.
From Los Angeles, Democrat Kinn insisted that such claims are made by the posters and websites of "the most right arms".
In a story on Twitter, Waters said, "This is all a lie, a lie, and a more serious lie."
The reported information includes the names and phone numbers of London Graham and Mike of Utah from South Carolina, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah, Utah,
Information gathered online, which was published during the hearing of the Senate panel on charges of sexual abuse against Bret Kiwano by a member of the Supreme Court of the U.S. Capitol Hall.
This information has been leaked after some time of ignoring Kiwano from the senators.
Hall reported on permanent sites such as the Gateway Pandt and Red State, that the posts are linked to the IP address vendor's office, and that an inventory of the activities of the Weathers has been reported.
Vatres added that this baseless charge is completely wrong and a obvious lie.
The detainees of my work, whose identity, personal information and protection have been threatened by these deceptive and false accusations, are not responsible for any of the following.
This baseless charge is a completely wrong and obvious lie.
Winds' account was immediately checked online, including the former press secretary Air Philistia of the White House.
Physer wrote that this is a modern-day rage.
It turns out that he doesn't have the privilege of holding the Congolese.
When accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They should not be fooled.
They don't have to ask the defendant's intention.
So let them be at ease, and let them be at ease.
It seemed that the counter-responsibility of the Flyer Weathers was being compared to the democratics' review of the trial on Kivano, and the Nazis accused him of being very angry during the hearing of the events on Kivano.
In the mid-term elections, the Republican Republican hopeful old Nevaro also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
They tweeted, "If you are telling the truth, tell us the truth."
In his statement, Vatres said that his office had distorted the laws and morals of the law regarding these deceptive charges.
They also said, "We will make sure that the responsible people are brought to the public and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful to any of my actions."
Johnny English Strikes Again – The World of Unsearchable Roan Atkinson · Global Voices
It has now become a tradition that any British point of view can be seen about the importance of the billing, but this is not true of this update of Johnny English's Action Comrade's E.M.F.F., which began in 2003 and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a new opportunity to expose this people, created personal strings on this article, how many of us clearly we are a coward?
In any case, the eyes went out and the face of the frog had a license to refresh things another time -- and that its signs are a major piece of art that is prepared for areas that are not English-speaking or English-speaking.
He's probably a crazy secret agent who, despite his amazing design, has a few features of the class within him, Mr. Byn's honor, and London's 2012 Olympics celebration, only one of the leading figures of the Chariots of Fire.
Its role is based on the international passenger and the international person who ever entered the Barcelona Card's TV news and left behind an affidavit.
This latest J.E. is one or two good times.
I found myself in the gold of the Young English Coron Centre and moved to a heli copter with his coat of arms.
Atkinson is on display for the physical comedy, but in the game he is not alive, and in a strange way he sees the design, especially the "synthetic" film brand like 007 and Mission Nexus are now offering the game with confidence as a single piece.
It's funny that it's for young children instead of adults, and I don't have the young English characters that are as old and modern as those of Attanson's silent characters.
Now, the permanent region's fate is that Britain is in serious concern.
A cyber hacker has entered the most secret web network of spies, and all British agents in the field have now become a source of pain for the agent on duty, which is very sad for Kwan Elden.
It's the last thing for a superintendent who's a weak-hearted person of beauty, who's already caught up with a complete political reputation.
Their intelligence consultants tell us that because every active spy is in danger, they will have to bring someone back.
And that means to bring the wrongs to the English language, which is now a school master in a covered area, but a student's team of the record team offers: In some places it's hard to stop laughing because Johnny's school of rock is running an Academy of Arts.
Johnny is brought to the White Hall for a hungry buffing and reunited with his former long-term companion Bough, who is paying the bills.
Bo is now a married man, all my commandant, the role of a July Hake Stox, in which Vicki Paperin is a little worthless.
So, in the secret service of the Queen of Great Britain, the auction is coming back to oblivion of the kinds of beta-min and rubbing things, in which the beautiful month of the East Korean is in front of Ofilia Boltupa.
There's a dangerously dangerous magic on the part of Antanaya, the deputy leader of the Arab Party, who claims to be able to solve the concerns of the British computer: Manhus Jensen Wolta, who plays the role of Jack Lise.
Johnny and Boo start their story with their musical colors; they set fire to a French restaurant in the windmill; they combine themselves into the Volta's protease ship; and Johnny English makes a fuss when he tries to use the Verchoel Realty headset to get acquainted with the interiors of the Wolta's home.
All the time has certainly been saved for this last thing, but the fun and the fun of this game, the whole movie looks like you're watching children's TV.
There's enough middle-class content.
And as with the other films in Young English, I always have to think, "Can't the British film industry give Rovan Atkinson any role to be fair with his ability?"
The Libre Party has warned that it is planning for British citizens to work four days a week, but pay five days a week.
Jeremy Corbin's libertarian party is looking at a revolutionary plan under which British citizens will work four days a week, but they will be paid five days.
According to the news, the party wants to release the rest of its employees from the company by releasing an additional day of creative intelligence (WD) from the rest of the company.
Under it, work will be fun with one and a half days -- but the house will be taken as soon as possible.
Media said that this idea would be 'museum' for the party's executive agendas and plans that want to move the country towards employees.
Trade Union Congo, on the move to the four-day week, has confirmed that it is possible to benefit users from the changed economy.
A Senior Media of the Liber Party told The Sande Times: What is expected to happen before the release of police opinion before the end of the year
It won't be a night like that, but the four-day week of the car is a movement that is appropriate for the company's collective industrial wisdom practice, as well as for the rest of the company's workers.
The Liber Party is not the first party that has confirmed the idea, but Green Party promised a week for the 2017 general election.
However, the libertarian party generally does not support this idea.
One translator of the Liber Party said: four days a week is not a car party policy, and the party is not under consideration.
Chancellor John McDonald used the libertarian conference last week to present his idea of a socialist revolution in society.
Mr. McDonald said that they are determined to take power back from the 'external-faced directors' and the proponents' in the U.S. companies.
The chancellor of the HZB disagreement also means that the current shipowners in the water companies will not be able to get their full share back because the liberating government can 'cut' because of the misconception that the liberating government is making.
They also confirmed the intention of the employees to include in the company's boards and to allocate 10 per cent of the private shares to the company's shares to the government, which would provide employees with an annual profit of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Candy's 60-minutes, will research against the FBC's Kiwano change their mind?
The U.S.A.'s investigation into anti-J.B.A.E.'s attacks has delayed at least one week's final vote in the Supreme Court and asks whether the research of Beuro will force any Republican senators to take back their support.
In an interview that took place on Sunday, Scott Pile asked the Republican Senators Jan Candy and Lindsey Gharam if the FBI could find something that would encourage them to change their mind.
The Canadians saw a lot more awkward than they did with their fellows.
And Canada said, "I mean, sure."
I told you to go to court. I talked to Judge Kivano.
After the charges had been brought, I called Kivano and said, "What did you do?"
They were in a position of authority, and judgment, and two ways.
However, there's no clue in the order of Gharam.
He said that they had stopped their opinion about Brett Kiwano and needed a dynamites to change it.
I don't know what happened with Dr. Ford, but I do know that Brett has advanced from his strength to Christine Blossom.
No soul can confirm what it has named.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see any big changes.
What's Global Sitizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On this week, New York will host the Global Sitizen Festival, which is the annual music festival, where many well-known globarians show their imagination and are as impressive as their mission -- the end of global poverty.
In their seven years, thousands of people will gather in the Grand Lane of Central Park in the Global Sitting Festival, not only to enjoy the glaucoma of Gent Jackson, Cardie Be, and Shan Mands, but also to warn of his real commitment to end severe poverty by 2030.
Global City Festival, launched in 2012, is a global poverty project that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of active people working against poverty.
A free ticket (if you want to pay for an IP ticket) will complete a certain tax or "abilities" for the Consort public, such as volunteering, e-mailing a global leader, calling a phone, or raising awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful is the Global Sites in fulfilling their mission when only 12 years are left?
Is the idea of giving people free concerts a real way to convince people to take action, or is there another form of "Clicty Imam", which people think they're doing a lot of work by signing an online page or sending a tweet?
According to the Global Sites, since 2011, she has recorded 19 million "adolescents" of her males for the various requirements of adhesion."
According to him, they have encouraged global leaders to announce more promises and policies than $37,25 in excess of the dollar, which will improve the lives of people from 2030 to 2.25 in excess of the dollar.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 promises and announcements created by its activities, of which at least $10 billion have been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funding received has so far directly affected some 649 million people around the world.
Some of the important promises include the power of neutrons, which is a member of the British government's employees and proponents, and she's committed to "helping children with their full ability to breast-feed", she promised to provide $35 million to help end the food crisis in Rwanda after accepting 4 700 tweets from the Global Sites.
During a live concert in London in April 2018, Chief Tricy Almin of the Power of the Neutrons told Hugh that with the help of the British government, the governments, the national governments, and the global states like you, we can make a history of the social injustices of the food industry.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 demands for better food for mothers and children from Britain, the government announced a project to provide funding to the power of neutrons, under which 5 million women and children benefit from food needs.
One question on your website is, "What forces you to think that we can end severe poverty"
The Global Satellite said, "This is a long and difficult journey - we'll always fall and fail."
But, like activists against civil rights and racial prejudice, we are also successful, because together we are more powerful.
In New York this year's event, some of those who show their fiction include GENT Jackson, Weekend, Shan Mandys, Cardy Be, and Genele Mona, whose host will be Deborah Lee Francis and Heo Jack Minna.
To interfere with Russian energy outputs, the United States can use its own coast for 'Blacked'.
US Secretary-General Riuka has discovered, as Washington Ajamaner reported, that "if necessary," Washington Russia uses its sea to prevent energy from reaching the Middle East and the Middle East.
Jacky has accused the Russian occupation of finding new energy channels in the evening, and the country is under arrest at the invitation of the Russian evening government.
He said, "I think that the cause of their presence in the Middle East is to boost energy, as they are doing in Eastern Europe, which is the southern belly of Europe."
And with them are ways and means of meeting Him.
He said the United States has the ability to make sure sea routes are open, and if necessary, they will be closed so that their power will not reach the average.
Talking at a conference held by the Yankee Consignor Energy Alliance, this Alliance is a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of Twani users" in the United States.
He compared Washington's wise practice to deal with Russia and Iran, and it's possible that they're intertwined.
He referred to Russia as a "manipulative horse" whose livelihood depends on fuel maintenance, said the economic situation of Iran and Russia depends on less and more fuel and changes it.
These reports have come to light at a time when Europe is working on an increased mission to replace the Trump administration of Russia, which is the most stable option for European users.
In this regard, the promising sentiment of the Trump Administration itself is trying to convince President Donald Trump, Germany that it would be outlawed by the "outstanding" Nord Stream 2 pipe line, which has, according to the Trump, made Berlin a "asir" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that $11 billion of the dollar's logbook 2 pipeline, which will double the current pipe line's capacity to 110 billion m, is specifically a major project.
Kerimlan argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is just about making some of the most accurate reasons and is an example of non-innovative equation.
In September, after meeting with the US Secretary of Power in Moscow, Alexander Nouak of Russia said that I believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that users should be able to deal with suppliers.
Germany has strongly criticised the U.S. government and the project has renewed its commitment
Germany's first-class organization, the Federal of German Indians (BDI) said to the United States that it was far from two-sided agreements between U's powerful police and Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent visit by the Federal of Germany India (BDI) Director Kamp said after a recent visit between German Chancellor Angela Carl and Russian President Ledmer Puton, that I am very sad when a third country is in the service of our power.
Senator Elzabadani of Massachusetts says she will "constantly consider" when taking part in the presidential election in 2020
Senator Elzabadani of Massachusetts said that after the mid-term election, she would consider "synthetic" when taking part in the presidential election.
During a tunnel hall meeting in the region of Massachusetts, the people confirmed that they would consider taking part in the election
According to The Hall, he said it's time for women to move Washington and fix our corrupt government, and he needs a woman in power.
He said that after November 6, I will take serious consideration of the fight for the presidential election.
During the tunnel hall, President Donald Trump was severely attacked and said, "They're taking this country to the wrong direction.
He said, "I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy."
The government is strongly criticizing the Supreme Court for the terrorist attacks.
Agha on a tweet, the people said we definitely need an FB study before the vote.
However, a survey carried out by the agencies revealed that the majority of people in their polls felt that they should not take part in the 2020 poll.
According to Soffolk University's political research center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of the Massachusetts voters said they should not participate in the election.
Twenty percent supported the election.
Serbia has shown greater support for participation by former Governor Dwell Patrick, under which 38 percent supported possible participation and 48 percent opposed it.
Other high profile democratic names that are being discussed about taking part in the 2020 election are former Vice Presidents, who are members of the Benny and Vermont Center.
According to the essu-ed press, Byden said they'd decide on a regular basis until January.
Reference to PTSD of Trek Pilen in the relay of the Downdrop of Sara Pilen
Thirty-year-old Trek Pillen spent a year in Iraq after being filled in September.
He was arrested and sentenced on Monday night in an incident of domestic violence.
He told a Riley on the D.T.L.L.D. tour in the area of Oklahoma that after my son's situation, I could feel the pain of other families who suffer the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our troops bring back.
Pillen called his arrest "in the chamber in power" and said about his sons and other soldiers, "They come back a little bit different, they come back a little hard, they come back thinking that what they, their comrades, Armenians, and any other members of the army are doing for the country, is appreciated or not."
According to a translator of the Venezuelan Police Dan bint, the truck driver was arrested on Monday from the Elsca area of Venezuela and accused of armed domestic violence, domestic violence, and abuse as a result of attacks on a woman.
18 States Support to Challenge the New DC Security Policy
The state and district of Colombia have supported the legal challenge of the new US police, who refuse to protect refugees from domestic violence.
ABC News reported that representatives of the states and districts of the camps asked Amagha to challenge the police in Washington to support the police in support of the judiciary.
Grace Miglia Sessions, which the United States Civil Rights Union issued in August, did not reveal the full name of Dada against the police.
He said that his partner and "the sons of the members of his protest gangs" had abused him, but US promises refused his request for shelter on July 20th.
He was taken to Texas.
Greece's sponsors appointed El Salvador, Honduras, and Goti Mina as countries that are most in demand for U.S. asylum because these countries are facing major problems with crime and domestic violence.
The US's new policy on refugees 2014 is against the decision of the Board of Migrants Apples, which allowed unregistered Turkins to seek refuge from domestic violence.
Dark of Colombia's Tartar General Carl Reisin told Agaga in a statement that the new police "regards the hypocrisy, defamation and international law of many decades"
The court's request for assistance is stated that the case law requires that the decision of all asylum cases be taken on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and this policy is an infringement of this principle.
At the request, the prosecutors further argued that the police that prevented the entry of the Turkish country is harmful to the American community because such people can become workers and "provide large books"
Atarni General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration courts in June not to allow refugees from domestic abuse and gang violence to be further sheltered.
The sessions announced on 11 June to the police, saying that there is only shelter available for those who leave their country because of ethnicity, religion, nationality, or a particular social group or political opinion.
It was never meant to reduce all the problems -- even all the serious problems facing people all over the world.
Efforts to save the victims in Palo, double the number of casualties
The situation was worse for the survivors.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusoma, encouraged her son from a cave in a affected town in the city of Palo.
Every minute, there's an ambulance bringing the bodies.
Drinking water is the heart of the drinker.
Locals have been able to return to their ruined homes, which were trying to pick up wells in the water and what was left behind.
Hundreds of people have been injured and some of the hospital injuries affected by an earthquake of 7.5.
Two Harts, who had come to the room and the shed, were staying outside the hospital, including some injured Paulo soldiers, where patients were being treated outside the building due to quakes.
Her eyes began to see the sisters when she moved out of their hotel room on the fifth floor, where she was present with her wife and daughter.
He said, "There was no time for me to protect myself.
Hart told Esocy Att Press that I was stuck in the walls, and he added that he had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife running for help, but then silenced.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they'll be safe.
The United States Cyprus's 'Propaganda News' charges against 'warrants' in China
A U.S. newspaper in China reported that a week after reporting a four-page commercial profit in the US and China, the U.S. Sciphere in China accused the US press of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, after attempting to interfere with the US elections on November 6th, China referred to China Daily's most-selling newspaper, China, the most-selling thief in the Iva State.
Tramp's accusation that Binging is trying to interfere with the U.S. elections is a new stage in the growing pressure on China from Ashington, as US promises have told the writers.
Since it is common for non-governmental governments to announce trade promotion, there is a long-standing trade war between Bangladesh and Washington, in which they announced several rounds of traffic on each other's exits.
Chinese and American experts say that in the beginning of the commercial war, China's response to Terrence was to create a target for those who supported the Republican Party of Trump, such as Eva.
In China, the former long-term governor and Chinese governor of the US Sapphira and Iva said that Banjang has damaged US workers, farmers and business leaders.
Brenstad wrote in a column in the Deis Mines Registry on Sunday that China is increasing the propaganda in our free press by increasing this threat.
Brenstad wrote that in spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government announced that it was taking advantage of all American freedom and freedom of expression.
You will be able to hear limited voices against the government on the new flag in China, and you will not see the true reflection of the Chinese people's political turmoil in China, because the media Chinese Communist Party is in possession of China.
He added that one of China's most well-known news headlines hit the news offer, but he didn't tell us what the news was.
Investigators have warned that the Republicans are depriving women of the vote before the mid-term election.
As many Republicans are defending the British Supreme Court against a number of allegations of sexual harassment, investigators have reported that they will face its reaction in the middle of the election, especially by women.
The feelings from that reference are very high, and more Republicans have shown that they want to comment on it.
A professor of political science at the University of Surakios told The Hall about an article published on the week that you cannot ignore.
Reyn said they don't believe that Senator Jeff Fly (Arrisona) will be enough to satisfy the demand for F.B.I. investigation in the late days.
According to Washington D.C., national interpreters and senior consultant Karen Jean Pierre said that women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it in the next few days and November.
Mac reported that on Thursday morning, protesting in the Senate depot, the audience pointed out that "Number is coming!" The scene was when the republishers, who controlled the judicial committee, decided to continue the banning of Kivano despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
A non-partisan political investigator, Stan Nwynberg, told the news site that the Democrat spirit and movement would be unexpected.
They say, "It is the most exalted and the most trustworthy".
But these feelings can be even higher, especially in the case of Swiss women and young women, in the 18 to 29 years old voters, who often do not vote because they hate the president.
Prior to Ford's public testimony, in which he presented details of charges against the Supreme Court's criminal justice, investigators suggested that it would have a severe reaction if the Republicans decided to continue the vote.
According to NC News, a former member of the Republican National Committee, Charmaine Michael Steel said it became a source of encouragement for G & P.
Priorities USA, a group that assists in the selection of democracies, director Cesol told the New Channel that the problem is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or the election of Kivano in the bank, but also how the Republicans dealt with the problem and how they dealt with it.
However, after the testimony of Ford and Kiwano, it seems that the Americans have become convinced of who to be trusted, while the recent report has little benefit.
A new poll by YouGov revealed that 41 people believe in Ford's testimony, or maybe it's true, when 35 percent said it was true, or maybe it's true.
In fact, 38 percent said that they believe that Kivano probably lied during the testimony, when only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The Guardian reported that after Flying's request, F.B.I. is currently investigating charges against at least one other D.D.O. Ramirez, except for Ford.
Ford explained to the Senate's judicial committee that Kivano abused him at the age of 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court of exposing his shame to him during a party in Yell in the 1980s.
Plan to start a new internet with Google and Facebook on the World Wide Web
The World Wide Web is planning to start a new internet against Tom Burnsley Google, Amazon, and Facebook.
The latest project of technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on the open source plate form solid of Burnsley.
Solid allows users to know where their data is stored and to know who is allowed to access.
In a special interview with the Feast Company, Burnsley said in a joke that Inrupt's goal is "public power"
They said: "We shall certainly do it."
It's a historic moment.
This app uses solid technology to facilitate the creation of its "participating online data store" or a POD
It includes a list of contacts, a list of activities, calendars, music libraries and other personal and front translation tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Output Book, Salka and Spatifi at a time on a browser.
What's unique about the personal online data store is that the user has the option to access which kind of information they can access.
The company calls it "personal authority through data"
According to the company's e-mail and John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company will collect resources, methods and appropriate equipment for each of them.
At the time, the company Burnsley, Bruce, was bought by IBam, a security plait farm that was placed on the focus of the project is a community of on-staff developers and volunteers.
From this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own centralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.

Bernard Van: A ceremony at the honour of the minister who won the Victoria Cross in the first major war
During the great first war, the only church that won the Victoria Cross of England celebrated a 100-year celebration in their home town.
Lieutenant Colonel Rand Bernard Van won this award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellingley and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a print hit and never found out that he had won the highest honor of the British army.
On the day of the week, two of his gates in the area of the Northampton Sheir spread a memorial stone during a parade.
One of their grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was a "wonderful symbol" that this stone appeared 100 years after his grandfather's avalid use.
According to London Gajit, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van took his battalion through the De St.
Then he quickly moved to the firing line and led a field number alone and three detachments ahead of his line, with "greatest strength".
Lieutenant Colonel Van killed a German press officer just a month before the end of the war on October 4, 1918.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's tools were never met, but he was a humble national service.
After the press, he and his brother, Dr. James Wen, placed the flower cover under the leadership of Burntwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wan said that they feel the honour of participating in the press, and "a demonstration of the strength of a real hero is being supported by many people."
Imm.A.'s public billet 206 was found in the night, instead of the pepa pupa.
Imagine that you're a little busy watching a 206 billature all night just because you're being kept away from the central unit.
There were 13 matches on San José's ticket, including six matches on the man card that were being shown directly on channel 5 at night in Britain.
At 6:00 a.m., just as the Guardians Mosesse and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British officials were shocked when the Quarge Papa Pag changed.
There were some who were awake in the morning,
One of the public on Twitter has set up a "one kind of stupid joke" to be transferred to children's cards.
When asked about the media, the vice-president, Vice-Chairman of Bilatour's marketing and entertainment, said that it was the government's opinion that this was not appropriate for the 6th of the morning, so they had to move to the children's programmes.
Yes, "Papa The Pug."
Billour Company President Scott Kokker said he is working on his system to include British officials in the future
And Corporal said, "I think when we think about RI, I think we might be able to figure it out."
But there's six o'clock in the morning and we're not going to be able to do it in our time on Sundays, Mondays.
But we're working on it.
Make sure that when it changed, a lot of text messages were received and they weren't all friendly.
We're trying to fax it, we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, but it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't be like that.
We're going to make five matches instead of six -- as we usually do -- we're trying to get more fun for the public, and we won't find it.
This is a desperate situation.
Desert's Island Desk: Tom Delhi was aware of being 'reduced' because of his personality
Olympics Daeley says he grew up with a sense of self-esteem -- but he moved him to become a successful man.
Alice, aged Tom, said she didn't realize until she went to high school that "no one was like me."
Speaking on the director's radio 4 from Lauren Lauren, Iland Disks, he told others that they are talking about the rights of the kind of fans.
He said that as a father, they were worried about winning the Olympics.
For a long time, the usual representative of Shu's, Christy Young, has been released for several months because of his illness.
As a result of the first wave of Lauren's program, Dale said that he grew up with the feeling that he was "less" than everyone else because it was not socially acceptable for boys and girls."
He told me, so far, the feelings of being less and the feelings of being different gave me the strength and the ability to succeed.
He told me he wanted to prove that he was "something" because he didn't despair when he finally found out about his personality.
In Olympics, a two-time winner of cossis, LGBT, has become a senior employee of a find, and this year, he has appealed to more countries in the White Games of Work in Australia to encourage our kind of forgiveness.
She said she was clearly speaking because she felt happy that she was able to live without a stranger, and she wanted to "hope" others.
The three-time World Cup said that a man, American filmmaker Deston Lance Blade, with whom he met in love in 2013, was amazing for him.
Dilly married Escher Edward Duston, who is 20 years older than he was, last year, but never made a difference in age.
He said that when you were so young, he went to Olympics for the first time in 14 years and died three years later because of his father's cancer -- he said he was hard to find someone of his age who had seen so high.
This couple in June, Robert Ray-Dili, became the parents of a black-diliary son, and Daily, said that he changed his mind about his life.
He said: If thou hadst spoken to me a year ago, thou wouldst have surely made me a goldsmith.
Do you know that the Olympics are bigger than winning gold?
I'm a gold hummingbird.
His son's name is his real father Robert, who died of brain cancer at age 40 in 2011.
Dale said that he didn't accept that he was going to die, and the last thing he asked was if he got a ticket for London in 2012. Because he wanted to be in the next row.
He said, “I did not tell them that you will not be able to stay in the next row.”
He said: "I had grasped their hand when he took the last breath, and I stayed with them until the last breath, and finally I realized that he was not able to take it."
The following year, Delhi took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the Prize for the Consciousness.
He told me that I only knew that I had seen her all my life in a dream -- putting a fountain in a Olympic game in front of the Home Cloud. There was no better feeling than that.
He's also moved to choose his first song -- by Proud from Somalia -- who was gurgling in his mind during the preparation of the Olympics, and still stands up his roulettes.
Desert's Iland Desk is presented on British radio 4 according to British time.
The output of Form McClane was added to the reader's copy every week.
American Phil McClane will set up a record on Sunday when they play their 47th Reader Cup match, but they will have to restore their platform to avoid creating an unpleasant mail.
Malason, who is playing 12 times a record against every six months, has been included on the day of the week by Captain Sam Farok for both Bals and Quick Sams.
Instead of becoming the focus of people's eyes, which is mostly for the Americas, five-time champions of the championship, Malason, who played his day to play a career leader and to work on his game to eliminate his weaknesses.
They can't even throw straight into their careers, so the 48-year-old player is not fit for a national golf course, where the long-term country is punishing bad shots.
And although the course is not so difficult as it is, on the weekend, Malchon will be with the British Open Campion Francisco millery, who, along with Tommy Flatwood, live their four matches together this week.
If the Americans, who are at the beginning of the 12 major matches, lose four points at the start of the race, they can be very important to the McClane's match.
Farok expressed confidence in his player.
Fir'awn said: verily he considereth his work to-day. And he scuttled me, and cast his hands round me, and said: verily he shall be ready to-morrow.
He has full confidence in himself.
He's a fan of popularity, and in the past, and this week he gave these teams a lot.
I probably didn't think she'd play two matches.
I had more imagination than that, but what was going to happen was, and maybe we thought so.
Like any other player, he wants to be in the field.
He'll break the record of playing the best record of the best record ever.
It could end up with his reader's cup career, but it doesn't match his personal record heights.
Malason has successfully scored 18 times, 20 times failure, and seven times the score, although Farok said his presence gave him a lot of fun for the team.
He explained that he likes to break up with people and the team's room life.
I think young players enjoy it, and it's been a really fun week.
There's more to it than playing.
European Coptan Thomas Beerin knows the big ice can soon end.
Europe's Captain Thomas Beerin knows from his experience that a lot of ice can easily be turned into a big deal of trouble in the late days of the Reader Cup.
The Danish player started his career in 1997 in Valdrama, where a team in the Cé Balestros's corporation had a top five points on the Americans, but when they reached the finish line they succeeded with a very tight margin of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
He said, "You're reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Oldrama, we had a big one in Baroque line, where we were beaten and we lived in Oldrama, but with a very small margin.
So history told me and the team that the case is not over.
Today, full preparation goes into the field tomorrow.
They're doing everything right there.
The word doesn't end until you get a point on the board.
We have one goal, and he's to win it, and our whole focus is on it.
I always said that I focus on 12 players on my side, but we are well aware that on the other hand, our opponent is the best players in the world.
Glad for the work of his players on a hard golf course, Warren said more: I never made it quick.
Tomorrow we're going to get hit by a different storm.
There will be personal work yesterday, which will be obvious, and this is a different thing to do.
It's nice to be in the field with a partner when you're in the situation, but when you're there alone, then your full capacity as a golfer is tested.
It's just a message that you have to fully prepare the players and take advantage of their full capacity.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and you have to go and show your full capacity.
By contrast, opposition numbers are expected to show better behaviour against their players than the two players, besides Jordan Spath and Joton Thomas, who took three out of four.
Farok himself remained on both sides of these unexpected changes of the last day, after being part of the Battle Team in the Baroque line, when the European team won the "Medina's Award".
When he was asked how he became a cop in 1999, how his players were taken to the last day, he said, "I remember every word of it."
We're going to have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you're going to want to get to this fast start as you saw in the baroque line, as you saw in the Medina.
When she's on one side, she puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the balls.
And We have arranged for him a line of custom, and We will surely make of him the enchanters.
Thomas has been charged with a response charge, and against him will be with other Europeans in the dock with Rory McMalay and Paul Cassie, Gutton Day, John Ramme, Tommy Flatwood and Inn Potter and Line App.
Burne said about her passions, "I put my players in this order because I think it's all about the game.
A new warship in Germany was reunited
The German Navy's new frigate was scheduled to take place in 2014, but this may not be as low as the next year, according to local media, it is the result of a lack of systems and Hossorba.
Di Zeit reported to a military translator that the first ship to be prepared for the new band-wurtmburg class was now linked to the decline of the Rhine Falls.
This ship was supposed to join the sea in 2014, but after Delirium's disturbing problems, the U.S. project has been damaged.
The four ships of the band-wurtburg class, which the commander of the Navy gave in 2007, will take over the frigids of the former Bremen class.
It is believed that on these ships a powerful roof, aircraft of different types, and aircraft of different types, will be equipped with satellites, such as readreaders, infrareds and satellites.
Other important features include the longer periods of Mentinus -- what newest frigates can be set away from their home port for two years.
However, Dai-Zit has pointed out that in these modern warships, the constant delay will lead them into service as soon as they enter the service. It is said that this will enable Germany to display its power across the sea.
Less than F125 Friday last year came in the mines when the German Navy refused to land the ship on a regular basis and sent it back to Hemburg to Bloom & Wis Shop Yard.
It's the first time that the sea has returned to a ship after Delirium.
There was little information about the reasons for this return, but the German media referred to "saveware and hardware's many heavy targets" that would make the warship useless if it was assigned to a horrific mission.
The software industry was particularly important because the band-wurtmburg class's fleets had to operate only 120 sailors' operations, which is about half of the human strength on the old Bremen class's ships.
It was also noted that the weight of the sea was too much, which limits the ability to add an app grids to the future for the sea.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of tons of live land beans used by Germans in the second major war are twice the weight of the ships of the same class.
In addition to poor hardware, the entire project's logistic work has also become a problem.
Its legacy is said to have reached the sum of more than 2.2 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the original.
New Fridays are increasing in the light of recent developments in the face of problems, which are increasing in the light of the German sea power.
In the beginning of this year, the German parliament's defence committee chief Hans Peter Butles admitted that the sea is a threat to the lack of passengers to be assigned.
The pledge said that in time the problem was serious, because the old ships were completed, but their new ships were not provided.
They expressed regret that the band-wurtmburg class could not be included in a frigid bay.
Research on the Secret Life of National Trusts
The aim of a new study conducted in a Scottish Highland newspaper is to find out how insects use natural sights to find food.
It is hoped that its results will bring new light to the behaviour of these pets and provide guidance for future protection activities.
The National Trust for Scotland's scientists include long-haired hearings and duplicating candles, as well as common and sparano-papis trilis, in the research conducted in the western streets of Western Europe.
Special records will be held in all areas to stimulate the activity of bulbs throughout the weather
HlS will be able to use mobile phones and volunteer manuals.
A survey of the sound of all the recordings will reveal the ficcoins and what kinds of chemists are doing.
To prepare a detailed picture of their behavior, a map and a report of the birth boom will be prepared.
For the N.T.S., D.O., natural protection consultants were hoping that the results would show what is most important and how they are used for all kinds of plants.
This information will help to determine the management of the boom, such as for bulbs and related species, and to determine the benefits of maintaining forests.
During the last century in Scotland and Britain, there has been a marked decline in the habitats of bats.
Their populations are threatened by construction and growth that affects their habitats and their natural habitats.
In addition to wind-powered turbines and lights, some chemical gases and plant materials are also dangerous to them.
The light bulbs are not actually dark.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch a prey.
She uses a scientific single-location technique to detect worms and obstacles in her flight path.
The TS, which is responsible for the care of the land, is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 37 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, taking the light bulbs very seriously.
He has ten trained experts who regularly conduct interviews, assess homes, and assist.
It is the first and only house in the Treasury state of Scotland, in Dmfres and Gloves, in which there are eight species of Scottish light bulbs.
State manager David Thompson said the state has a better place for them.
He said there's a great place for light bulbs here in Treve.
We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and a lot of fruit.
But many things about light bulbs that can't yet be known, so what we're doing here or elsewhere will help us to understand what they need for their expansion.
He insisted that prior to the construction of Mintennis, it is necessary to find out what was going on in the buildings, because it is possible that up to 400 women and children could be killed by destroying a shell in an engineering plant, possibly a complete local population.
The light bulbs are protected and it is illegal to destroy them, to threaten them or to harm them or to destroy their homes.
The Scottish officer Elizabeth Freel of the Bet Conzerwon Trust has encouraged the public to help.
They said: "We know very well what will happen to the fire, and we do not know what is the state of its inhabitants.
Ronaldo's charges of sexual abuse were raised, while the prosecutors would appeal against the German jury.
Cristino Ronaldo has called the allegations of sexual abuse against himself "a little news" and said that people want to know and use its name.
His assistants will file a case against Dor Espagli, who published the charges.
An American woman, Kathryn Mae Yurga, claimed that she was kidnapped by a Portuguese influence in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Dar Espegel reported to Agaga that Ronaldo was charged with paying the katherine $375.000 to keep quiet about the event.
After a few hours of reporting on the case, the Instagram Live Radio spoke to its 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronalds dismissed the news as a "kowti news".
He said, "No, no, no, no."
Five times Balon D.O. told the camera that what they're saying is "new news".
They want to be known for using my name.
It's a normal thing.
They want to be known by my name, but that's what happens.
laughing, he added, "I'm a happy man, and everything's going well.
According to the reporters, Ronaldo's prosecutors are preparing to file a case against Dar Espigla, which they have designated as "an inconsistency of psyche in the face of life".
Lawyer Crescian Hortz said that Ronaldo "will claim to do everything according to the serious nature of the violation, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the incident occurred in a room at Palles Hotel and Kisino in Las Vegas on June 2009.
According to a paper posted in Clark County Court in Nevada, after visiting a Knight Club, Ronald and May Yurgo apparently went back to the squares in Rome, where he apparently increased sexuality with him.
May Euroga claimed that, after the apparent incident, Ronaldo sat on his heels and told him that he "99 percent" was a "the first man" but "one percent of the evil" he was defeated.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he had a sexual relationship, but it was a mutual agreement.
May Yurga also claimed that she went to the police and took pictures of her wounds in the hospital, but later she agreed to correct the outside of the court because she was "feared by prosecution" and worried about "the general humiliation".
The 20-year-old Yorga says she wants to end this diagnosis because she's in constant terror because of the apparent incident.
In the wake of the apparent attack, Ronaldo Manquist was going to join the Real Madrid instead of the United, and the Italian club was transferred to Juve with 100 million Euros in the summer.
Newsletter: As British officials, ‘I’ll regret’ the lack of a job.
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that Britain would be sorry if he lost the status of a global prisoner in post-crisis post-crisis.
They also said, "It's cool," that tweeta Yoo told his wife that if she leaves Britain without a deal, she'll temporarily stop her production in the factory near the hospital in Bryanston.
Mr. Clark said we need a deal.
The Japanese car company said that jobs will be affected by the effects of border delay without a deal.
The Brentton Planner - created by Auris and Avensis in tweets - has produced some 150,000 jobs last year, with 90 percent of the remaining European Union being released.
The manager of Twitter's manager Maron Cook in Brenston said that my point is that if we leave at the end of Britain's March, there will be a period of fertility in our factory.
Other British car companies, including Honda, Beam Dubli, and Gagawarland Roor, have expressed concerns about how trade across borders would be done without an agreement.
For example, B.M.D. says that after a month's checkout, Oxford will shut down its mine.
Officials say more concerns are related to the dangers of high-speed China in the absence of a dealer's ticket.
Twitter's production line runs on the basis of the 'Ber Time-Fahami', which allows the British and U-Spliers to arrive within 37 minutes for the cars under the order.
If March 29 comes out of the UK with no deal, there may be a breach on the border, which may delay or diminish the party's distribution.
The company says that it will not be possible to have more money than the one-day price in your Drove share plan for Twitter, so the fruit will have to be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that for the future relationship with the Trisa month E.U., the Chequeirs Plan "is prepared to avoid these standards across the border"
We're going to have to make a deal, they told the two-way radio 4 program that we want a better deal to help us get through the current situation, but take full advantage of it.
Not just Twitter, but other manufactors' testimony is that we're going to have to be able to maintain our very successful expansion China completely.
Twitter was about to tell us how long the crop will be stopped, but notices that long-term growth in incomes will decrease the plant's equivalent and the final jobs will be affected.
Peter Sourres, who has been working in Burnston for 24 years and who is a United Assembly on the planet, said that he is very concerned about it: never get back in my experience when it's over.
A government translator said, "We have presented a fair and reliable plan for our future relations with EU
White House says it might be late again for the meeting with Rosenstein.
The White House told the weekend that the duplicity of Donald Trump's duplicating General Red Rosenstein's "can be delayed one and a week" while still being harassed by the Supreme Court's Chief Justice, Judge Brett Kwano.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Agent Robert Molar, who is investigating the possible interference between the Russian elections, the members of the troupe, and between the Russians and the President in justice.
Whether or not the Temppe duplicity of the Atarini General will be put at risk by the Molar's automaton, which has been the subject of a shop in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein thought it would be a trade to record the conversation with Trump and to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein revised this report.
But last Monday, he went to White House despite his firm's announcements.
Instead, an announcement was made to the organizers with Trump, who were present in the United Nations at the time in New York.
Trump said they wouldn't prefer to extract the day-to-day Stein, but then the Senate's Jewish committee closed the meeting to avoid the crime, both of whom testified to the testimony of Kevin and another woman, Dr. Christine Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Thursday, Trump ordered a week's F.B.I. investigation to investigate complaints against Kuwait, which resulted in further delay in the vote of the Senate.
The press secretary Sarah Sanders Fox News came on Saturday.
When asked about the meeting of daily Stein, he said, "There's no date for it, it could be that week, with other things going on in the Supreme Court, I can see that it's going to take another week.
But we'll look at it, and I'd like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters will reject the claim: Sanders hasn't printed in the White House since 10 September.
Mesban Chris Wallace asked why.
Andres said, "Even though Bryphonich's lack was not due to the unhappiness of the te reporters, I won't deny the fact that they understand."
Then they decided that there would be a direct link between the term and the press.
They said, "The Lord has given us more questions than the previous one. We have seen their number."
And Sanders said, "I'll still be there, but if the press has a chance to ask straight questions from the president of the United States, it's probably better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it, and you've seen us do it in the past few weeks, and when you talk to the president of the United States, it's going to take the press office.
When the White House was released, or when the press conference was open or was held with open sessions, or while attending the press conference, the members ask questions on a regular basis.
The only press conference is very well known.
In New York this week, the president probably pointed out why there is a different type of presence in front of the rapporteurs who have been gathered.
Health Secretary wrote a letter to European Union workers about the fear of Brexit in NHS Scotland
Health Secretary has written a letter to thank the country and to show the wish for a position in Scotland's NHS after the election.
Jan Freeman MSP wrote when the European Union of Britain spent less than six months in coal mines.
The Government of Scotland has expressed its commitment to meeting the demands of the European Union citizens who are already working in the advanced public service.
In his letter, Mr. Ferman wrote: "The heats continue to play between Britain and the European Union, whose decision is expected to take place in this winter
But the British government is also in the process of speeding up preparations to deal with a situation that is impossible.
I know this is a time of great concern for you all.
That's why I want to make it a point to take a look at the people of the work, how much I value the role of every restraint.
European Union and foreign workers bring extra-cost experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit patients and communities that we serve

The Christian Abercrombie had to go through an American surgery after the head hit.
Tigger line of state tennis was hit by Christian Ebercromby on a day-to-day trip from the Vanderbolt Commodores during the match and then went through an American surgery after a break from 27-31.
The state's head coach Road Red told reporters that it took some time before the Hot Hof team.
Red said, "He came to one side and got upset there."
Trainers and medical personnel threw Ebracromby on the street before moving back and forth to take it back.
An official of state tennis told WSMV's crosshairs in Nash Well, Tennessee that the nurse of Ebracrombie had ended in the Wunder Balt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the nature of the storm" and state tennis is trying to find out when the storm occurred.
Ebracromby, a junior, is playing his first race with state tennis after the transfer from Alinoy.
Before leaving the game, he made five yesterday's techs that make 18 of his techs in the tunes.
More stamps will be used to buy property in Britain on non-national buyers
More stamp duty on non-national buyers will be allocated to buy property in Britain, which will be used to help homeless people under new tours (tory) plans
This step will disable the success of the carbines driver's young voice.
Stamp duty will be applied to those who are not paying taxes in Britain
The treasure is expected to get £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Three months today will announce that more stamps have been decided on buying property in Britain, which will be used to help homeless people.
This step will be seen as a reflection of the success of the campaign to provide a more stable home for young people in Kerami Karbins.
The stamp duty will be extended to individuals and entities who are not paying taxes in Britain, which will be used to promote the government's campaign against gold from there.
Circuit, which is an increase in the current stamp duty, has been used two years ago to buy high levels for other homes and buildings - up to three percent.
The treasure is expected to reach £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of the new property, built in London, is purchased by non-British people, and the first time it makes it difficult for home buyers to take a step on the market.
Many areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "beautiful cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
This new police force from Burrus Gensen came only two weeks after the request for a loss in stamp duty so that more young people could buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of buying land and not using it to increase property prices, and expressed a desire for the destruction of 16 houses in order to escape the "low house" in Britain.
JANAB KARABIN has announced a series of comprehensive reforms, including controls and "BanaKathi"
They want to give Kusalz more options to build a new house.
Mr. Mae said, "I said last year that I would dedicate my plan to the revitalization of the British dream - this life should be better for every new generation.
And that's what it means to fix the market for our toothy flat houses.
Britain will always feed those who want to stay here, work and live free.
However, it is not appropriate that it is as easy for those who do not live in Britain, as it is for non-national companies to buy homes like British citizens who work hard.
For many people, it's just a dream, and there's a low-golden thing in there."
Jack Ross: 'I have the ultimate goal of organizing Scotland'
Sunderland's master Jack Ross says that his "final purpose" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
Scott is facing the challenge of restoring the 42nd Eastern Club, which is now at least three points from the first position in League Un.
After taking St. Mirren to Scotland's Premiersp, this summer's heat stadium was released.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I was given a B-cap and just," Russia told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But Scottland grew up looking at Hampden with his father, and that's what drew me back.
However, this will only happen if I succeed in the club system."
In front of Russia as the manager of Sanderland, there are Dutch editors, David Moose, Sam Alardez, Martin and Neal, Roy Kein, Gus Poit, and Paulo de Kenio.
Alloa Athletic, quoted earlier, says they were not afraid to follow such famous names after taking the lead from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Then I'll be able to measure my success by saying, 'Can I take this club back to the Prime Minister's League?'
He said, "As for the building of this club and its facilities, it's probably in the Prime Minister's League."
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll figure out how successful I am if I can get the club back there."
After spending 15 months in the construction work of Stans and Hearts in Dumbarton, Russia has only been in its memento career for three years.
Then they saved Allah from going out and helped restore to third grade and saved St. Mary's coming out next year and added championship titles.
And Russia says that they feel more at ease than in the careers of their games in Chile, the Hartell Pol, the Falker, the St. Mary and the Milton Academy.
Remembering the maintenance of Allah's movement, he said, "It was a thief in the real sense.
I really thought that the memento was best for me than to play."
It's strange because I played the right game, earned a lot of money and enjoyed a high standard life.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a number of things you need to do on a weekly basis.
As long as there's mental tension and pressure from work, I still have to face them, but I think the memento is appropriate.
I wanted to be always organized, and now I'm doing it, as much as I've spent my life in adolescence, I think it's more comfortable than all my life.

One survey found that the best time for drinking is 5:30.
The heat wave of the weather has increased the sale of low-voltage British pebs, but has also increased the pressure on restaurants.
The figures show that in July the sales of Pebs and Bar Group saw a 2.7 percent increase - but in restaurants it decreased to 4.8 percent.
This data-gathering business consultant, Peter Martin of the CGA, said: "The fact that the world Cup was expected to have more time in opposite the World Cup meant that in July last June, the market for pebs increased to 2.8 percent, but that the sale of restaurants was less than that.
In June, 1.8 percent of the retail trade worsened in July.
If the sales of restaurants are compared to the sales of restaurants, as long as the sales of restaurants have declined, the wine-growing companies and bars are still successful.
The food-walkers were also affected by the heat, but not as much as the restaurants were affected by the performances.
It looks like people just want to drink out.
Equally organized sales of fats and heavy drinks increased to 6.6 percent this month, while food sales decreased to three percent.
Commenting on the event and the guest event, Regional Sales Manager Paul Neuman said: "These results are continuing the process that we have seen since the end of April.
As far as external markets are concerned with sales, the impact of weather and major social events or games is the most important factor.
It is not surprising, despite the decline in sales of 4.8 percent of the year, that restaurant groups are currently facing difficulties, and this will be particularly painful due to the pressure on prices.
There was no longer any bad weather for food-borne operators, and time would indicate that a more reasonable degree of temperature would provide the necessary temporary rest.
With new exhibitors, the total sales of wells and restaurants was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decline in behaviour on the side of Brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker detects the sales of the manufacturing industry of the British Peach Tracker, Bars and Restaurant Sector, and investigates the collection of data from 47 operating groups, the total of which is 9 billion pounds, and this is the registered brand of the factory.
One of the five children has a secret social media account he hides from his parents.
A survey of five children aged 1 to 11 has classified social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey by the students of 20,000 secondary schools revealed an increase in the "Gali Insta" pages.
This news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of the students said that to show their parents, they have an "Marczy" account.
One out of every five children -- including 11-year-olds -- make social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
The survey conducted by the students of 20,000 secondary schools revealed a rapid increase in "Gali Insta" accounts, which is from a photo sharing site instincts.
This news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted.
20 percent of the students said that they have a clean "marczy" account to show their parents, while they also have private accounts.
A mother saw her 13-year-old girl secretly, and she found out a young girl who was trying to show others that she wanted to "get along with her."
Digital Awareness UK and Automatic Schools' Head Masters and Head Masters' Conference (HMC) research revealed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of which have admitted to maintaining their own private accounts.
HMC's chief Mike Bianan said, "It's disturbing that so many young people are busy making online accounts where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eli Doual Scotch Athletics Board will have "the sounds of the helicopters"
Eli Doyle has been selected as a member of the Pan-Eyxteum during the annual General Meeting of Management Affairs in Scottish Athletics.
The Doyle Scottland has the most beautiful track record, and Field Athletics and Charmaine Beatty consider this an excellent opportunity for game leaders who want to benefit from extensive international experience in the past decade.
Beatty said, "Eli Scotch, British and the world have a lot of respect for the Italian community and we are sure that they will have enough access to the Italians in Scotland."
And Doyle said, "I'm excited to hear the Italians, and I hope that I can help you in the direction of the games in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters of gold with his four other Olympic gold medals in the 1996 games in Italy, and is now a regular BBC player, has been successful after the temporary strike.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I was attacked by Strock.
I couldn't go.
Doctors said it'll only take time to tell me if I can be healthy or not, and to what extent.
It was a very patient trial, but I have been completely healed and have learned again how to walk, and I am practicing the course today!
Thank you for the encouraging message!
Brist Pamp's ad that compared mother to the nines has distributed online Aryan.
An ad from a Brest pump company distributed online Aryan, which compared breast milking to a cow.
The user technology company Elivi (Elvie) has been surprised to start the launch of the "Silent Brest Pump to be worn before the world" by a music video announcement to show the release that gives the new pump to the mother.
Four real mothers are dancing in a box full of nines and they say, "Yes, I'm breast-feeding, but you won't see it again," and "and if you don't think about it, it's not a three, it's my belly."
The song goes on, "Get it out, get it out, I'm feeding the kids, get it out, get it out, I'm milking the women."
However, the ad posted on Facebook page has generated online advertising.
With 77,000 votes and thousands of comments, the video has seen a response from the supervisor, which often says that it's lighting up the "bad effects" of the diary industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use the nuances for the sake of this design.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and they have to have a baby, except that their babies are taken from them a few days after they were born," one woman wrote.
Elie Brest sits right inside the pump Narsang Brazier (Elavi/man)
Another commented: "For poor children and for mothers there is pain."
But why not use them for a toast pump for the mothers who have their children with them?"
And another said, “The greatest Herald of Warning.”
Others defended the ad that a woman admitted to singing it "mazahah."
"I think it's a sexual harassment.
If I could still drink milk, I'd buy it.
Pamping makes me feel like a cow.
The ad is kind of crazy, but I've got it the same as it was intended for.
One wrote, "It's a mind design."
Another said, "It's a funny announcement whose goal is to be the moms who are pumping (mostly at work or in toilets) and it looks like they're giving themselves up."
It's not about commending or commenting on the industry of the ad.
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that she was dancing in her Brazils.
The back of the mummy is based on the idea that some women who pump toast look like their own cows.
However, Eli's pump is completely soundless, it has no stars, and it's carefully wrapped in the nose brazier that makes it possible to move women, keep their children, and pump them out.
In Mother, Partner and ECD Ana Bluren commented: "Elivi Pamp is a revolutionary design that needed fear and active launch.
We wanted to highlight Brest's pumping and all its challenges, while expressing it in a fun and relevant way, we wanted to highlight the wonderful sense of freedom that this new pump will bring.
It's not the first time that Eli's pumped into the heads.
The mother of two children in the London Fusion Vyka came to Katwak for the designer Marta Jakobowski.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a tin camp on the Texas border
The number of children displaced has increased, although the monthly cross-border requirement is relatively similar, and this is partly due to policies and explanations that have caused difficulties in keeping children with sponsors.
Traditionally, more patents are self-documented migrants, and they fear that they will be in danger of being able to claim a child to live in the country.
This increased the risk when the authorities announced that the potential sponsors and their family members would collect their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior promising Matthew Albins, who worked as an immigration and custom informant, testified in front of the Congolese that the agency had arrested individuals who had asked to sponsor young children alone.
Since then, the agency has confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record of the past.
"They have an illegal population of nearly 80 percent in the whole country, both of which are members of the pansers or members of the pansers' family, and a large number of them are non-national criminals.
So, we'll explore these people," said Albins.
According to the refugee workers, the authorities are implementing new laws that require some of them to be tried in court within a month rather than 60 days.
Many of them will be presented by video conference calls instead of by following the legal status proceedings before the Immigration Court.
Those who are unaware of their release will soon be transferred to D.C.
According to recent reports from the refugee workers and the system, children as long as they live in shelter are more likely to be disturbed or grieved, which may be the front of protests or attempts to disband.
The cossors said that these safeguards are more likely to ignore the signs of large magnitude, such as Turnillo, where children are more likely to suffer from difficulties.
He also said that moving a Tint Street without giving the children an appropriate time to prepare emotionally, or to make friends without saying good - bye, could be the cause of the damage that many children have suffered before.
In the evening, the American, the French and the left told the "arms of power" to leave immediately.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Vice-President Almelem said to return from Semish migrants, although the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
The teacher, who also serves as a missionary and a ministerial servant, said that non-national armed forces are unlawfully present on the land of darkness and "will be subjected to it"
He said to the assembly, "They should immediately fire without delay."
The student insisted that in the evening, "war on terrorism is almost over", which has left more than 360,000 people dead and millions are lost.
He said that terror groups and "any illegal illegal illegal presence" against the two of them, "Damish will fight this holy war until we clean all the dark areas out of them."
In the evening of the United States, there are nearly 2,000 soldiers, who basically provide training and consultation to the shadow Arabs and the armed forces against the President of Bashaladis.
There are more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the country since the French war.
In the case of foreign migrants, the teacher said that conditions are appropriate for their return, and he accused the "other Western countries" of spreading "extra-ethical fear" and that migrants are staying far away.
He said, "We have asked for help from organizations working for international community and human rights to facilitate the return of migrants."
"They're making the political thing that must be based on humanity."
The US and European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the construction of Chapter No in the evening until there is no agreement for the end of the war between the Bolsheviks and the Appropriations.
U.S. officials say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey has created an opportunity to put further pressure on political interests in order to settle in Abkhazia.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has stopped the attack of Russian-backed troops on the three-million-population border.
However, the teacher insisted that the treaty was a "interpretation period" and that it was hoped that the Austrian campaign would give way to the campaign, which included a series of anti-Alkala-related combatants, which would be "completed"
It is hoped that the U.S. envoys will soon hold a meeting of the new committee, which includes government and prosecuting parties, so that post-war elections and elections can be organized after the evening.
The teacher explained the conditions for Shame government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should "be limited to the review of dead bodies" and should be stopped.
Why the Tempus will win another time
In view of this logic, the elections will be re-elected in January 2020 if the accounts and scandals destroy their presidency in advance, as many liberal officials hope.

Foreign money is missing in the highest medium-term election for Evan's race.
It is not surprising that the 17th election of Pennsylvania is seeing the loss of money, thanks to the ninth grade of the Congolese branch, which has brought two new hopes for the same seat.

Lemb is fighting another Republican envoy, Kath Ruthphos, who is still representing the 12th anniversary of the former Pennsylvania, which is powerful enough as a new 17th anniversary.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redesigned maps, which said that the former provinces had been closed to use the Republicans illegally.
In the new 17th district, the party's financial assistants, the DCCC and the National Republican Championship Committee (NRCC) waged a war between the party's financial partners.

At the beginning of this month, Mudha's translator Hethhar Naurt said that State Department officials "as a result of the recent decisions not to recognize TV" decided to invite American cafs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But punishments were only kept in custody against El Salvador, which had received US aid for drug control, growth and economic assistance in 2017.
Major punishments, including restrictions on poverty and disability, could be painful for the Central American country and its increased unemployment and murder.
As was the case at the internal meetings, the North American and Central American authorities agreed to a high-level conference, with the focus on security and economic prosperity, and it was for the presentation of the last year's meeting, and it was seen as a major step towards preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, the senior executives made it clear that they wanted to make progress at a conference that would effectively eliminate any protection of punishment for El Salvador.
Investigators say the meeting is being criticized for speaking on the Vice-President Mike Pens as a symbol of change in administrative agreements in mid-October.
And three U.S. envoys went back from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or punishment.
A White House member of JAN BLATTON refused to comment on the debate about which three U.S. officials, including two investigators, were prepared to discuss the internal debate on the condition that the name should be kept secret.

Women's Retirement Retirement Is Not Self - Retirement
Although the participants of the survey were aware of how they should be viewed, few people were talking to family members about it.
Nearly half of the people in the U.S. research said that they think they're dealing with their partners for a long time.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
The vice president of the state's Life Insurance Business Holly Sander said, "People want to keep a family that cares for them, but they don't take a step to think about it."
We have to start from here.
Talk to your children and partners in life: If you don't inform your family about your wishes before the time comes, you can't prepare to provide your family with care.
Let's think about the exchange to work with your consultant and your family, and think about how to use it, because these options can be prominent elements in the statement of achievement.

Get your legal documents out: stop legal battles.

In addition, take into account the authority to make decisions about your financial affairs.

earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The government has said that Agha has killed at least 384 people in powerful earthquakes in Palo, Indonesia, and Somalia, hoping to increase the rate of death.
The assistance officers from the area of Dong Gala are not allowed to receive any information, which is a region in the north of Palo and is near the centre of an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were killed after the storm.
The following are some basic information from Palo and Dong Gala on the island of Solavisi:
Palo Central is the capital of the Soviet Union, located on the west side of the island of Solavisi, at the edge of a narrow church, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
When earthquake and tsunami came, the 40th anniversary of the city was enjoying its joy.
The Doming Gala Island is located 300 kilometers (180 miles) north of the island of Solavisi. It is located in the area of over 300 km (180 km) north of the island.
The Regency Bay is an administrative area with a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The livelihood of the Central Solomon Islands is largely dependent on the land and agriculture, especially the coastal region of the Dong Gala.
The hearing also plays an important role in the exit zone, but it is mostly the opposite of the beach area of Moru Ali.
Pallo and Dong Gala have been affected by tsunamis in Indonesia's flood since the last 100 years.
In 1938, Sonami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dong's Bay.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the West Dong Valley, killing nine people.
The Indonesian earthquake occurs in the peaceful color of the fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years are as follows:
2004: Sunami, who arrived in the North Sampatra province of Indonesia on 26 December, provoked another Sunami, which affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along with the beachbed of the Indian Ocean, including half more in Asia.
2005: In early March and early April, powerful quakes hit the west coast of the Camera.
Hundreds of people were killed on the coast of the island of Nas.

More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: There was an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude from the island of Mantawa near the Samtara, with a tsunami of up to 20 feet (10 m) high, killing about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake occurred in Asia in the region, which destroyed and spread fear and terror because people were reminded of the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed for crying buildings.
2018: There were major earthquakes in the Indian island of Lubuk, killing more than 500 people, most of which were killed north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and put thousands of buildings in temporary danger.
Sarah’s eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
The former Governor and Vice-President of Alaska has been arrested in charge of attacking Sara Pilen's biggest son, Trek Pilen.
According to a weekly report by Elska State Troopers, 29-year-old Salska-related pilots were arrested on the grounds of domestic violence, in violation of the domestic violence report, and in response to arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman in charge tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she picked up her phone from him.
KTUU has reported that Palan has been remanded at Mat-Su Pretril Facility and is placed on the $500 unsecured gang

His mother, Sarah Pillen, called the police to report the apparent attack.
This case is now in front of Elsca's Wind Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assaults, assaults on family violence reports, and armed with Zacchaeus.
His throat friend accused him of killing him on the face.
In 2016, the former military groups targeted Sara Pilen as they paired their son's violent behavior with PTSD, which increased in Iraq after his services.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of deaths
On Friday, at least 384 people died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Solovissi.
7.5 A massive earthquake caused the tsunami to destroy thousands of homes.
The system of energy and entertainment has been disrupted and is expected to increase the mortality rate in the next few days.
The earthquake came near the middle of the Indonesian capital, the north-east of the movement.
Videos on the earthquake are on social media.
Hundreds of people were gathered for the Memorial of Christ’s death when they marched out of the Solomon Islands.
Propaganda protestors in New York City are calling for a death sentence against the threat of terrorist attacks in the city.
In New York, police prosecutors in New York called for a death penalty against Sepulvo Sappou, who had killed eight people by death -- the death penalty is a severe punishment that has never been heard of in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old shop was apparently using a truck to attack the road of the bicycles in the Lower Mainton, using a home duo truck and to hit the pedestrians and bicycles on their way.
As a result of the death penalty in the south of New York City, according to the Notts, prosecutors will have to prove that Sepio has targeted eight people and "integratedly" serious physical injuries.
According to the court documents, the punishment for both of these crimes is death.
Weeks after the attack, a defiant Grand Jury accused a person of 22 charges against Zapov, including 8 charges against the regime, usually used by the defiant prosecutors in criminal proceedings, and a charge of violence and car destruction.
Prescotts appointed the attack by Sepivo as "a man of violence and thought" and said that the attack needed "a sufficient planman and thinker."
The following notes say, "Sifolo, my dear God, has hurt, hurt, hurt, and hurt the family and friends of Djigos, Nicolas Cleves, Darren Djikat, Erlegi, Harn Ferochi, Harn Dego Mendoza and Eligenro Damien Pgnocho."
Five of the victims were from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the death of New York City.
In September 2009, he was sentenced to two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was sentenced to the last of his life in prison.
Last time in New York, the death penalty was imposed in 1953 on Julius and Ithile Dag, a married couple who had been sentenced to two years before the Cold War in Soviet Union, and later were sentenced to death.
On June 19, 1953, the two daily elections were killed by the British Cross.
According to the court documents, the Pakistani city security officer did not express any regret in the coming days and months of the attack.
The police said he told the investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the charges, Sepov told the government that he had been affected to watch ISIS videos on his phone for the attack.
The police also told him that he had requested the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
22 charges he's accused himself of being innocent.
One of the public prosecutors who represented the company said, "They're really disappointed" with the appeal's decision.
He said, "We think that the sentence of life in prison, where there's no way to live, will cause more mental harm to anyone involved in this case."
Sappou's defence team first called for no death penalty.

Russia's Grand Perx: In Team Orders, Leo Schmalton came closer to the world's honour after winning against the Sabestine Hotel.
It became clear at the same time that Walter Botez had taken a major role in the Mercedes Team Orders Reis before Leo Schulton.
From Pol, Butaz started a good start and almost gave Milton a lead in defending his status during the first two weeks and invited Vitell to attack his teammate.
The hotel first went to the pits and pushed Milton on the back of the package to the traffic which he had to decide.
Mercedes later completed the leep and followed the hotel, but at the same time moving forward, the pilot of the escape was in danger of a two-way internal detachment in defense of the third corner.

These were very bad physical signs.
President Donald Trump pointed out to him on a Sunday on a relay at Senator Deeline Stein's insistence that he did not publish a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, who accused the Supreme Court of sexual assault on Bret Kwana.
Speaking to a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given to the Senate of Ford's Jewish Committee, but rather commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "senses, liars and liars."
They said, "What could be, and the beautiful thing that happened in the past few days, is that when you see anger, when you see people filled with anger, lying, and full of wrath."
"When you see things going on and things going on and then you say, "Yes, I didn't.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dean Pine Stein, did you report it?
Remember the answer... did you print the papers-- "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't confess."
All right, hold on a minute.
He said more about a senator's opinion, "Did we expose... did we not expose?"
Finn Stein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kiwana from Ford in July, and it was issued in early September -- but Finn Stein denied that it was issued by his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish his story," the Hill report told the committee.
They told me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret, as they said.
But their refusal was not correct according to the president who commented on it during the week's Riley: "I tell you that it was a very bad idea.
They may not have invented it, but it was the worst thing I could ever see."
Defending his representatives for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that Democrats were using charges for their own benefit

Micronesia's plane crashed: Air Neuguni says that a person is trapped after the plane crashed.
Airline operating in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a person is trapped, while the first said by Airline that all 47 passengers and operations were taken out of the submarine.
Air Newgney said on a ferry that until Saturday night, she's failing to find out a man who's traveling.
Airline said she's working with local authorities, hospitals, and research workers to find this person.
Airline has not yet responded to requests for further details about the travel immediately, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped to save the lives of other passengers and workers after trying to land the ship's Czech Airport.
The government said on Thursday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
Airline said on the day of the week that six passengers remained in the hospital, and they were all standing.
The cause of the crisis and the correct timing of the events is unclear.
Airline and U.S.News, both of them said that the ship was landing a bit away from Ren Wae.
Some of those witnesses thought that the ship was off the line.
The U.S. passenger Bal Gins said the plane was very low.
He said, "This is a very good thing."

He prepared the soil for Jair how he used cell phone records 29-year-old Coint Talis, and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers to gather his death, movements and shells.
Clarion Ledger reported that Roulette said that he had taken the location data from a number of cell phones, showing that Teles was with his death in the evening of his death, which is part of his previous claims.
When the data showed that he had his phone at the time, he said that he was with his friend Michael San Ford, and the police went to talk to San Ford.
San Ford testified on the day of the week that he was not in the city today.
When the petitioner asked whether Teles was telling the truth that he was in the San Ford truck tonight, San Ford said, "He's talking a little because my truck was in the middle of nowhere."
Another inconsistency was that Teles said that when Shambars died, he knew him for two weeks.
Cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Teles removed the Cambers messages, colleges, and contact information from his phone.
He said, "He took it out of his life."

Another black panda?
Nini, a New York-related couple, filed a complaint after they were released from work on the "Silian" message.
A message from a young mother who is from New York, who was misdirected that she was "a black and a black fan", after which the couple's case is being prosecuted for being discriminated against.
The couple denied that they were ethnicists, and the possibility was that the purpose of the case was to "adopt"
Lucy Plasco Felix Man, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment at the arrival of the first day of Gisil Maris, the new child care provider in 2016.
Ms. Plasco Felix Man sent a message to his husband, "No, another black man."
Instead of sending her husband, however, they sent Ms. Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, "Prisan" was a plastician, Felix Man, when he found out that she was not doing her job properly and that they were expecting any Filipinos.
Ms. Marais was paid one day and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Maris is making a bid to be taken out on the couple, and for six months, he's asking for $350 a day for the job that they were paid for without a contract.
He told New York Post on Thursday, "I want to show them that you can't do that," and he added, "I know this is ethnicism."
The couple turned down the charge of the Spanish family saying that getting Maris out of work was a reasonable job because they couldn't rely on him to make him angry.
"My wife sent him something he didn't mean to say.
He's not a hero.
We're not ethnic," said Juli Plasko to New York Post.
But will you hand your children over to someone with whom you're staying, even if it's wrong?
To your newborn child?
Try to understand."
P.P. said his wife would become the mother of the child two months later, and he said, "There's a lot of trouble in the situation."
"Are you going to follow such a person?
It's no thank you," said Car Banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the media court is pushing the couple to hold their hands on social media, and their attitude and reasoning are targets for prosecution.
A new letter revealed that the publishers of Paddington are afraid that the four-year-olds will not meet themselves.
Bund's daughter, Karen Jencol, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to feel somewhere else for the first reader to publish her.
Now it's very nice to know that Paddington was behind the great success.
Talking about his father, who had worked as a BBC camera manager before writing a book about a small drop of rain, said they were pretty hopeful to stop their book, and he added that the 60th anniversary of the release of the books after their death was "a sufficient amount of thirst but cold."
Padington, who told her family about the most important thing she's ever said, said that her father was very proud of her final success.
They said, “He was an unchaste person, and he was not arrogant.”
"But because they had Paddington very real, it's just like you're a kid and he's gonna make it: you're proud of them, even if it's not your business.
I think they saw the success of Padington in this way.
Although it was their creation and design, they were always crediting Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to the phone.
After Linding, his daughter was immediately taken to leis parlor 2 hospitals, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Ned was regularly calling to tell us that his condition is very bad and is not expected to be safe."
"Then I assumed that she would die in the next one or two minutes, and I'd like to thank her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashie, Darling I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications he was given to keep his heart pumped by doctors were losing their influence and out of his system.
She died a while ago, and it was all over now.
I just had to wait there, knowing it's all coming out.
I couldn't cry and I couldn't run, I was home to people and families.
I really had to stand by myself."
Last but not least, Ms. Adnan Lepres, who was born on the death of her daughter, boarded the ship with other passengers, who were not immune to their suffering.
He said, "No one knew anything."
"My head was down, and the tears kept dripping with my eyes."
It's hard to explain, but it happened during the flight when I felt very emotional for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding
I knew how much he loved it."

Miss Deos' son was 13 years old when he was depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
He said, "I don't want to see any parents like I do."
45-year-old Miss Deos, who lives in London, said that his son was a windshield head of which mosque was affected.

On Christmas, it was very sad. When the children opened their presents, they did not see them, nor did they do anything else."
He said, “He has suffered a great loss for them, but they have to pass by him. He creates a new creation in his family.”
It breaks us.
But all of us are going to do it and fight it."

After F.B.I.'s investigation, the future of Bret Kwana is in the middle of nowhere.
Janab Fly said on the Sunday, "I thought we could do something like that, as he says -- a research that has a schedule and a time limit -- maybe we can make some connections about it," and he added, adding, he said, "They fear the "division" committee, as a result of the leadership group.
Why don't you want to explore Javak Kiwana and their Republican Hamit F.B.D.?
It's just a matter of time.
The average elections to be held on November 6 are only five weeks away -- if Republicans lose badly, as expected, they will become very weak in trying to make their own election in the country's highest court.
George Doblio is calling the senators, and they're trying to build a strong bond for support to Kevin, who works for the White House, and they got his wife, Ashley, who was a secret secretary.
What happens after the F.B.I. report arrives?
The Senate will use the right to vote, which contains 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not yet clear whether Janab will succeed in obtaining 50 votes on the Javanese Senate floor, which will enable Vice-President Mike Pens to break down and confirm their appointment in the Supreme Court.
North Korea is undermining its resistance
A South Korean law firm has said that seven years ago, less Yong has reduced the number of migrants to South Korea since his entry into power.
Park Beong Sög referred to the data from South Korea's trade union, saying that last year there were 1,127 irregulars -- 2,706 in 2011.
Janab Park said that between North Korea and China were more important factors than border controls and Samgulers.
Pong didn't make any public comments.
A large number of migrants coming from North Korea have been presented with South Korea's citizenship
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have now crossed the border illegally since the end of the war in 1953
Most of the Chinese flee with the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross the most secure unscrupulous zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China portrays immigrants as illegal Turks and returns them with a lot of power.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, two countries' leaders were found in Pong Yang, whose goal was to reduce nuclear weapons to domestic violence.
This meeting took place in June after the historic meeting of US President Tromp and Mk Jong, when he agreed to the extensive conditions to clean the island of Esos Korea from nuclear power plants.
But on Sundays, North Korea's officials, Ri Yongho, have been blaming for the decline in progress in the United States.
In a speech from the United Nations General Assembly in New York, John Rie said, "Without any confidence in the darkness, there will be no confidence in our national peace, and in such a situation, there is no way we can first unarm ourselves in one side."
Nancy Palisi told Brett Kwana that he was hunted and added that he was unwilling to perform services in the Supreme Court.
Ewan's political envoy, Nancy Palisi, told the distinguished Brit Kwana for the Supreme Court and said that he was temporarily unwilling to perform services in the Supreme Court.
Palisi made this comment during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Sunday.
Palisi responded to the testimony of the Senate Jewish committee on Thursday, saying, "I can't do anything, but I think if a woman does that, they'll call her "Heaven."
Kiwana emotionally denied the charges that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Balsa Ford, when they were both young.
At the beginning of their story, Kiwana was very emotional, and sometimes talked about her family and high school years and was afraid.
He criticized the committee's Democrats for saying openly that the charges made by the Liberals were "songful attacks and protests", which angered Henry Clinton's 2016 presidential election.
Palosi said that they believe that the testimony of Kiwana has proved that they cannot perform services in the Supreme Court because it has proved that they are against the Democrats.
And he said, "I think they've been self-inflicted by their statements and criticism of Clants and Democrats."
When Paulis was asked, "If you're confirmed about Kiwana, and the Democrats get most of the eve representatives, will they try to accuse him, and will they take the lead on him?"
He said, "I'll say, if they're not true with the Congolese or the FBI, they're not only members of the Supreme Court, but not members of the court where they are now."
Kivana is currently a judge in D.C. Circuit Court near Apples.
Pólis further stated that, as a Democrat, they are concerned about the possible decision against the Affordable Care Act (Roe v. Wade) because it is considered a permanent judge.
In her confirmation hearing, Kiwana abstained from asking whether she would be willing to make compensation for some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
He said, "It's not time for the soul to be judged, and to expect us to say, "Is that not surprising?"
And the women must guard it.
It's an unmistakably bitter claim that anger lasts months and years, and she can't get away with it without crying.
Dear Stephen told me 45 years later, "We cry when we're angry."
"I don't think it's normal, do you think?"
He continued, "A woman helped me a lot who was on an exotic promise, and he said that even when I'm angry, they're crying, but they got a capacity that meant that when they get angry, they start crying, saying to someone they talk to, "You might think I'm disappointed."
But I'm angry."
Then she spoke.
And I thought it was great.
The tears are allowed to extract at least the anger because they are essentially mistaken.
There's a great memory of a man's initial job in a man's defeat office, where I found myself crying with an invincible expression when a big woman grabbed me from my neck -- a cold-blooded manager I was always afraid of -- and he pushed me to the forest of sex.
He told me, "Don't ever let others see that you're crying."
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are disappointed and they are glad that they have won the victory over you.
Patricia Shorder, who was then a Democratic Congolese woman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his election.
In 1987, when Janab Hart was infected with a boat that went into the Manchi Bans Valley and left the race, Ms. Schroeder became very disappointed and there was no reason for them not to think of fighting the presidential election themselves.
30 years later, he told me with a hint, "It wasn't an obvious decision."
"There were already seven other hopes in the race, and the last thing they needed was another hope.
Someone called it "Sino White and Seven Plants."
Because it was a long time ago, and she was late enough to collect the money, and so they promised they wouldn't be in the race until they got $2 million together.
It was a troubled war.
They found out that some of their supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give them $250.
And they will be surprised; “Do they think that I have any benefit from them?”
When they announced that they did not start a ritual, they expressed gratitude to their supporters, the system that created so much difficulty in collecting funds, and instead of using votes, and was so overwhelmed by feelings of sexuality that they became depressed.
My Lord Schroeder remembered the press's reaction, and he said, "You'll think I'm going to be a nurse down there."
"You'll think that Clinix was my corporate pioneer.
I remember what they would write on my letter?
"They're crying?"
How the US and China's commercial war will benefit China
According to experts, there was a lot of noise from commercial war between America and China, and as the war has not ended, it could be useful for China between the two countries.
US President Donald Trump launched the first tax spot on Chinese exports of solar panels, steel and aluminium over the last 24 years.
More clearly, this week, when $200 billion (£150 billion) was introduced to affect the property's assets, a new area was taxed on nearly half of the US coming from China.
Bangang has reacted every time that the most recent $60 billion has been taxed at five to ten percent of the U.S.A.
China has given off the US slot and the world's second largest economy is not visible as it is now weak.
To force the U.S. to return is to accept its demands, but in general to surrender to the U.S. president of China who will be very ashamed of the pang.
However, experts still say that China can do its job properly, that the pressure of the US trade war can last long, and that the two countries may have a positive impact on China.
Focusing on Asia for the New American Society's focus on a three-way technology related to RSI, Abigail Grace says, "It's true that one of the two Americans or China's immediate political decisions can create situations that can create economic difficulties for either country and that is more dangerous than the first citizens did not admit."
The presidents say there's a three for the return of the migrants in the evening.
She says she's willing to volunteer for the return of the migrants, and she's been applying for the construction of the country's capital for more than seven years from the long war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Special Rapporteur Almelem said that conditions in the country are better off.
They said, "The situation on earth today is more stable and more secure than the one fighting for the cause of fear."
The government is rehabilitating areas that have been destroyed by terrors to bring about normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for voluntary return in the country of migrants that they have to leave because of fear and one-sided economic measures that have damaged their homes and fronts.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million people left the country after the war began in 2011.
More than six million people in the country need human support
Almelim said the regime would welcome assistance in the construction of the country's new capital.
But they insisted that it would not accept the aid or aid from the countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
