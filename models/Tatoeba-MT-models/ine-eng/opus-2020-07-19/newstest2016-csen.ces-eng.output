At the emergency call, the professor admitted to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it's necessary for them to come home.
Lamb presided that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that contact with the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," was in a letter signed by Lamb by the authorities.
There was no doubt that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to school campus, where the police believe he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
Police chief at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 this morning.
Lamb made a fateful phone call on the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school, the students and the faculty were forced to hide behind the closed doors, the authorities entrusted are still trying to record what Lamb's motivation was.
Details published by investigators on the part of the state and students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented, but probably a problem teacher.
The students confirmed that they were pleased with his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record in the criminal record or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, to thank "blessed people", with which he shared his academic life.
Both were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History with the next 17th members of the Faculty, and many students went to courses at both at once.
At the same time, there have been inclinations with regard to problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed excited and upset, "if there was nothing wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, pointed out that Lamb told him that he was suffering from stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb already asked Delta State University for free for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university employees meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not have provided him with an automatic functional period to become an assistant professor.
The president of the University of William LaForge stated that he knew no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb probably suffered something."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After he left the campus, the police caught his mark when he crossed the border of Arkansas state back to Mississippi.
Before he could have been arrested, Lamb killed himself with the only gun in the courthouse about a mile from his parents in Greenville suburb of Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of the state of Washington,methel Johnson.
The car left it on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb began to work at a university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which is about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught the geography and the hours of education.
In the spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's long friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston stated that she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through common friends.
She was with her friends at high school, and he was the great older boy who taught her to play guitar for a few years.
It was quite a heart launderer back then.
The hearts of all the girls disappeared as soon as he showed up," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss probably spent some time together.
During the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the record of the wedding never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house next to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were separated 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely disappointed," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
He said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail went out to the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
He said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and an occasional fun coordinator in The Julep Room, a slow-lighted bar near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the path Lamb reached the guitar and harmony for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We were flattering and filming each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in the first year and specializes in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a male student club and the government of students.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, attended the commemorative events with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnitt also attended the Watchtower, during which the university assembly sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there is no evidence that they were truly committed.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us states that they won't pick as many seasonal workers as last year, but the producer of toys and products claims to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 40,000 employees at business and distribution centres all over the country, which declined against 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company announces that it will start with the recruitment of the entrants this month, and the employee will pick up during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is getting closer and companies are preparing to receive temporary assistance in shops and sales, for dispatching and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'range' with Princess Diana
The premiere "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal family, when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," said in a trailer for the next document, "Back in time."
The movie is starting and I'm coming up with something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in time," is a document on "Return to the Future," which provides talks with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The "Back to the Future" premiere was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really for me the best travel document ever filmed."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
The chief of the United Nations says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons only exacerbates the violence and suffering of millions.
The chief of the United Nations called again on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support an inclusive political solution.
Ban said at the mid-term press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the end of the ministerial meeting of the Valna Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He said policing that the division in the Council and between Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unresolved."
The Ban called on the five remaining members to show solidarity and unity, which they demonstrated when reaching the Iranian nuclear agreement in solving the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers that show Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others over the tiny hand as over the unpredicted joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But if some Republicans are already trying to get Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they won't do it (now).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people are really starting to ask what this means for the nomination of this magnet from the real estate area.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is probably winning a Republican nomination.
The experts point out that during this period of 2011 Rick Perry was on the way to Herman Cain's resignation, and not one of them won the only position in the nomination process.
There are a lot of reasons why he could be in general elections.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bushe and the Club for Growth's economic conservative group are aware of Trump's willingness to hold and start spending their dollars on the table with a view to hitting him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that the real magnet is not just a mixed phase:
The trumpet rating of the favour was 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University voted that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real magnet.
In mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three out of ten say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are kept in the initial stages.
Following the vote of the University of Quinnipiac, which took place last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP's wishes would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey, which took place last week, 67 per cent of Republicans reported that they would be either "satisfaction" or "satisfaction" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 admitted that they would be "burned" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of excitement as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "invented" against 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
Another closest to the level of excitement?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican volunteers claim that they would be "unsatisfied" or "unsatisfied" if they were to favour Jeb Bush as a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his insensibility and insult, 52 per cent of the Republican voters are stately inclined to think that the real magnet has the right temperature for the post president, according to Monday's vote ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is kept in Iowa State Senate Club, which is the first in the whole country, where 52 per cent of Republicans think they have the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he has no personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say that his temper does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to this idea.
When he puts on his student hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who most likely wins the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 spent their money on Jeb Bush.
Full publication: The GOP voters did not have the most clear crystal ball in the past.
During the past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the winner of the 28% candidacy for the possible nomination of Mitt Romney.
However, it is shown that a number of GOP fans see the Trump campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some students stress that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is spread widely among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the study of Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in the hypothetical direct battle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always receiving majority support.
He leads over Carly Fiorin by 13 points, Mark Rubim by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jebe Bushem by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christ by 33 points at each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead over a merchant with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical fight against one another.
The vast majority of the stairs of Donald Trump claim they have already made their own opinion.
The new Tuesday CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of Trump's supporters claim that they will no longer change their opinion.
It is obvious that many things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46% say they're leaving the back door open to change between the candidates.
However, Trump's current strongest opponent is his external neurosurgeon Ben Carson's colleague, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his campaign announcement, immigration is still being held as the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some are afraid that Trump's bluffing distances key Spanish voters from the Republican side and the damage of rebranding efforts.
But according to a new Sunday survey of ABC/Post public opinion, six of the 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that while the topic of immigration remains in the shadow of the reflectors, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government reaches new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive nearly half of the support from the Republican volunteers, and above all because of their status as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in a new Monday's ABC/Post vote claim they prefer political outsiders than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The vote of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated with Republicans in Congress, 54 per cent were "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent were "sufferingly angry."
Szymovna supported a higher share of the state's carbon charges.
Czech Republic gets over 400 million.
In the first reading, the Ambassador supported a government novelty of the upper law, which adjusts the amount of the charges on the surface of coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (CSSD) promised the MPs that this would add money to the budgets of the municipalities.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition Members who fear that businesses will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities just as much as they do today, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in its first reading supported the government's new top law, which means, in addition to others, that the State should receive a greater share of the revenues from the surface tax of coal from mining companies.
The country's share increases by 67 per cent, while the population's share decreases from today's 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for the non-growth that companies incur.
The change in interest rates for the interest rate is expected to bring in a government deposit of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
According to the government, the budget revenue of the municipalities is to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the year preceding, the municipalities received around 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
In the coal industry, there were about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns in the state.
Novela is also calculated with an increase in the yield area of 1000 kroner per hectare per year.
The receipt of these grants shall continue to be to the full extent of the municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (CSSD) told the MPs that this meant that the country received 14 million to 100 million crowns each year.
The amount of the fee will no longer be fixed by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The refund shall be recalculated as a component of the amount of depleted non-growth and the rate for each type of non-growth.
According to the government, the change is due, inter alia, to a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the envoy of the ODS Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a fee by a government regulation should not be in accordance with the constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládka, this is not the case because the state is paying the interest that is a state's property.
Fees shall be granted only to the municipalities whose territory is affected by the demand.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the city and a quarter of the state will receive money.
The same ratio will be true in the case of radioactive ovens.
Part of the money that you can make on the fee of your choice will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage to demand or to ensure a banishment service.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that they would harm the affected communities and the countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Oldosts) warned that businesses would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities just as much as they do today because they would pay higher fees directly to the government budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in the Ústek region.
Before the rise of unemployment in the Mostecka, the KSČM M.H.A.A. warned the M.A. Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulička failed to propose to refuse the novel, but Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to work.
The explanatory report states that, according to the companies concerned, the increase in fees does not lead to coal prices, as prices are more than 90 per cent of the duration of the contract.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heaters, should therefore not feel any price growth.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that trade unions will compensate for the increase in wages to reduce their operating costs, which in particular would mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
According to it, however, the increase in wages from the point of view of employment is negligible.
According to the report on the news of Milan Urbana (CSSD), it is key for the Members to know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal.
If the coal is stretched beyond the limits, it will have an impact on the income for the state and the country, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Youth that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovakian army should fall until 2020.
The limits below ČSA should be broken for social, national and long-term domestic energy stability.
Happy to take the Czechs as a single, setting up an influential weather.
All four common services will appear during the quartering of Davis’s cup shop in India on the table and this time each of them will probably also get into the game.
Captain Jaroslav Vrátil plans to spread the burden on the entire quartet, given the difficult conditions.
In Dillí there is hot and high air humidity, so there are demanding battles that can stretch up to five hundred.
We've got to get it in the bag.
I'd like to expand it by weather.
And according to what it would look like, he said back at today's Czech election training in the center of Radje Kumár Khanny.
With one team and the world's forty Jiřím Happy, it counts for Friday and Sunday doubles.
In the position of the twin, Lucas Rosal and Radek Štěpánek are likely to flow.
I'd like to get involved with almost everyone.
I've got it in my head, but I won't tell you yet, Captain.
Another security in the Czech assembly should be Štěpánko's participation in the Saturday 4th.
It's just a question of who's going to stand next to an experienced fool who has a cup in Davis's fourth balance sheet 18:4.
It's probably not going to be happy.
There are still possibilities with Rosal or Adam Pavlás.
"I really don't know who and what it's gonna look like," said Return.
It shall be decided by two developments.
The version may be Pavlásek, surprised with Joy in the 1st round by winning in the fat on Australians.
"He's a decent guy," said Return.
I'm happy to do it against Australia, and if I'm playing, I'd like to do the same thing I've been doing since the second set.
"I'd like to get a point for those experiences," said Paullasek.
The home is placed in Yuki Bhambri's double (125th in the ATP Scoreboard), which won the challenger last week in Shanghai, where he beat third and fourth hundred scorers.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164.).
They're both challengers and our ATP Tour experience, but we've been convinced many times that the fingernails in Davis' cup don't decide.
"It's a momentary form, weather," said Return.
The five initial twos start at 6:30 SELČ and can be drawn due to weather.
According to the forecast, she's got a brush and the jacket is not under the roof.
However, it can be played by artificial lighting, if any.
They've already burned it and it's got some two thousand luxury, which is enough.
"It should be done under the lights," said Returnil.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ is very eagerly expected since his election
The new workman Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and he will first have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after the afternoon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and the MPs.
In a weekly statement, he asked for "less theaters and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr Corby, who comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to remain silent during the national hymn singing in the service on Tuesday to the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the British battles met with criticism from a number of conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the title pages.
Mr. Corby's decision not to sing national hymns drew attention
Speaking Mr. Corbyn said he'd "stand still in honour silence" and recognizes "the hero of the royal flight in the battle of Britain."
However, a member of the shadow cabinet Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, announced to the BBC Two's Newsnight program that he would recommend to the Labourist leader that the national hymn sing "without regard" to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve at the top of Mr. Corbyn's team, quoted differences in economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the political differences in work are also "organised" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn through his position in the European Union and the government's limit of doses.
Mr Corbil pointed out at the TUC conference that the Working Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, a shadow worker and employee, stated that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Daily Party, whom David Cameron has been facing for decades since his election as leader of conservatives.
The leader of the working party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas "from the bottom" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will be held back both "prepared responses," as well as toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow business secret, will represent him at PMQ if he is not involved — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also left the idea that he would allow other colleagues to come out from time to time because he heard that he was still discussing the whole matter with the speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to turn himself away from the "Punch and Judy" policy, which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later he admitted to failing.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer in the decision of the leaders, their management of the library and their position among the other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become cartoons and that they need long-term reforms.
"Focenion in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The Johannesburg Centre is a difficult place for homeless people.
But one group of former children found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was drawn in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighbors and make money like that.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra climbs, while the growth of wages in the United Kingdom accelerates
Libra skipped the following data and showed the recovery of British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was led up to the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June the GB profit including bonuses rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
It was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed as if the estimates were approaching when the rates were rising.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar at $1.5505 and was 0.84% above the euro at €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped by 20% after he got an approach to the offer from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two of the world's biggest breweries, and bring closer brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry stock was 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the Richemont luxury group.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
Stocks in Glencore stood 5% after the desired giant said they stood at $25bn using shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
Stocks in the package and paper group Mondi were the biggest decline in the index and dropped by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating on the company to "sale."
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports company reported 83% jumps in half of the year in profits before taxing £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage the expansion
Executive President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that higher minimum wages for UK employees could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would exceed the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
The costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, adding, which could mean less new jobs.
Protesters of Prague's apartment marchmeloon ride.
The controversial building got a stop.
The investor of Prague Projecti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be illegal and will appeal against it.
Against the building, which is to be created in close proximity to the Anješka monastery in the centre of Prague, protested before the Prague office of 1 hundred people, including the petition.
The judge found in the decision that there had been a breach of the building law because not all of the provisions of the territorial decision were respected.
"The subject matter of the territorial decision does not include certain aspects, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clear and understandable form of the building, the definition of the area affected by the impact of the building," the decision states.
It also considers that some of the grounds for the decision were issued to the documents originally discussed but changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to occur on the ground National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the written material that, however, the landowner has only given consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not the agreement with the location of the building on his land, the building committee writes.
According to Francesca Augusta Rasetta of the investment firm, the building order committee did not take into account the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the period for the initiation of the review had already expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we have observed all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto stated in the press report.
A project that people, for the sake of the supposedly proposed color of the facades, call for a strong emotion in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people gathered in the past to protest against the building.
The association and the people of neighboring homes suggest that a permit was issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the inconsistencies of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Anješka monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Franek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which was calculated with a refined facade, rejected the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Monumental Institute (NPU) and abolished the permission of the Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Prague Projecti e Investimenti with face-to-face windows was approved by NPU and the master memoirs were granted building permits on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the extracts of the opponents, since he never counted with the facade in pink that gave the project a nickname after pink sugar.
The Czech policy has bound migrants.
The Hungarians put him in the bass with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On his way, he took three Syrian refugees with his crew to the car, who were about six miles [half km] away.
At that time, according to him, it was not yet punishable in Hungary, he claimed to be a People's Journalist.
We knew that law enforcement didn't act like that.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise we were arrested and transferred to the investigation chain in Szeged, he wrote a letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in politics.
The police were doing the right thing, but the communication was tied up, because they didn't have too good English.
But he thought the prison was sad.
For example, in our target of a size of about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were forced to flee.
There was also a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people had already been locked up the other day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them, Berg told them.
What can't have fun anymore?
Ask the Presidents of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9., from 9:30, he will answer the readers' questions to the President of the Chamber of Executives of the Czech Republic, Pavl Fuchíková.
You can ask her for changes to the law on executions applicable from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to executions or executions.
Metcash starts a campaign on the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA business from Aldi's campaign in southern and western Australia.
Metcash starts a campaign on the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added with brands such as the Simmo's ice cream maker based on Dunsborough offering IGA tastings and the owners of the stores are selling cheap tickets to local customers on the Australian football league.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the seller of food, alcohol and hardware celebrates its annual investment strategy day.
There is a lot in bet, because South and West Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA's business moves and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and West Australia are notorically provincial and IGA trades are using a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern States.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will attract 5% of the food market in these two countries within 12th months of the opening of the first shops that took over the markets from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose USD 360 million on annual sales and USD 250 million on Metcash at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in southern Australia and 30 in western Australia during the next year and generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a solid Metcash price base could be about $13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly towards Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that the buyers in the IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will drop by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and its market share decreases from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the head of the Hamish Douglass Fund, founder of the Magellan Group, said that trade lunches in Melbourne could "very likely disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comment.
But it is known that a member of Metcash's delegation contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA decreased from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and Metcash's food market profits, which are supplied by around 1200 retail IGA , have dropped by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of speculative changes because sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesale has gone into the counter-attack and invests more than USD 150 million a year to compare pulse prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and thus helps small IGA retailers to reequip their stores by adding fast growing food and news from private customers.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, argues that the price comparison and acquisition programmes capture the fall and hopes that the great-grandfather will return to basic profit growth in 2017 first in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his respect rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a further loss in recent events around his friend Nick Kyrgyz and deserves his praise rather than criticism, says President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks", drew unwelcome attention to himself due to the affair with an unrecognised Kyrgyus and Stan Wawrinko on Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in the passionate qualifying match at Cincinnati, they had to be Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison separated twice by the judge, Harrison then declared: "The warline had one to pull Kyrgyz and I had to pull him too."
While he was last seen crashing the rocket after the hunter had captured Richard Gasquet's potential power at the US Open, Kokkinakis was invinciblely defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth on the second double for Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely about the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little stuck in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost due to a cricket in the U.S., but he's not the first player who, because of frustration, would kill his own relationship to his rocket. I know Thanassi pretty well and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he was really very good at it, because he was exposed to a very provocative situation in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he falls into a team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the dress, he's training hard, he's in a wonderful condition, he's a very stable and mature young boy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to look over Kyrgyz for an important match that starts on Friday, and states that "the mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the parent from Canberry to return to the team as a long-term table.
"In the first place we want our team to be completely focused on the fight and not on all the controversy around it [Kyrgios]," Healy says.
And I think that Nick got up very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people say, in the eyes of the public, he has made a number of terrible mistakes, and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time outside the broadcast, when he's able to think about it, is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
The European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders and holds migrants
Following the announcement of the state of threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who attempted to violate it so as to stop the flow of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and the Serbian authorities reacted rebelliously.
Those who spend an unknown period of time in the bands of the country between the two states are those who flee from domestic violence, settle and settle.
But there's a sense of frustration coming.
When the helicopter moves over them, migrants call together "Open Borders!" and supply the regular units of the Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water for protests.
Serbian Foreign Minister declares it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while they are still coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just an indirect concern.
During the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic says in Prague.
Concerns at the Hungarian-Serb border came the day after the 28-nation bloc did not come with a single immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching a possible agreement next month or at the end of the year, which the EU nations would adopt more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
Germany's Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria launched the European Union's special summit on Tuesday next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
The internal threat situation in two southern regions has given the authorities greater power to address the crisis and has allowed them to close the roads and speed up judicial cases of asylum negotiations.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijarto said that his country is also planning to build a fleet from the rest of the way along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to cross their country when the fleet is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped to pull the remaining wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months Hungary has become the main point of weakness and entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the President of the Government of Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are living a better life and not war refugees who are seeking protection, which is a view that is clearly different from other EU states including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize violations of the 4-metre area, which the government has left to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for longer prison time for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government poses a threat," Zoltan Kovacs spokespersons told reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
In this we are very clear: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army that was waiting for next week, but the Reporters Associated Press on the border have observed a heavy armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, Orbana's counsel for domestic defense, said that the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 already caught on the territory of the state.
They have been found using the damage to the area and are now accused of committing violations under new laws in police custody.
The authorities quickly left the plot fixed.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using the trailer covered by the rest of the door.
On the main border crossing of Roszke, chaos arose because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and caused pressure on people.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main road connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's review before Bernie Sanders reduced by half in the national vote
The former Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still holding a two-digit jump at the Democratic race on national nominations, but Senator Bernie Sanders is taking her jump.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of the democratic primary desires (down from 58 per cent), while Sanders is in the second place 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is receiving support from 15 per cent of the democratic primary wishes.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters claim that it is too soon to say that they are clear decisions which candidates will support.
But Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton lost ground under his feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders gained several.
Clinton maintains a big gap between women and calms down, but her management is getting worse.
Her support between men has been significantly reduced and Sanders loses only 5 points on her.
The benefits of Clinton with democratic voters have been exhausted for under 50 years and are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to his older wishes.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit jump in front of Sanders between the liberals, but now Sanders loses only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary will in all states says she would be very supportive of Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with certain awards and another 15% would only support her as a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's not surprising that Clinton's current intruders are, in particular, the intruders.
The views are mixed between those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would support it.
While 48 per cent of democratic primary voters say that they would be very supportive of Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in the open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), it follows that it is time to be the president of a woman (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this work (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
There is also a great possibility of election and harmony in problems.
While the Vice-President is considering a potential candidacy for the President, 57 per cent of the democratic primary wishes would like him to see - a third of them think he should not run again.
If primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the nomination of the party, the most frequent choice is Biden.
Between Clinton's supporters, she listed more than half Biden as their second choice, far from Sanders.
If Biden decides to ignore the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership will extend from 20 points to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic will sees Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
Bedene is far from the other, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely electorate is rising.
However, when it comes to the question of the candidate's greater importance, democratic voters prefer to deal with problems before a greater chance of election.
Like last month, neither a democratic candidate nor a potential candidate is an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key features among the primary voters of their parties.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Poor of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary desires do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, so twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have that opinion.
Primary democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in line with their ideological view.
As far as all these measures are concerned, there is no opinion on Sanders about the quarter of the democratic will.
As concerns the decision by Hillary Clinton on the use of her personal email and server as public secrets continue, most of the primary democratic wills are satisfied with her explanation of this matter and say that their overall view did not affect it at all.
But among the American public, it's a completely different story.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this issue was already divided in March, shortly after this problem emerged.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent of their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
It's mainly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
Although Clinton is perceived as honest and reliable among her party voters, this question remains a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 percent see her as honest and reliable, which is a decrease of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered volunteers don't think she's honest and reliable.
And at the same time 55 percent of registered volunteers across the country also don't see Trump as honest and reliable.
However, Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best leaders.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of fans didn't think of him.
The error rate for sample 351 primary democratic desires is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up behind Donald Trump in national elections
By Ben Carson approaching Donald Trump in CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the candidates in the most recent survey and the others are failing to look for support.
Voters from a number of Republicans all over the country continue to support the Trump court by the majority, with 23% of the support in the last CBS survey carried out before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The research also found that Carson is running well across demographic groups, and he is cutting Trump off among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the state governor of Ohio John Kasiche, is behind the Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's request for 10% support fell to the current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckbee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The error rate for sample 376 Republican volunteers in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and occurred in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson had improved and achieved 19% of the support between the Republics for Trump 32% of the aid.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
At Carson's rising trend, Trump decided to launch a neurosurgery in service, and Carson even apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump declared last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during a brotherly ritual at Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a charge of murder was filed against five people.
Brothers of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michaela" Deng at the beginning of the ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
The police say he had eyes tied up, he had a full 30-pound piece of sand on his pockets, and he was repeatedly bothered when he tried to reach the target over the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about the headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of Pi Delta Psi's brotherhood didn't call 911 right after Deng fainted, and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they found time to take over Dengo's clothes, expose his symptoms, and contact Andy Menga, the president of the state of brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner introduced the press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their equipment and basically gave preference to the welfare of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's life," chief Wagner said.
He couldn't bring him back to life, and he died the next morning.
According to the drinking news, Deng was repeatedly hit by a stupid object in his head, body and stamina.
"Over a lot of families have been devastated as a result of the twinnings, and at least one student dies every year because of the twinnings since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengo family, in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be responsible, and this step is important by the authorities.
The Grand jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be accused of assaulting the prosecution and criminal prosecution.
"We want to keep not only those involved, but in case there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or informally, we will also assume responsibility for it," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood disrupted its relationship with local branches.
This happens when Fed increases interest rates
The increase in interest rates will come and the bull market will collapse, debt revenues will rise and the economy will collapse.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it'll take.
For the economy, it specifically offers the story of a small source of time.
The recession came 11 months after the first increase in interest and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve System in increasing interest rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That's why US central bank officials stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the interest rate increases, but rather on how long it will take to normalise.
There are really more variables in the game.
Finally, however, members of the market can ensure that all speed increases can be exceeded.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'white money'," said Julian Jessop, the global economy leader of Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to the normal but still low, creating a seismic shock that many might fear.
That means it's going to have adverse effects.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
In view of what the market has recorded in the last cc month, the expected increase in rates may make the air a little unsteady.
But once the increase occurs, the effect won't be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend towards re-stopping the stock after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the gap in monetary policy again," analysts Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the increase in the Fed.
More precisely, the market over the last 35 years is often - about 14 percent - aimed at increasing rates in a relatively high rate of 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent) and then returns to the normal state after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to Bob Doll's recent analysis, the main action strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock has a tendency to become more pronounced later in the interest rate increase cycle and the return is beginning to decrease.
Recese is a real economic life, but increases in rates often help her.
At present, Fed faces certain conditions that have not yet existed and that could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable is that a rough domestic product near its lowest point in history as the rate of Fed increases.
According to Deutsche Bank, at 118 interest increases since 1950, the nominal annual GDP growth was only twice below 4.5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 per cent, little to expect its maintenance, when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 per cent, says Atlanta Fed.
Increased rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "if this time is different," said Deutsche.
The market participants were preparing for the growth of Fed all year round, and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Committee for the Free Market, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve growth at this meeting, future trading only indicates a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the climbing cycles have been in the super cycle of increasing the bundle effect with the GDP covering the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this was a clearly slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far longer than the Fed expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are 74 months and we continue.
A firm profit was also volatile because the market expects interest increases and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the stock is experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more visible in bonds than in actions when the Fed changes policy direction.
In the case of bonds, the income appears to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the cycle, the rise in the income of the bonds fell immediately," Deutsche said.
The strategic Charles Schwab believes that the increase in interest rates is due to the approximation of income between long- and short-term bonds, which is equal to the curve.
The high-income bonds often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful to push the yield," stated in her analysis Kathy Jones, a firm analyst for fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adapted to the expectations of the Fed policy.
"In addition to the strengths of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlooks of stricter monetary policies," she wrote.
The short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is larger, the credit spread has expanded and the volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed deepens policy.
In general, companies that conduct most of their business in the United States win after the increase in interest rates and local products become more attractive.
The supranational company will make a lot of debt worse because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the area of the world market and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of the action tends to prevail over the three months after the initial increase in rates," analysts Goldman Sachsve said in the customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets had a low level of development companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital income, as well as low-volatility stocks, also exceeded their benchmarks by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of mobile interest rates lose most," Goldman said.
Besides purely action games, consumers also want due to the rising dollar.
The contestants can also see their profits through higher incomes, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, deputy Andrew Bingham
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham criticised this station for "assembly"
It seems to me that the more incomprehensible he is than his commercial rival.
He also focuses on BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British
Ambassador Damien Collins attacked Voice and says he's not the original idea.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" in Classic FM, claims first MP and gathers fresh pressure on broadcasts to prove they're doing something that commercial broadcasts don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public service broadcasting station seems to be "aggravated" and is still more unrecognizable than his commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be--I don't like using the word "assembled"-- but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seemed to be Britain under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that attack me, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," said Bingham.
The director-general of the BBC accused of denying the fact that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial rival with regard to live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 would not teach on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and creating music is actually at peak level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radia 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, the governor of BBC Radia 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire because of smuggling on foot to commercial competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
See why this program is being discussed as a non-original and not a particular one?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith aBoy George as a judge - was produced "as typical for BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own state" when he's going to start a fun series next.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of more future series of The Voice series or the loss of the money of licensees' fees in other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and may be guilty on Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month the lowest growth has been recorded since the year 2000 started the record itself
Internet sales increased three years ago due to mobile purchases
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for the braking of the loss
More than a decade ago, virtual shopping was on the rise, and thanks to it, many of the main British streets became cities of spirits.
However, experts claim that there are signs of online sales fixing, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August was the lowest growth increase since the beginning of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of online sales fixing, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth level in the past years and go back to 2000, the state has always rationalised over time," says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG market index.
It explains that internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the couch.
But now (growth) is slowing down, and that's why it looks like it's slowing down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been conquered from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could withhold purchases from this event, which will take place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average buyers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and agree to several sales websites.
Experts believe that black Friday, through which buyers recontract, can keep customers from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products, such as TVs and towels, more than one third of sales are carried out via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online, instead of buying in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried victims of the fall of the mine in Mecca and the family of Bin Ladina was sentenced
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred by the streets of the Muslim during the first burial in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially pours wine for the collapse of the construction magnet Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health stated that a total of 394 people were also injured after the earthquake
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a fall in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed to a certain degree in white, the mourners chose the road and gave up the sacrifice when the first of the fallen came on their last road to the graves in Al-Moais.
The sad message went through the holy place, where only a few days earlier, the construction site fell to the ceiling of the mixture and turned to the believers.
The body was released for burial, and the Saudi king sentenced the building group of bin Ladina over the disaster, which also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the hives in Grand Central Moscow in Mexico were carried by the streets
Among the dead was the father of four Qasim Akram children from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first journey when the tomb fell.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Moscow with his parents before the start of the annual haj journey.
Saudi officials have already promised that the hajj will take place in Mecca, and thousands of people are still entering the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group shouldn't have left the shoulders of a mine on top when it wasn't in operation.
The Arabic version of the statement, not with the state operated by the Saudi Press Agency, indicates that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the fall.
The English service of the disc agency did not disclose this detail, but stated that travel abroad was prohibited to the heads of the company.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the mine into the Grand Mosque courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were covering before the Hadj journey later this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the mine and its representatives were not made available for comment.
The Royal Statements also accused the group of not using the latest security measures and of lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
The tens of graves surround Grand Moscow in Mecca, which is part of the massive construction effort in front of Binladin Group.
Binladin's family was close to the Saudi government's family for decades and are carrying out large construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda Usáma bin Ládin was the son of a junkie whose family was abandoned in the 1990s.
Havary became in the middle of a strong wind and rain only a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on the road, which must at least one time in life graduate every capable Muslim.
Officials say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£ 174,000) will be attributed to relatives of the killed and the same amount for permanent injuries.

Chief B&Q claims that Eastern European traders are already working for a cheap trend
The British continue to employ more handicrafts, says Veronica Laura
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
As a result, 200 Screwfix shops focused on traders are open
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets all over the country
Rupert Steiner, main correspondent for Daily Mail
Brits put off money and money and hand it over to trained East European traders to work at home.
If you're dealing with a bet or a painter's bet, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are still more employed by the tradesmen to do the sewing work at home, according to the company's head of Screwfix B&Q.
Veronica Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns a network for domestic needs, claims that the large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops focused on traders and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laura claims that she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better half.
Most male workers are currently employed.
She said there was a need to highlight the growing demographic trends that show more female households that are making more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "We still have a lot of men working in our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decisions on the purchase of goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, who is one of only five women in the cormorants of the leading companies according to the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her peak team to reflect equality between the director of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having half the representation of women between employees including executive and financial directors.
Mrs. Laura says, "It was a conscious decision - the diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher announced a loss as a profit in half of the year and sold after the group took the cost of closing the stores.
As a result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new shops
The weekly contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in danger.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of accountability.
The president of the ODS Zbyněk Stanjura MPs noted that a one-time contribution seems good, but for a long time it would be better to be in the standard valuation because it would also be shown for years.
"We have room to find the mechanism that we're going to set up," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michael Marks (CSSD), which was to be valued next year over the scope of the law.
Marks' contribution was based on an argument that would improve the social situation of pensioners who do not think they are pink.
The higher valuation next year would mean the budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating each trillion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (CSSD) recalled that in the past, the rate of valuation has decreased.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal did not address the reduction of real income in 2016 and later.
This right of payment in December makes it very complicated and perhaps impossible, he said.
The president of the ČSSD Roman Sklenák MPs therefore proposed a shorter time limit for the discussion of the standard in the committee for 10 or 20 days, and also blocked that right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should amount to a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
Money is to go from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in particular.
In the next year, the income should increase on average about the stockpiles.
The contribution should be made according to the income novelty of people who will have a claim for income or part of it in December.
They could get it, as well as those who lost their pension claim in December before they paid it.
However, they would have to apply in writing for the supplement, and not later than the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valued for ice, which is about price growth and a third of real wages growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 per cent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 per cent.
According to the State Final Account 314,7 billion crowns, the state's old-age income was about five billion more per year.
Expenditure on old-age income was 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all statutory expenditure.
The average total old-age income of the year increased according to data in the State Final Account of 104 to 10,714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Administration has secured the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 moderate-income pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned his plans in his political career, he's going to dedicate himself to science.
The Senate chair, however, had a billionaire according to the Russian media quite certain.
In the Council of the Federation, he was to represent the Zapadorus Kaliningrad Region, whose Governor Nikolaj Cukanov as the candidate of the government of the United Russia held his post in Sunday's elections with a review.
According to the Russian laws, senators do not choose citizens, but they choose to be governors of three candidates, whose names will be announced before the governor's elections.
After the election, the senator of three candidates will choose for himself.
The complication for Jakunina was that in the Kaliningrad area, he didn't do as required by the law for 20 years.
The Kremlin found an exception for Jakuna, with the exception of being an extraordinary and powerful ambassador, on which the legal requirement for a long-term stay does not apply.
The film of the Czech comedy Theory Tiger is over.
The last stroke in the chairmanship of the main hero is the voluntary death of his tent, to which power and patience came.
Granny - Iva Janžur has decided on Grandpa's life, age and burial.
Jan is clear that he is on a similar path with his wife, Olga - Eliška Balzer.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live again with dignity and freedom.
They strive to get the government back over their lives - and as a solution to the choice of escape from this modern one, he led to the story of Slavik.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would be Bartovski, with whom he had already collaborated on the Invisible series.
Still, the actor who appeared before the camera after a long break associated with the rehab after a serious illness surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I gave him a script and he said he likes how sad he is.
And he surprised me that he's probably a fucking sportsman.
Before the filming, he always asked where to sit.
This time he rode on a bike, walked down the stairs and even walked up the hill.
And that's all in record tropical waters, the director's undercover.
According to Bartoška, women take a tiger to make a rabbit out of it in time.
They're gonna feed him a little bit, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't happen to play outside the rabbit on a tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film, the actor commented.
His wife, who can act slightly negatively on the viewers, created Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also nice, smart, empathic, and she thinks it's good.
But at the same time, she's a stalker and wants her husband dead, subjugated Bajgar.
The film parallels the fates of Jan's married daughter Olinka and Alenka - Tána Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the daughters of Erika and Pepika - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech TV and Rhłas and TV Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The American Internet company Google has promised to provide up to $5.5 million (132.6 million CZK) to organisations that help thousands of refugees travelling to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday at Google.org, which is a charity for this internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled Telick's part of the visit to criticise human rights violations.
The Czech MP of the European Parliament for the movement of the ANO Pavel Tellička has postponed a Thursday's journey to Baku, as the Azerbaijani authorities have now cancelled the official part of his visit.
According to Telika, this is the reason why the EP resolution last week criticises the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan, which Telika was co-author.
By decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telicka discussed the possibility of talks with the official partners and also the visit of political prisoners, which depend on the approval of the authorities, explained in his press statement, his Brussels office.
The road, which was planned several months earlier, wanted to use Telica to meet with the leadership of parliament and executive representatives, and also with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, clarified the text sent by the CTC.
The EP resolution condemns "invisible repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
She called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political prosecution.
The resolution was adopted shortly after a recent decision on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadijjo Ismail, who was committed to discovering corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out that it builds its flight base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not exclude from his visit Novosibirsk that the Russian air base in Syria would be established in the future.
We don't have plans like that yet.
But nothing is excluded, he declared.
Russia already has an airport base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which has so far been used as a service and logistics centre.
According to Russian press reports, from the beginning of August, supplies of Russian weapons and military material to Syria stopped.
According to Moscow, the arms shipments resulting from the current trade agreements are:
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base in Latakia, which for the time being remains the heritage of Syrian President Bashar Asada.
But Washington has no specific military intentions of Russia in Syria quite clearly, American commentators agree.
US Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke to Russian colleague Serge Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, and it was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is released to Moscow to explain concerns about the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The White House speaker Josh Earnest marked Asada's support for Moscow's lost bet.
Russia's policy objectives in Syria have stated that they are more unclear.
According to him, Moscow from Syria made its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a longer-term goal, but what, according to Ernesto, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is to be the main theme of Putin's talk, according to today's speculation of the Russian press, at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in Donbasa.
According to The New York Times today's report, the American government does not rule out that President Barack Obama and the Russian President could meet at the UN meeting.
The views among White House's councils are still in progress.
The Tass agency today, referring to the words of the Kremlin speaker Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin had not yet had a meeting with Obama on the program of his New York stay.
Put sesame oil on the stomach diet, the rope helps strengthen immunity.
Good way to increase the strain of unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when the seeds are harvested.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of the health diet, such as gums.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics, the Czech Republic has been the most frequent cause of the death of Czechs for several years.
The stomach ulcers are mostly affected by women, helping with sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of the Asian cuisine, you must not miss some sesame oil, which is part of the original recipe for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in heat-adjusted meals and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in stomach diet.
The essential fatty acids that contain are good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% of the cause of stomach inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, stomach problems are especially related to overweight people who do not carry and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be used successfully for liver diet, which is very similar to that stomach.
If people want to benefit from all the health benefits of this oil consumption, they should pay attention to products from exotic food trades.
Producers from Asia often use overripe seeds that have a more pronounced taste.
But oil is about all the active substances, according to Ladislav Haczecký, the Czech executive director of Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovska, which produces organic virgin oil sold for cold.
The company also produces fresh sesame oil and uses unsolicited seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our fox will be able to extract 8 kilos of the season.
By mechanical screening, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra panning.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil thrives in heart disease and bowel.
The Czech favorite among the oil is the sunflower.
From Jarmily Hamer's research at the University of Masaryk, it turned out that he prefers 43% of respondents in the hot kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for a reduction, starting to overheat at 180 °C.
For example, it is better to use it for salads and is especially suitable for diets, where it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which reduce cholesterol from all fatty acids the most.
In the case of heart problems, attention should be paid to the amount of total fat and calories.
For example, in one spoon of sunflower oil is 62 calories, in the spoon of rape oil is 99 calories.
With regard to the energy value of food, it is important to realize that the natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than the so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
That's why it's appropriate to go after extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as the moon and the moon for nine months.
The storage in the refrigerator is still prolonged.
The old oil people know especially from a burning taste.
On the contrary, there's no loophole at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Coconut oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technical know-how are used for so-called superfoods, and therefore the oil is considered to be the most healthy of plant oils.
For this designation, it thanks to the maximum content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot produce themselves and one must take them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, instead the Icelandic take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Common oil is suitable to be classified in the food container as part of a diet that supports strengthening immunity and healing wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cellular membranes.
People don't have to be afraid of using rope oil, they don't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that he found this oil road to consumption confirms the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
He sells 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon extra hard after the wound.
Soap oil is not a tasteful one, but it is a great boost to immunity, advises Daniel Vlček of the great company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, they're the most passionate people in America.
There's 1.4 grills in one house.
Then all over the world, there are the most varied competitions in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
They're not even Czech.
On the basis of consumer research in the Czech market, we find that only 4% of the people in the world were non-aggressive.
The absolute majority of them then griffins several times a year.
To make the grilling successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the seams a few hours before the heat adjustment.
Which oil is most suitable for this, and at the same time, when it is grilled, will leave the health of a beneficial substance?
It is generally true that during the grilling process itself, you should be treated.
Experts agree that much of the oil is starting to lose its flavor at high temperatures.
The healthy extra virgin oil then comes also from the body of a beneficial substance, which is otherwise obtained when it is consumed by oil from meals that are adjusted at lower temperatures.
This does not mean, however, that extra virgin oils will not find their application in grilling.
Terrible oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When the meat is said, a terrible oil is immediately supplied to experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovsk.
It adds to the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen there is a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for roasting and grilling, as it has a high burning rate up to 216 °C.
Even at this high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils preserves the health of a beneficial substance, describes the benefits of the terrible oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this oil from the vine.
Experts agree that rose oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating cholesterol surpluses.
Our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals in the vegetable oil.
Due to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism, and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
We also help to enhance our external beauty - it improves skin elasticity, it is used in the treatment of liver and helps to care for dry and fragile hair.
The chefs are pleased to use the vegetable oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold meals, for example when cooking salads, but also for the heat adjustment of meals.
In grilling, then, it can be used in two ways, in marinating and in its own grilling.
We keep the meat and the fish safe.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of the marina: oil, acidity and roots.
For example, we add acid to the apple octopus and we aim at mixing the meat.
The root adds a mass of flavor and oil preserves and supplies the right crop, says Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that terrible oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils, it can break through dark meat.
So the marined meat or fish are ready to grill, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are indicated by the fact that only a few capes are sufficient to prepare meals.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils are a simple taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, flax, and rape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before the grilling itself, shake the oil, prevent the burning of food.
The necessary part of the grilling is also the preparation of the annexes.
The grilled mass and fish fit practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
For example, chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend salading Horke summer.
You need: • 1 pcs of broccoli • 1 chain of hands • 1 cup of pasta • 1 cup of mixture of salad leaves • 3 juices of vegetable oil
Add to the salad meat to a mixture of salad leaves with a towel, curdled hooks and on large cubes with a towel.
Depending on the taste of the sun and the opera, you can also taste the mint chilli and the soy sauce.
Finally, dig a few drops of rose oil.
For exceptional taste, then you can salad with finely baked almonds.
Several sclerosis: depends not only on the medicine but also on the patient’s will to fight.
Several sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergot therapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation if they are to have a child, care for these sick ones also includes social advice, recommendations for the adjustment of housing, etc.
However, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can affect the patient as a matter of principle.
The longer the disease is active, the longer it can work, the more it doesn't have to change the style of its life.
As doctors have pointed out, the patient’s commitment to the disease releases space for activity.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement significantly distances the time when the patient needs some compensation aid, such as a shelter.
It is important that patients and their surroundings not be subject to various myths, for example, that the disease is automatically leading to the end of the vehicle.
And that's why the site was created. Give it a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give it a chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In a few sclerosis, it has been suggested twice that the sooner the disease begins to heal, the more the doctor can influence.
That's because we have medications on multiple sclerosis at an inert stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we get hit, the greater the hope is that we will be able to stop the disease and remove the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves lower limbs or imbalances.
It works with patients according to their individual needs: maintenance of the condition, improvement of the pace, strengthening of the pancreas, mitigation of swallowing disorders or improvement of coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the particular patient's difficulties," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, primary clinical rehabilitation and physical medicine Faculty of Hospitals in Motole.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it occurs in a different way in each case.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
However, the movement activity also reinforces the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive regular exercise is the fact that the sick are verifying what they can do, and it enhances their self-confidence.
"Endorphines are also washed out during exercise, and a person feels well after it," warns PhDr. Kamila Rásová from the Rehabilitation Clinic Faculty Hospital of the Royal Vineyard.
By affecting the physical site, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotion.
That's how we get into the psychiatry and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it adds.
"In the past these patients have been treated so well, today we know they need a targeted burden," says Professor PaedDr. PaedR. Pavel Kolář, the priority of Rehabilitation Clinic and Body Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
The aim of physical therapy is to keep a person as self-employed as long as possible, including employment.
Physical therapists therefore cooperate with ergot therapists so that each person can get compensation aid with his ear in peace.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult situation.
When you get a serious illness, most people get it.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
She has to respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sick soul, we have to follow someone, not try to get rid of everything in our own misery.
"I work with them in such a way that they finally conclude that even with disability, life can be meaningful and that a limited sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubert from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty of Hospitals in Prague.
Without the Prague latecoere manufacturer, airbuses wouldn't fly.
Aviation production is a synonym for accuracy and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which can't be manufactured and processed immediately.
However, next to super-precious, computer-controlled machines, along with autoclaves for composing composites, it is possible to hit something as common as meroon picks.
In the drum, which reminds us of a sugar vat, in a pack of ovens, the boundaries of the folds that have just come out of the milling machine are popular.
"No one has come to a better conclusion," laughs Ivan Dubský, Director General of the manufacturer of the latecoeer aircraft doors.
In the area in Prague, the previous Summer complete door for Airbus A320 is produced.
As the only ones in the world, they deliver the door to Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, which are part of Prague, also enter passengers into the first and higher class on the upper decks of the largest aircraft of the Airbus A380.
Here are the doors full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Preciseness is the main motto here.
Maybe the current key lets the company run twice a year.
If the yellow sticker is missing a check record, the Prague competition should explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing who drive regularly to determine whether the doors are manufactured in accordance with the agreed rules.
But advanced technology hasn't completely fooled people.
On one door to A320 there are 1500 knots.
The netizens have to cut their hands.
It takes them two days.
And according to the sound of the falling bet, they know if it's already properly torn apart.
The tolerances in which they move are minimal.
The net may come from zero to 0.13 millimetres above the surface of the aircraft.
That's about twice the fat of human hair.
There will be a number of trained hmats in control.
When the controller passes the finger in a row of nails, he knows if there's any outside tolerance.
Then we take the exact angle.
Flying before 1989 was a program of the L-39 military aircraft exercise.
But in 1991, not one was produced.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
At that time, it was combined with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
Wins selection of emergency door suppliers for model A321.
The contracts with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were for them at that time a small company that did not have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable deliveries," Dubsk recalls.
The door to the US producer would be slammed if Latvia did not give up in 1999 at the Prague International Association of Aeronautical Industries conference of the French group Latecoere.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day the conversation with the French began, says Dubsk.
A year later, Latecoere bought a Czech company and a strong company came up with new orders.
The assembly of the parts of the door for A320 was immediately expanded in 2000.
Three years later, the upper deck door for A380 arrived.
In 2006 the company built a new hall for composition processing for Boeing Dreamliner supplies.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't be able to make these big orders ourselves.
Maybe we could do parts or a little part.
Partners want security supplies for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubsk.
Last year, the Czech Latecoeer achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after taxing 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between the supplier of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoe in Prague has invested 1.5 billion crowns since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special manufacturing processes and certificates of qualification for key staff.
Without them, the firm would not have built any doors to the aircraft.
Get certificates that production processes meet customer requirements, and keep them in repeated checks according to the Dublin millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more precise and tighter.
We need to train employees, equip the equipment and re-certify the whole process, he adds.
The company is now finalizing the process of decomposition with zinc and nickel, which replaces the existing harmful cadmium for human health.
The tasks were given by the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the devices or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing are coming, checking the concepts of the whole line.
Then we'll lead them the production.
They're checking our labs, too.
One set of samples are tested by themselves in their laboratory and then the results are compared to ours, approaching the Deep way the receivers control them.
In return, the Prague companies are long-term exclusive contracts.
The Prague race is standing today and the production of the Embraers is falling.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.
The replacement of the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But it doesn't mean he could say any price at the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It shows how many doors one will stand after ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We've got to get into this price sample.
If we don't, we'll make it, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where electric boxes are completed for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft, is still empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
A new semi-robotic line for use is built here, and the door is mounted for an innovative model A320 Neo.
It's going to be faster and faster.
"This is the trend that the assembly in aviation is taking off," explains Dubský.
The rest of my future line is secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of a new A320 model.
Only a few meters away will create a line for the complete mounting door for the upper deck A380.
It's our parent company's strategic decision.
The aim is to cut production time and reduce costs.
Full installation could start in two years, says Dubsky.
Before doing so, however, the company must pass the qualification tests as required for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also committed to further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should be part of the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company when it can also process compositions in addition to metal materials," Dubsk says proudly.
Latecoere, however, is available in the Czech Republic on the basis of production capacity.
There's no other place in Letov's area where he's staying.
Prior to the French mother's entry, the company had 180 employees.
Now he's 800, and within three years it could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of schedule, the number of new aircraft each year doesn't have to be afraid.
Although he had orders for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague's latecoere was facing the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the January payment of the loan.
Finally, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main believers.
At the end of August, some of their loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors received an increase of €57.4 million in the company's share of 37.4 per cent.
The company's debt dropped by two thirds, which is 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company signed a new shareholding of EUR 222.9 million between the current shareholders.
Totally, the base capital amounted to EUR 280 million.
However, the whole group is looking for the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which share 85 per cent in the markets.
The average contract growth is expected to be four per cent per year until 2017.
The contract book has orders of 2.6 billion euros, corresponding to the four-year production.
The French media argues that latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the capacitors.
The Czech race in the Prague Latvians is important for groups.
The Group contributes 16 percent to the market.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign side of the group.
The envoys supported a greater share of the state's carbon charges.
The change in interest rates for the interest rate is expected to bring in a government deposit of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
According to the government, the budget revenue of the municipalities is to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the year preceding, the municipalities received around 450 million crowns and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
In the coal industry, there were about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns in the state.
Novela is also calculated by increasing the compensation from the area of production with a permissible weight of thousands of crowns per hectare per year.
The receipt of these grants shall continue to be to the full extent of the municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (CSSD) told the MPs that this meant that the country received 14 million to 100 million crowns each year.
The amount of the fee will no longer be fixed by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The refund shall be recalculated as a component of the amount of depleted non-growth and the rate for each type of non-growth.
According to the government, the change is due, inter alia, to a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the envoy of the ODS Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a fee by a government regulation should not be in accordance with the constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládka, this is not the case because the state is paying the interest that is a state's property.
Fees shall be granted only to the municipalities whose territory is affected by the demand.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the city and a quarter of the state will receive money.
The same ratio will be true in the case of radioactive ovens.
Part of the money that you can make on the fee of your choice will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage to demand or to ensure a banishment service.
Today's proposal was criticised by the opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that they would harm the villages affected by the greed and the countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Oldosts) warned that businesses would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities just as much as they do today because they would pay higher fees directly to the government budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in the Ústek region.
Before the rise of unemployment in the Mostecka, the KSČM M.H.A.A. warned the M.A. Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulička failed to propose to refuse the novel, but Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to work.
The explanatory report states that, according to the companies concerned, the increase in fees does not lead to coal prices, as prices are more than 90 per cent of the duration of the contract.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heaters, should therefore not feel any price growth.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that trade unions will compensate for the increase in wages to reduce their operating costs, which in particular would mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
According to it, however, the increase in wages from the point of view of employment is negligible.
According to the report on the news of Milan Urbana (CSSD), it is key for the Members to know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal.
If the coal is stretched beyond the limits, it will have an impact on the income for the state and the country, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Youth that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovakian army should fall until 2020.
The limits below ČSA should be broken for social, national and long-term domestic energy stability.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase interest rates first after almost a decade.
The 80 economists surveyed by the Reuters agency found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now believe that they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates of 0-0.25 per cent.
It's a historic event because it's been sitting for years since the Fed reduced its rates to zero.
First, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of zero-flight and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of Peterson's Institute for the International Economy.
The US economy was relatively good, there was a recovery in the form of the addition of trillions of dollars to the state account and the creation of only a low level of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned markets to be ready for an increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see a great chance against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEC.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day and his colleague - wrote a message stating that he was "flight" his first murder and that he wanted to be able to take it back, revealed it to government authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier in Mississippi reported that Lamb, a professor of geography and social science at the State University of Delta, called the police on Monday morning about ten o'clock
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb's dispatcher asked him to send cops to his house.
He said, "Last night I shot my wife" and he also mentioned that there is "a cute dog" in the house, which "will not poison anyone" but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why he was shot in the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss found a handwritten message from Lamb saying: “I’m so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the post, Lamb spent 300 miles on his way to Delta University, where he killed teachers of history Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Dékan University William LaForge said he did not know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was obviously something in Mr. Lamb’s head.”
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss's romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities stated that there was "no evidence" about the "loving triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentis in seven years, said she was "a great person".
There was a divorce 15 years ago, but both of them remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was completely "crushed".
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as told by Sun Herald, was working with Prentiss from home over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentissov, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, had been with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," she let herself hear Knowles.
The police said Lamb talked to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to jail.
When the police caught him on the street near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he was shot.
According to a biography published on the school’s website, Lamb won a doctorate in the field of education at Delta University in spring 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Magic
Herec (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
He also reportedly had a drug problem, and in 2008 he was detained for drug possession.
All these things are definitely choosing their own tax.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be several months out of the game for a double break.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the Manchester United defeat in the League of Masters against the PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this injury in tears and removed it from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused Héctor Morena's inconceivable move in 15 minutes when a 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV space.
Nine minutes was treated at the playground and an oxygen mask was also needed before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double fracture of his legs and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe in the afternoon and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester in 18 years, it's very difficult, but it plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the closet, he also had an oxygen mask.
It's a joke.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty cup.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexicans.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad move on both feet.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thanks to everyone for their reports, words can't express how destroyed I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will return even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeating PSV
The British defence will have added motivation to re-establish the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, coach PSV, said, "It was a very serious injury."
If any player leaves the game with such an injury, each one is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match for Mexico against Van Gaalo the Netherlands at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponents, and when you hear about the seriousness of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I wasn't able to spot this moment.
I saw only the ball that directed the other way, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched him, but I didn't see a move on Luke.
In the SBS6 interview, Morena said, "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel so bad about it, I'm so sorry.
Player PSV Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's move.
David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?
This is what every parent knows: When a child loves a book, it doesn't take long to learn to remember it.
Of course, you can't be David Cameron.
On the question of children's schematics to name a favorite children's book, the president of the Government of Lorax, a fairy tale from Dr. Seuss, from 1971.
It was difficult to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Writable, delicate, creative and with strong content, I loved reading to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had not seen before."
Well, until then, in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the story according to the 2012 movie elevator, which added other characters and details to complete the text in a short original.
"In the town of Thnead-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a compost, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl's dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the true tree," is a book that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if the same was not quite suspicious, the text added by Cameron is read as a total lift of the Lorax film, which is on the website of the Movie Database, and begins by saying: "In the town of Thnead-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a compost, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his girl dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would get to know the story of a book, where the unnamed young man will learn that the local nature is devastating the predatory, the trees of an industrialist Once-ler, who, despite protests by the title Lorax, a crooked, horny creature who "speaks about the trees."
With the highest probability of so little significant PR task, an assistant who has never read Lorax's child 20 times in a piece.
Speaking Downing Street reported that the text probably came from Cameron's rank office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text provided the employee of Cameron, but without any further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of warning England, but still holding
Coping with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after looking at the team that England has chosen on this tour, I think the replay of defeat 3-0, which she suffered last in the trial series, is unlikely to happen.
I wouldn't rule out the guest victory either.
The side of Alastair Cooka can be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good spin-players in this pancreatic complex and also collective thinking is strong; no scars from 2012, only youth positive.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing with a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth got out of the English team in the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam Lyth is a hard one for me to analyze, because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were opposed to two good attacks under demanding conditions and easy, but the hard reality is that the players are grounded in crickets on the basis of performance.
For example, around the name Joe Root, there were no questions, which led to the announcement, because — and I have mentioned earlier — players are their best selections.
A few more centuries and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Let's hope that if he can get more running for Yorkshire, another opportunity will appear.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performances were not quite thorough, and I'm not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time the thumb gets to prove is a hard one.
Lyth got seven hats — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance home and out.
The only thing you can stop for is that England gave Jonathan Trott’s first chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best form — but this missed opportunity is already the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and this is a doll I value very well.
It's a x-factory cricket player that we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he did so little.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all of this will, of course, depend on the overall composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when Moeen starts on the side of Cook, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was overcome and I don't have any excuses against her.
I don't understand why strikemaker can't fire and this left-wing man has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 and there's no big difference in it.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before his release in 2001.
He was immediately succeeded for three centuries, and he didn't even look.
There's Zafar Ansari on the team as a backup sponsor, and when I was able to track him, he took me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — on average 31 with a ball and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a puzzle, but there are not many spinners who raise their hands, and the electorate decided for the young.
They'll learn a lot about this tour.
Despite the team, England seems to have made several changes and smart additions to their training staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardenea, the Sri Lankan Colonel, as a consultant for the trials can be a masterly tach.
He is one of the most beautiful players who bring rich experiences by having experiences with all conditions and attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the part of the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and unlovable spark.
I always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intelligence that can be used.
New voices in the closet, although they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes slow down and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham Ben Stokes's partner got a day off, as Root got a similar break against Australia, and I don't have a problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy began to stagnate by 2017.
The unimaginable renegotiation strategy of David Cameron for maintaining Britain in the EU is getting into other problems with every passing day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn headed the Working Party, or will come to the TUC on Tuesday to bring the whole situation around Europe to the parade.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is suffering in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agendas, shared concessions and disruptive changes to the treaties that most of them did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they would not want social protection.
We can even call it the own agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the office go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo before a famous local monument, with or without local values, and then return home with the words that they win the reform alliances.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain to be a freelance in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German carefully balanced office, is an associate, but she was in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets bad, as it was for too long thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
The Frenchman François Hollande faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's hard to see how they beat their legs with the help of Selfie Brits, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Britain to speed up the Brexit process, a hard friend.
"The re-agreement has solved the problem" and "British has nothing valuable from the negotiation."
Europeans know for their own harm how ancient Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU are printing oligarch barons, because they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benny in 1975, which supported our 1973 entry in terms of 2:1.
They can remember the name Boris Johnson, a prominent Euro-opportunist who made his name as a Brussels rapporteur "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his ingenuity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included mixtures of non-payments, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo non-sea departments that owned most of the big news.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn't have you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameroon's referendum routine since Blair allowed the principle of an EU Constitution to be abolished by French and Dutch voters in 2005.
The press never fired him either.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who took me on Monday at the Westminster, friends in the back - I told him that he should not waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of accepting the strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock's boycott, which was a mistake back then and now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marre, whose chair he left at the BBC Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I'll say it's nice, they're developing.
He claims to want to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the crazy trend of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderis can certainly come to this.
The same said Hilary "Bemm, but not Bennite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner shoe couldn't decide to admit that Corby's appointment as a shadow office was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70 ’ s when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's attack was much more attractive.
But fighting for us to remain "in all circumstances" - Benin's phrase - according to everything that McDonnell said, not even what the JC told his colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to tell - do not forget, touched me too - the discipline of the message remains important in the age of television throughout the day and especially in faith, the parishioner paranoia and the betrayal of social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free entrance to Europe, which would allow him to respect the support of the Working Party in the referendum campaign, of course, as McDonnell stated.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnellovo and Corby's fundamental declaration of EU membership - in line with their Bennite-based economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric debate between left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small differences is the central basis of dogmatic harassment.
As with his statement about Nata - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of it all for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - they also have suspected voters - because of British concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and even by reducing the costs of the conservative government by power, as I was reminded at the Monday's beginning of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise reviews of electronics published by Public Health England
The government's statement that electronic cigarettes are 95 % safer than smoking led to a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are connected to the tobacco industry, by researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "mechanical" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the scope of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and tobacco industry.
In the expert journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely chattel base", on which the agency PHE founded its main conclusions.
Two other experts, who wrote for BMJ, questioned the claim that was allegedly "based on rocks or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They suggest that the public could expect that the statement by the PHE agency, which is "the best estimate of the time, is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking", are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a meeting of 12 people authorized to prepare a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) of the model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of the discussion were summarised in the study report.
McKee and Capewell state that one of the sponsors of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general allegedly had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also approved the public health authority of BAT in the sustainability report, he said.
One of the 12 meeting participants has granted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not from funding that they allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE was also attended by tobacco management.
The report is produced in this group "explicitly admitted," missing "strong evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that saying PHE "there is no proof that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoking for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, stated that the BMJ claim had already been held responsible.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small, but we still need to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and also what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year of smoking and smoking-related diseases cost NHS £2 billion a year.
With a clear emphasis on current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not safe, they only carry a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should end with EastAnders, former director of Channel 4
Former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastAnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give right hand" for an emergency show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes that are not created by other British television broadcasts.
He criticised the BBC for having put in public service programmes, which are likely to follow only a handful of people, in complicated broadcasting times against its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After Director Tony Hall generally said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he was unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for six years that he worked on Channel 4.
"I'm fighting the idea that the BBC launches and broadcasts programmes that would certainly be broadcast rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the Communication Committee in the Upper House, as part of the BBC's future.
If you keep the licence fees that I am not sure are in the medium-term or long-term horizon of good thinking, the production should be reduced at least in terms of programs that others do not produce or produce.
They send The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get as wide support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would send it is a funny joke, and obviously unwise.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course made on the home floor.
Honestly, the other channels would give them the right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasts are.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at least.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that he felt guilty about making ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those who were former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more horrifying BBC public service programs "is passing on to BBC4, where it is quite often impossible to measure obscurity, but they fulfil their authority and can argue when they are going to justify their cover mission to £4bn from licensing fees, "But of course we are doing all these screening programs that nobody is looking at."
They're sending them out at a time when no one's looking at them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I urge you to find a more regressive system regarding who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that the 150 British pounds per year is a big sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at the BBC.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared in front of the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should review its Reith mission in the sense of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production has already been classified as education - it was 1% television production and 0.1% radio production - and should be taken as a model for public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, explain and entertain."
About the Elstein partnership, he said the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast on television only, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
“Sonogenetics” or control of brain cells by means of sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction the slides move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
A small slide changes direction at a time when sound impulses are affected, which are not audible to human ears.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
Scientists have stated that these worms are a great demonstration of a new methodology called sonogenetics that uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and is activated outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salt Institute in La Joll, California, reported to the Guardian that one day this method could replace a deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are in the patient's brain.
The glands usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would be delivered when placed into the liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, bubbles strengthen ultrasound waves that then pass through the worms' body.
The enhanced ultrasound waves occur in the ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate cells that are connected, the Nature Communications report states.
In order to control the glands using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the ion channels TRP-4.
Then, when using such modified worms ultrasound, the sound waves were reinforced by microbublins and transferred to worms where modified motor neurons were activated.
The new method is much like optics, a progressive tool that allows scientists to turn off and shut down neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, made it clear that sonogenesis could have many advantages against this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by optical fibre to the required position in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that his method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your threshold!
A British arms trade adverts.
Look at the video about the defence market from Amnesty International.
It's a horrendous killer drone!
The nails on the legs, which break the ankles!
Three-shots!
And electric stunning shoes that cause unbearable pain, but they don't touch any marks!
The joyful voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no one in doubt that this advertisement on the world's largest weapons fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to enhance the will of the British government to sell weapons to repression regimes through defense and security facilities at the International Veselice ExCeL Centre in the London district of Docklands.

But a solo campaign is also conducted with posters at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling to DLR from September 15th to September 18th?" read one, using letters with a London meter mark with DLR links becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, a series of arms dealers will join the DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop arms trade.
On 300 posters are created artists who present their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A collection called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute across London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen's key, which allegedly "will gain access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not required by this air mailing "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, the curator Cruel Designs and a professional assistant at the Essex University, artists are still more questioning and are trying to show political activity to spectators outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out of the real world to have their art impact on society.
Other anti-trafficking posters with health weapons traveling in the subway.
Video Amnesty was viewed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people within 24 hours and was created by a VCCP agency working without charge for the honorary and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent advertising about arms trade - saw an empty space in the calendar ExCeL - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that's trying to avoid."
They played with the creation of more realistic risk-taking corporate advertising, but "by adding solid colors and animation, I have learned that there are more people on the ground."
"They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is that the government of the United Kingdom takes action and ensures that the torture facility does not deal illegally with our thirst.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding arms trade comes from outside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In the press report, Saab revealed an order from the US army to "at the AT4CS RS. "
This includes "a uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects behind the burning inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life at Student College
11 years ago, I moved to a college as an unscrupulous 90-year-old boy who still believes in bartenders and moral relativism, but now I have the heavy smiles of those I've been treating - and many, long-standing complaints to others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the wheels can move from slightly to the nerves of the going to the totally depressing.
It's kind of silly to tell people where you're from, if you took a year's break, what you're thinking about Corbyn, and why "you don't truly love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from the HAHAHA, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help the others to breathe too - ask yourself and express your interest.
It's a conversation, and it'll help you find people you like, and those you wouldn't like, even if your races were in one fire, and they'd be publishing extinguishers.
Let the people have room.
People's rooms often change for drinking receptions, movie evenings and public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.

Introverts on high will come shortly.
Your room should be a haven of peace, yet a lot of people are changing their way into an outdoor walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to a lifelong friendship.
It could be hell for someone who needs to be offered.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can go back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to find out when a companion is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a place to lock him up.
When it comes to chatting, chatting.
One boy in my neighborhood was used to saying that if the door isn't locked, it's invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make friends through cooking.
Because you started going to the university at the top of the bakery mannequin, sticking to the foreign door, and showing the plate of sealed cookies seems quite less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, something I've given you, now smile while I'm going to ask myself personal questions."
Offering your own insights is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe it's all over so that your face will be suited to a pleasant surprise.
Of course, you're a decent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and gum are likely to prevent others from pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a regular crime in student colleges.
The theft of the whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is the drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Double check it with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're angry inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adults than my roommates, who exchanged their milk for the means to wash the utensils to punish the thieves.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that break people from sleep or study.
It's not only about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could shut down the drum and bass, because there were three at night and she had a letter in the morning.
Their response was to strengthen the music.
When they finally calmed down at 5:00 in the morning, she let them sleep for two hours and then left her own music loud, locked the door and went to her three-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future would go to the same college as you?
And on the contrary, would it not be extremely embarrassing if you were to confuse your fellow citizens for your future journey, sleep together, break up and have to see each day and maybe take control of your friends?
Of course, you don't order hearts - but if your sexy roommate is not your future though, at least try to talk to your weaknesses.
In an exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in his unclosed room, there's only a thin border between fun and joke.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Learn them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock them in the door and put their keys into the bottle with the water you pour into the freezer - but never glue their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eve was happy for twins, despite the unimaginable prospect of the future.
Eva has lived for a while in pregnancy with a seven - year - old Vitka.
His father broke up with her and she was alone for the preparation and education of her offspring.
With the situation, I was able to cope relatively quickly - I was very happy with the child and I was looking for a positive one.
Uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to get hurt.
And I'm sure I had the hope that we wouldn't stay alone for a long time today, Eve remembers her first pregnancy.
By then, she had met on the Internet in an old Vashka chat that they had started to talk to about favorite movies.
Your Eve and Vytka even brought home from the womb, but in the role of the innocent father, he didn't get too involved.
"Sometimes he got out of the program," Eva described in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The reason for the third series of Czech television is to look for luck for a second attempt.
The family’s care and financial security care were managed by the work on part-time care and large aid to the mother and aunt’s assistance.
Not even looking at the responsibilities of a foreign child at the end of Vaska's affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vitk's second birthday, and this one now understands Vashka as his father, and so does he.
Although Vasek already has two grown daughters, the fatherhood of 60 is using his words and is also more devoted to children.
Besides Vitka, there was another two-year-old Leondy and finally a two-year-old.
"Your family has been so naturally involved, perhaps by the fact that my mother never talked much about my relationship," she thinks she's smiling.
A little place?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born into the imperial line after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of biliary acids, which then appear in excess of the amount of blood pregnant and are particularly present in the presence of abstinence.
Miscarriage is dangerous for an unborn child, at risk of premature birth and death, in mothers after birth most of them self-restraint.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evin and Wasch, although they were only in the 36th week.
Emička was placed in an incubator in an intermediate department, where she also works in Vaskova's netizen, who was able to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after transporting her from JIP to the room, I had her with me, describing a demanding period after Eva's birth.
She spent twenty days in the womb until the doctors agreed to release a baby that, in the meantime, managed to reach a limit of two pounds.
Waiting for the children to be brought up in Eve’s womb did not bring joy.
"I was crazy about my husband and children," recalls a four-week-old mother.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, including because of the inadvertent approach of one of the doctors.
Eventually, however, it did not happen, and the doctors abandoned Eve and her twins to domestic care.
The events of four pregnancy and childbirths send ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45 hours.
A whole bunch of ordinary families are capable of accommodating themselves.
They live together in a small house not far from Prague, where Eva had to cope with electric twins and tight conditions.
The house did not grow, but Yoursek made Eve happy by installing a gas cook to make food preparation for six people more comfortable.
If it's hot, we'll take care of the cab.
Eva is convinced that children are especially involved in family recreation and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or size of the home.
For the time being, we've been very nice, better than we've been waiting.
Although the disorder is worse hidden in a small space and the cubing baby sometimes goes beyond us, but at least we're all close, she smiles at Eva, who can find a positive page on every situation.
Vaška's work as a lighting lamp in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes goes to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60s, according to his words, care for family finances and children physically manages how long will it be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be me once who will live this family," Eva admits on the balance in asking for the future.
She would like to go back to work, but she prefers even more the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly the place for the employer.
And when it gets worse, we can talk to your husband about a cab, joke about a nice blonde.
Apple did it.
For everything, there's a display.
The most efficient processor, a camera with a higher resolution, a stronger chassis or a display that recognizes the strength of touch, these are in short preference to the recent nine-generation iPhones.
The last two have also a negative impact on the size and weight of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The traditional trend of Apple was that every new generation of iPhones is easier than the previous one.
An exception were only a third and a fourth generation whose weight rose slightly against the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight of the difference in the failures of the news was, however, truly negligible.
But it doesn't pay far for new iPhones.
Unlike last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight grew by a smaller model of 14 grams, by a larger one of 20 grams.
On one side you can't be surprised, last year's affair with bending in Apple's pockets suffered a lot.
Shasi novelty is thus made of a more resistant clay sledge 7000, which was also expressed in weight.
But they have a much bigger impact on her.
Apple used 3D Touch technology in the news, as the display will reveal the strength of touch.
To this end, it was necessary to monitor another layer of capacity sensors.
The importance of new iPhone displays has increased more than twice over the previous generation.
For a smaller iPhone of originally 12 grams per 29 grams, in case of greater than 19 grams per 40 grams.
In iPhone 6s, the display is so difficult to use as a component.
The weight of only 143 grams was then also achieved in this news thanks to the evaporative skin that affected most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, then, the most difficult component used is the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way against the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is just visible at the display.
Weight 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
How much new technology will be practical, it will appear when used.
The first users will be able to test it on Friday, September 25, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will begin in selected countries.
Are the champs having breakfast for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have succeeded in finding an interesting possibility.
They found traces of the settlement of modern man from different times, including painted paintings, the rest of the tools and so on and so on.
In the 23A layer, which is dated to about 30 thousand years ago, scientists have discovered something that is very memorable for the rest of the breakfast buffet.
On the spot, there were traces of oats, which are likely to pass through the production process of so popular fibers today.
With it, the seeds are washed first today, then dried, ridded, so-called pollen, then washed and dissolved.
In the cave of Paglicci it was possible to discover grains that were burnt or washed, and then apparently torn between two millstones - at least this suggests the rates of use on two rocks in the cave.
Scientists have thus failed in their publication for the magazine PNAS to prove that in the cave, a complete process of the production of fibers would be carried out, but the similarity is really very imaginary.
We also don't have any evidence of how people were able to eat fibers, but the belief that it was with some liquid and perhaps even heat, of course, is quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting evidence of how intensively people used crops long before agricultural production.
If, therefore, the fleet interpretation is correct, the oldest fleets preceded agriculture for about twenty thousand years.
New report of the stations in the Transport Company of Brna.
So once again I listened to the report of the name of the station in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Přizak, Frázova, Spratecká.
Of course, trolleybus was a little louder, so reporting by a male voice was somewhat less understandable than before when stops were reported by a female voice.
Women's voice is higher, so in the deeper traffic noise, it's better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that these voters have chosen their own passengers - I do not know who, I have not been asked, but they have certainly chosen from the studio recordings made in total silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from that of the bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for a couple of decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops to remember, so I don't need this report, but foreigners who don't identify themselves in Brno and for which these reports are intended above all, can be confused and can be at the end of where they failed to understand, then say that the stop they were supposed to come to was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of speakers - but better speakers again - should be made again, and this time colored with normal transport noise and engine calculation, in which the cockpit of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
In order not to continue to listen to the name of the water station Hershpice, Šmirova, or then Ponorna in the clumping country to which I moved in Komárova.
I suppose my old ear didn't get worse all of a sudden during the one day when the speaker changed the arrest.
I understood that statement quite well the other day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the tape recorders.
Today, few people know what the greatest and most intelligent governments of all have been called complex checks.
I let myself remember that.
The bus was late.
I ran into the dispatcher's office at a time when the radio sounded like it was seven hours ago.
"You're lucky you didn't fight with your fellow chief, came a minute before you, and it seems like he's not in the mood," the dispatcher noted, while I was writing in the book of incomes.
Thank you, I'll give it to you.
Write me that I'm going to check out a little mechanics.
It's not gonna work out, it's a check today.
They're all out of shit until they're scared.
What's this about?
"But you'll see," said the dispatcher.
You'll be next.
I ran for a walk.
Then the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Stirred, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling corner.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I greeted him politely and quickly turned on two buttons of the same suit.
"Good morning," the answer sounded, and I quickly ran to the second floor, without realizing the cold, vicious tone that the old one responded to.
"You're playing," I was greeted by the engineer Eva, the elderly lady I really appreciated.
She was even the chief before her companions sat down.
There's checks, and you're gonna get there.
How many times have I wondered what the complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about them.
They're gonna be there once in three years, they all have to be there, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
But I'll see.
I pulled out a file from the column with periodic reports and then the phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me now," the chief's voice called out.
What's bothering you?
Now we met and nothing... "I missed, but no one answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
"Good day, my fellow chief, I came to your command," I reported, I entered the principal's office.
The chief was sitting behind the writing table and looking at some closet.
"A fellow mechanic," he said after a while without raising his head and still carefully looking at the ladder, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the ladder at the table, pushed himself into the chair, and hoisted at me with a usual, unpleasant, evil, puzzling look.
I've lost it.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the mayor commended me for having worked very well in those few months and for being very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the van at the distance.
And now this?
They realize that you're a track distance technique and that's why you have to behave.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I hesitated to use this kind of greeting from my childhood that I was so raised and that I didn't see anything wrong with it.
It was like a red hat on a croc.
"You're on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is an honor to work," said the commanding officer.
Besides, you're still messing with the seniors.
One time you'll say, "Lord" and the other time, "Judge."
But I'm not a gentleman for you, but a fellow chief.
Employers are co-workers, top coaches are co-workers!
Remember that kindly!
I'm sorry, sir... I'm with the chief, but... but I've greeted you with the usual civil greetings.
There's nothing wrong with it... and it's an honor to work, or to have a partner... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the side," said the chief, who in the meantime calmed down a bit.
But it's still going to happen.
Anyway, remember, you don't have the chair on top of your salary.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his advantage, it didn't look good with him.
For a while, I was stabbed by a cold, dirty look, and I was looking for the words that I would answer.
I'm not sure what he's up to.
He was only a few years older and he was playing the god, actually a fellow god.
A professional, sloppy, authoritarian, arrogant, how he felt at the moment.
He's been pulled out by everyone.
Wake up, he's the chief.
Actually, not everyone, the president of the party organization, like all the parties, but also non-citizens, tweeted.
But the chief beat many, especially those with whom he could apply his superiority.
Right now, he hit me for the whole shit.
I've been thinking about shit and I've had enough push to keep it out of his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the mall on Wednesday, so I could keep on doing the train station.
What would I use two kids for?
And that's an arranged bar!
I was in trouble, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all, you can go," the chief finished the audition and began to look literally again at the ladder he had in his hand before.
They called me in the middle of the 12th.
Everyone in the office was there already, asking questions what and how, they answered that it would be good.
Only Jojin was curious about how his habit was that we could not all go out because the work would have to be done by a fellow chief with his own faithful ones, and that it would not be dangerous.
The word "judgment" then emphasized it as if he knew what the old man was up to me for this morning.
There was a nice meeting in the principal's office.
The Society of Chiefs behind their writing table and at the long advisory table of other associates who were to decide on my office or not.
Kádrávák, President ROH, personal recorder, special-purpose rapporteur, something in a way contrary to the war, and the place, my boss.
And also the most important person, the president of the party organization.
I knew him from the strike.
The usual track worker, he slammed the dust or he saw the cast iron.
But also an ex-boyfriend.
It was heard that once in a while there was no funny, beautiful beast.
The bad languages said the school went out in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't have anything.
And when the criminal was canceled, he ended up at the end of the potatoes.
But, mate, that's right, that's what it was!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little baby in my neck, an unscrupulous scarf.
Kádrávák has read a review from the Civilian Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
So far it's good, I've thought about it, and I've already had a little better breath.
Then we'll review the party's organization.
He copied a review from the civil committee, and they both wrote the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of the long-term members of the parties refused to submit themselves before the inspection committee and subsequently came out of the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me very closely.
The cabman noticed and stopped reading.
The chief said he should continue.
It was worse still.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and there I was acquired as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party trusted me.
But I married and married, except for the National Committee, I also had a church.
I've disappointed the trust of the party in the worst way.
That's why I was expelled from the ranks of her candidates.
But it didn't!
I let both children get baptized, and even my mother, when she died, made a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
I'm giving all of this a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadre was read, only the punching of the chief's belt into the tableboard interrupted the busy silence.
Everyone looked at me, and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
At that time, I kept repeating in my mind, "Communists - Naked, Communists - Naked." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the caravans?
I could've fixed the escape without a fucking check.
But now?
The career of the railway officer took her place before she started.
Go back to the barn?
I don't think that's gonna work out, but I'm sure the chief's gonna be out for an hour.
"Counsel, how did you check out the discussed fellow here?" interrupted the silent chief with a question on the chair.
Well, according to a previous employment decision.
Do you have him here?
It's obviously not too late for the cadre.
At the back of the pit, he was nervously obliterating, as if he was being checked himself.
He hung a paper and handed it to the chief.
"Well," said the chief with a sign of greed, which often was the premonition of storms.
At first glance, he studied industry, worked in the task mill as a waiter, met the standard on an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
It's just a matter of fact.
From where did you take that judgment, mate?" he turned back to the cadre who felt that it was beginning to turn against him and that he might not even be a cadre soon.
This is where my partner gave it to me when she left.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the corner of the hall," bliquette said.
And there's no warrants, he was kind of extra, so I gave him a file.
"So, when you entered the technical function, you had enough of this paper," the chief said.
He was nervous and had no answer.
"Don't worry, we'll talk about it later," the chief closed the matter and the cadre obviously fell off.
For the time being, he's been setting it up.
"So what about you, mate?" the chief turned to me again.
I'm out of here all of a sudden, so it's over!
In my eyes, it's dark, it's hot.
He followed the course of confession and accusations, and I knew that I was the most resistant creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest pity.
That by stressing the incomplete judgment I mentioned in the error of the Cadet Rapporteur's companion, and I didn't understand why the judgment was incomplete when I received it from the Cadet at the factory.
I am also an antisocialist living, which, at the time of the construction of real socialism, supports the ranks of religious darkness, ba, even participating in them.
That there was a lot of that I did, or maybe I was still asleep, and I was praying for peace to end it.
I don't care.
I don't care if I get out of the machine room.
I don't care if they take my potato too.
It's a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemies of the people I was in the eyes of the chief's associate.
"So it would suffice, comrade of the chief," the president of the party suddenly called and interrupted the chief of the Levites.
This is where the associate made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he just did the stupid thing!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, my fellow chief!
What could be worse for a young man than we shut his door to the side for a while!
To open up again, he'll have to prove that he's changed that it's an hour of our trust.
An untrained barrister spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is that how he's read out, or did he break a phrase from party schools and a meeting?
That is why this young companion must also be given a chance from us!
The chance to prove he's changed.
And who's supposed to give it to him if it's not you, Chief's associate?
It's your duty to support this young, right, a bit of a beloved companion in his efforts to repair!
It's your side duty that no one's gonna get you out of here!
Actually, it's a side duty for all of us, too.
This is where the partner has to see that the party hasn't forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, not only does she punish, but she also loves her mother.
When the president's finished, no one even leaned.
No one's been waiting for that kind of turn.
At least me.
"Just as I agree with you, my colleague, the president," the chief tried to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me make a deal, you'd have heard that I was heading to that conclusion.
All agreedly, but they saw that they did not believe his word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a self-certification referent on basic funds," I rushed back to the office and broke down.
Besides the Evy engineers, they were all at lunch.
The silences listened to my independent perception of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked me if I could get a coffee.
Without waiting for the answer, she put water on the cooker and caught the caterpillars.
In the meantime, she talked about the cadron practices.
Like one judgment, often full of praise, they give the person into their hands, and the other, in which there is dirt, will send a new employee.
But I didn't end up where I was, but at the end of the day, at the potatoes, and so the company didn't know where they were supposed to send it.
What about our cab?
He's just getting old where he'd eat or drink, and then he finally got the way he did.
"That's from the old secret," she said, "unfortunately.
I'm sure he won't taste it today.
Just take care of him, he's pretty guilty.
And the party president?
Basically a much worse chief, no crowd.
Zero from a potato with a lot of power.
The water for the coffee started to boil, and the office filled the pot with fresh coffee.
I put sugar in a cane, and the cane mixed a hot leukaemia.
I hope I'm out of the worst.
Now it's not gonna work out for me, and the other checks are only in three years.
Anyway, I don't think I'm gonna forget about that today.
Anthology of LITERATIA on TRATI II in the EPIKA loader
The symbol of the alien has survived.
The windmill around Chlum is running again after years.
It's visible far away because it's located at 15 meters high.
People from a wide area call him "the wind on the Chlum."
For the population of 150, it became even one of the elements of the general mark, which the population gained the opportunity to meet the parents in 2010.
"We then asked for a sign and the wind on the sign of course we wanted to have, of course, everyone knows it," said Mayor Jiři Mašek.
The Chlumsian wind pump is a local technical memory.
It is also a little of the present: it reminds us of the time when the present people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past century was rare.
By 1910, the hummingbirds had decided to decide a solution, which then lasted until the mid - 1980s.
In the village at the bay of Chichov, they let out a seven - foot [7 m] deep well.
Three years later, the cold was added to the metal structure with a wind pump, which poured water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village near the right church.
"The construction has been carried out by Antonín Kunc of Hranic on Moravia with 2,400 crowns," notes the memorial on the ground floor of the construction of the yard.
After a few repairs and windmills, it served in 1971.
Then, on May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the water struggle began to be written: that day, in Chlumu, a new stream began to be used.
The wind pump has already remained only a non-functional general symbol and the current rarity.
The Dominant was promoted at the birth this year.
By 2008, Chlumšti decided that the wind cycle would be restored and reinstated.
They left to produce a replica of the original wheel - reduced average by half a meter.
The bike was hit by the coach, but it had to be pulled down that year.
The producer of the replica did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel should not spark the wind currents.
After that, the Chlumsian ruler had been resting under the roof for several years.
Since June, however, the wheel on the high ladder has been running again.
On the occasion of the birth of the twins, the twins left the replica of the wheels to be adjusted and again seated on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel is pumping useful water from the cold only to the left-wing blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely unplugged him because there was little water in the barn.
At least it was empty.
"In the afternoon, the windmill from the pump in the bag will be unplugged again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind cycle into the general sign, however, is the only one of these species all over the Highland.
They have a similar element in the mark to honor local technical memories, for example in Chvalkovich and Green Mountain in Viškovsk, in Kuželová in Hodoninsk, Partutovich in Prerovsk or in Police in Vsetinsk.
Nothing bad, but Lafata didn't know, she admitted the opposition to Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the battle against Slavia very well, and my goal, like all in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-suppress press conference.
This time, George Hagi trained us, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I'm going to hit Sparta right now.
Only with the difference that we don't lose this time," Goian continued.
Just this man, who was posing 60 fights for Romanian representation, is a key resistance to the Greek team.
As a stopper, he'll face the attacks of the Spartan offensive.
There will be a few thousand people, no hell, says about the Greek battle, Captain Hybsh.
And he partly knows what can wait for him Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in Romania's Astro with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their fights back then.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta, too, said Goian.
The other footballers of the Prague club didn't mention, so the direct question came, whether David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and looked at the Czech press with a slight calculation view.
The unbearable expression in the face was, "Why are you asking me this?"
After a while, you let it go.
We saw some videos, and I noticed Sparta playing a lot of teams.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
Nothing bad, but I don't know anybody else but Fatia.
The expert on Goian knows very well.
"My experience with larger clubs, it can be said that they hold the defense of Asteras, it's such their game organizer," said Stanislav Haykal, a spartan assistant.
Goian has had the best years of his life, but he can boast of a very interesting football biography.
In time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, was interested in him, both the United and the City Manchester, but Steauy headed for the Italian Palermo, playing for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a large team, regularly playing European Cups, beads about the victory in the Czech League.
For me, it's a favorite fight, but we're playing at home and we want to start the group with a good outcome.
Like Sparta, we're gonna try to win, Goian said.
I'm in peace with the Slovenian barrister Tomáš Košicki, who is very pleased with the competition from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new seat should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading with company shares at the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group seat in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken in the context of the project are mostly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on action in the company, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In relation to the move of the group, shareholders consider the placement of shares at the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes the prospectus of the securities, which will be presented at the earliest possible time by the Czech National Bank for approval.
The transfer of holding positions and related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction by involving only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no public registration or new investors will be offered in the context of this operation.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would be made - the company will withdraw and its shareholders will decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares at a stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares at a stock exchange.
Test of objectivity of Czech television in information on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the reports of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time, the main news broadcast of Czech television.
How'd it go?
When journalists are taught at the faculty about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's Czech TV Event.
The migration crisis has been devoted to about 80% of the reporting.
Until the first minute, when CT informed of the concerns at the Serbian-Madjerian border and the attacks of migrants on the police, euphemisticically called them patience - thrown stones and attacked by metal sticks), the current promulgating propaganda - is already running - consider the names of the individual reports itself.
The criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the poor treatment of migrants.
Syrian Children in the Czech School - story of the integrated Syrian people in the Czech Republic.
They're not only a threat, they're a chance.
Traveling of refugees - ČT consistently uses expressions of runner or fugitive rather than migrants.
In particular, the CT uses only images for small children and women in illustration.
In the same broadcast, however, it stated that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that does not have a period of communist agitants.
I have to say I'm ashamed of my colleagues as a former journalist.
Ecology in practice.
When I first got into a panel apartment, I was soon to stop being the only resident.
I was moved by fish at a boarding school.
Fish domestic, wet with a change of incomplete, i.e., non-performing it transfer from the mussel to brooch and young looks like an adult, it's just tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't want to lose them.
First handy and then chemical.
Socialist drugs on their disposal provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But it was successfully eliminated.
Later, I dealt with the Pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with some juvenalizer that the ants brought into the nest, and then he did not allow the queen to produce a new offspring.
But I turned it down.
As time went on, he also became a wet subject of my admiration, and I became more and more attached to the view that they have the same right to life as we do.
In addition, I've learned from my life that infecting the ecosystem does not lead to success and one damage can replace another.
The truth of the blokes and the dogs, I'd probably not get rid of their food by killing them.
In our new home, we agreed with our partner that if we don't have the fish lying behind our neck, we'll have the wolves eat the lost skin in peace, some of the invisibilitys and so on.
Their peaceful existence has been disrupted by spiders.
It was a common type of lodger who lived on the roof for a long time.
We thought he was living with occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only gave us comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we learned that he was living mainly with fish and that he was probably keeping their numbers in a profitable way.
With reliable regular contact, we have found that she is a female when needed.
We were witnesses of romantic offenses with a partner about a third less than he was careful about the spider's fibers, so he wouldn't be eaten before he reached the exhausted couplings.
It took about three days for them not to move and not to respond to our controls.
Under the toilet, where loving toys were played, we later found the remains of the dried female by the females.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was already behind us, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They're gone soon.
For the sake of their mother, for the sake of their children, for the sake of others.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she left or fell asleep, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the roof again.
The truth is, about something smaller, it's probably the daughter of those toilets.
For some time, she carefully observed our behavior, and by moving under the western month, she assessed our non-attack as friendship.
The numbering status of fish caught was reduced again, and spiders quietly looked at their normal activities to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year round.
Our daughter grew up among them when the use of the nightstand was a shame.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've already been fed by the eternal elimination of its contents.
We urged her to use the toilet even more.
However, the daughter found an excuse in the spider that she saw very well in her swallowing.
Our talk about the spider seeing, happiness in the house didn't even take place.
With tears and tears, she made up her nightlife.
There wasn't any leftovers.
There was a time when spiders had to report to the daughter's developmental shift.
It was on me.
He was taken to a glass and shown across the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I've been messing with him like a friend, but after as long as I've been with him, I've felt as ugly as if I'd throw away my relative.
We assumed that fishermen would start to appear more often and would start to multiply in a geometric order.
The world's strange, the week, the two, we haven't found out.
I started speculating about the reason.
It seemed to me that if the spider had not grown up there in the pattern of ants, the environment of the toilet wasn't as favourable for their existence as we thought it would be.
But then the first pieces of the middle size appeared, and they're already moving again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their bond to the spider had to have a reason for not seeing him, that he was hidden somewhere else, and that they were threatened from anywhere.
Or, perhaps, they had some telepathic connection with their predator and his rapid disappearance caused some frightening reaction.
You're saying that I'm not making any illusions about their appearance.
They showed some kind of a flashlight, but they would react to hand-to-hand or quick movement, no.
The daughter's going to the bathroom all the time.
I think she's forgotten about the night.
There's only one spider left.
I'm already sending my wishes to the ether and I hope they didn't hurt me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that Cyclone B.
The waste of Albert Einstein's sentences, which enriched the world.
The years of the genius scientist of the past century are likely to never cease to fascinate mankind.
He managed to sink into everything so deep that the outcome was always amazing.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
People have come to the knowledge of their special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic state.
It is also not possible to mention its explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of quantifiing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very description and the system of knowledge of popular relativity theory is for many to the contrary that for a closer acquaintance, they prefer easy settings.
It's not easy, though.
Of course, it would not be Albert Einstein if he did not find this in a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: an hour close to your lover seems to be a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems to be an hour - and that is relative.
I've allowed myself from his entire sheet of famous quotes to choose these ten that have literally caught me.
Smart people are trying to solve problems, brilliantly trying not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about that first one.
No amount of effort can ever prove that I was right.
The only one who can prove that I was wrong at any time.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break up atoms than to destroy predestinations.
Is the mess on the table reflecting the mess in mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's going to fight in World War Three, but in that fourth, it's gonna be clacks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but none to resurrect it.
Knowing a little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem that would depend on my life, I'd spend 40 minutes of his study, 15 minutes of his analysis and 5 minutes of his solution.
In the world the hardest thing to understand income tax.
Finally, I can't forgive Einstein's formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, the pattern is: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is holding the language for teeth.
New and modern.
The hospitals in Zlinsk are waiting for 1.5 billion changes.
"It is a success when we consider that all four are kept in black numbers all this year," said happy Heitman Stanislav Mishák.
At the moment, the total profit of the country's facilities is about 32 million crowns.
The share of this is mainly higher than insurance, which is equally favourable for this year.
And this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally allow more investment.
In Croméríží, Vsetín, Uherský Gradště and Zlíní, this is why it is intended to build buildings that will total nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
The long time we bought the main equipment ended.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, the peak health is not possible, the plans for the local health centre Lubomír Nezem.
She's looking forward to the changes in all the hospitals.
The construction workers will come to the hospital next year.
In Ossetian, the suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now selecting nearly 300 million crowns.
They have a planned dialysis port in the Crossroads.
The Uher Garden wants to set up a new home for the opened central pavilion of about 200 million this year.
And the Zlinska Batá's hospital is looking forward to a long-awaited construction of a new central income and internal, which will need three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is a fundamental and often biggest change in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said for example, for example, the construction of the Svettinian Internal Director of the Věra Prouskova Hospital.
Five-foot building should be ready for about two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal and neurological, dialysis, new ambulances, bed and intensive care.
More comfort for patients.
Changes, which are particularly familiar to patients, will affect all regions.
New buildings, for example, replace those in which many sick people are located in one room, have only one toilet on the floor, beds are non-replaceable, windows are not closed, and doctors do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our interior was built 15 years ago and is now on the edge of its life," said the director of Pavel Calábek's home hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building linked to an emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, in addition to in new spaces.
The same model already has half of the ready Uher Garden.
The central income is already standing, and he's going to be inside for three years.
"We will pay the building from the loan and partly from our own resources," explained Director Petr Słádek.
This hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profit is still high, and it did not reach a loss two years ago, when an evil hospital had to deal with almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, revenue and cost management across the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdák, who has an economy of care, said.
Improvements are also expected in patients in a cross-border hospital.
Over the next ten to fifteen years, it will go to repair, new tools and reconstructions up to half a billion crowns.
Already this year, the emergency station will be ready to repair, then the dialysis station will begin, if necessary, construction of the building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one told me how to keep accepted refugees in the country if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec (CSSD) complains to his European colleagues that the other countries of the Czech Republic are pushing to accept quotas for the redeployment of refugees, but refuse any discussion.
It also suggests that no one has ever explained to him how to keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position that you have reached in the process of dealing with ministers inside and abroad of the European Union?
We don't agree with mandatory quotas like a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants like small salt or flour.
They're living beings who have some vision, some direction, some relative.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we could keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were to redistribution.
We can't imagine.
We did not get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with this.
We've been talking about this for a year and we've been saying this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We've solved 40 thousand recently, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people in this area?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who cross over us want to go to Germany.
Nearly no one wants us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have ambitions to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, get asylum with us, but the interest of people from this migratory wave, that is, Syria and other countries, is only near zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't even want to come to us, but fifteen people have already made a commitment.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept them this way more?
We made a commitment to accept 1500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even in the 1500s, there will be 1,100 people with whom we deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we've caught them.
It is a big question, and we will discuss it with Europe if we can hold back people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, where appropriate in Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
That means they'll come to our territory with registration, and if there's an agreement that's not yet, it can happen that we won't even hold those 1100 in the Czech Republic and they'll go back to Germany when they get there.
If we are able to keep them under asylum proceedings, we will arrange an asylum procedure with them.
Should the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 per cent of European statistics provide international protection.
Then they will get the documents that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will relocate.
This is the second project that is currently taking place, and there we have only advanced in that we are discussing with the churches the possibility that they might be able to help them find employment, housing and so on.
But it's a very long run.
You said that the other states were not willing to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But is it not that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but does it offer no solidarity step that would block the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is going to be?
If the Spolk Republic of Germany urges all migrants from Syria to be able to do so, the report will spread in an hourly manner throughout all camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's another migration wave that leads to Germany, because they just don't want us.
We believe that the road is to protect the external borders - simply to deal with the migration waves, to help the necessary ones, and to divide economic migrants.
One way to let them know they don't have a chance.
Only a year ago, 50 thousand Kosovos arrived in Germany.
From secure Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state representations.
If we managed to separate them and do not accept them or accept them only as economic needs, then the 50 percent of what today's social systems are spending on them could go to refugees.
In contrast to the first day when Germany took control, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
Where does it come from to further strengthen border controls?
We were afraid of being caught in a row of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred free seats in stone arrest facilities.
Of course, all the people we're holding will be returning to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it by default.
They are the only people who take us, it's complicated with Hungary and the Greeks - it's a completely unnecessary story.
So where's the point of a break?
Should it be a thousand a day?
I think it's supposed to be a couple hundred days a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days a day, we're running out of capacity, so that crisis plans come in.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would call the extraordinary government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're on the phone several times a day.
If this is the situation, the government can sit down de facto immediately and decide by one resolution to strengthen the police force on the army, let's give that customs administration, if any, on the prison service.
The country's variant is an exceptional position that has now been issued by Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can go that far.
Be aware that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have a Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what should happen to this happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread horrendous information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, is more likely to suggest that the Hungarians will try to remove the migration flows to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would touch it very borderlinely, almost at all.
Slavia has paid a lot of debts for the last minute.
It's trying to prevent the declaration of failure.
Soccer Slavia paid off debts.
The footballers were also waiting for their money.
Soccer Slavia stayed on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after about 20 million crowns gave her the proposal of Online Services from Pacific Samoa.
The legal representative of Slavia Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzlov for several hours that he was not supposed to report an accident on Slavia.
And it has to be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group of CEFC and the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimana.
Obviously, from the new owners to the club, they've been making money for the last time.
This also proves the statement of the celebration before Tuesday's trial - the Supreme Club on Monday, only the day before the trial at the court, sent tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was awarded between September 11th and September 15th," the legal representative of Slavia Mládková said.
To whom did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and trading partners.
For example, the Slovenian ex-representant Milan Ivan or the Czech Deputy Chief of Staff, Mariu Lick.
Slavia also paid agent Alexandr Losenicke a fee.
Already on Friday, the club also paid the debt fees of the city of Prague 10.
Part of the insolvency dispute thus remains de facto only claims that Slavia disputes.
According to the club, the commitments were not made at all, or they were dealt with in court.
However, we are prepared to pay for the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can provide with a statement from the account," lawyer Mládková told the judge.
"All that was due is paid," Mádkova declared and added that the undeserved are only unpaid or disbursed commitments.
It is also true that the judge will not decide in the next few days, and the trial will continue.
She gave Slavii three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid the debts.
Next comes a review of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of proceedings on November 3rd.
However, the decision will not come to this meeting, but in writing after it.

FastMig X is the latest generation of inverter coating sources.
The combination of peak technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular design brings benefits and rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
And anything, from the heating of the construction steel after the heating of the special alloys, as well as from the heating of the rough materials after the heating of the thin plates, from the application in the workshops to the heating of the refrigeration in the refrigerators.
The incredible amount of shrinking curves, simple adjustment and expansion of the shrinking source enables a rapid response to change requirements, leading to a reduction of the simples, to the need to stop the source and to a more productive shrinking.
FastMig X enables the heating of peak heating processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality heating.
It stops wasting time and does not allow for material flooding or correction of wrong weights.
It is provided with flexibility, is less simple, more heating and higher profit.
It's this year's news she had a premiere in Nitra, where she also won gold medals.
We appreciate this approach because it confirms the product's exceptionalness.
The world's leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but due to the differences in software and parameters, FastMig X belongs to the world tip.
For the interested parties, the additional periods are also pleasant, which are moving around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already made the first contacts that will continue to expand after the Brno Fair.
We have been his regular participants for more than 20 years, and almost always our commercial results are better than before, highlights the company ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, the leading salesman of Kemppi in Plzno.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
It went to build a blank so it wouldn't fail.
But it would be half a billion more, says an expert from the company who designed the tunnel.
Blank was even safer, says the expert.
The Blanka Tunnel complex was possible to build so that there were no two land failures in the Prague Stromovce, the factory director of Satra, who is the main projector of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday afternoon at a news tour of the tunnel.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was going to hit safer, but the costs are rising exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovce were the same all the time, although the country was only a few steps away from where it began to develop a safer and more cautious approach.
"If these measures were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion miles away," Butovic said.
Blanke tunnel failed three times during the building.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovce, in 2010 the land fell into the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is too expensive, said the Euro Week.
According to the original intention, the building had 17 billion crowns.
When we add the VAT that went out twice during the construction period, you have eleven billion.
When technology, land purchases and engineering, valuation and similar items are added to this, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from those 37 again to so far, says Bélohlav
Someone ordered that and paid for it.

Zisky FedExu mixed, reduced fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfied results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of annual profits due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers on holidays.
The company’s share decreased by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before the mid-market opening.
FedEx says it expects a profit between $10,40 and $10,90 for fiscal year, which ends next May, which means a 20 cent reduction from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey carried out by FactSet.
The reduced view comes despite an average increase in interest rates of 4.9 per cent, which appears in January. 4, and higher supplements for the land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it was still expected to increase its profit against the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The Chair and CEO of Fred Smith said that the company "prepared a firm performance despite the expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday rental plans were announced the day after the rival UPS stated that the plan has to hire 90,000 to 95,000 employees, which is probably the same as last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The share profit was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for the share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned Zacks Investment Research.
Markets increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decrease in priority international shipping, causing revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But boom in online shopping increased the results of the FedEx Earth Unit.
In the last quarter, land income increased by 29 per cent, but operating profit was essentially the same for higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while profit decreased in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-trade, about an hour before the opening of the FedEx share fell by $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under the June 11 record.
At its most unexpected meeting over the years, the Federal Reserve Lawyer spends two days this week at 27 feet of the long Hong Kong table and will decide whether it is time to increase the key interest rate after almost ten years.
As they are one end of the Ornament of the Central Bank, the two-storey sitting room will be painted by the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are going to give the economic interests of the people over everything else.
The central bank has a double bid from Congress: to maximize American employment and keep the present prices stable.
But since the Great Depression, the Fed representatives have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third functional period: financial stability.
And this third functional period could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced Thursday, whether the American economy is ready to set off from the unprecedented incentive in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
Although most data show strong economic growth, recent turbulence on world financial markets could already scare the cautious Fed by adding to the instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - and that is nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour and inflation market will first be the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that they were just looking for a delay in not increasing the level, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient reasons to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed will do, which is the cause of the nervousness in financial markets.
About half of the economies recently questioned by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to hold back, with the key indicator only about 30% chance of increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market in the event that the Fed increases the rates, only if the policy makes a drastic failure by pledge that the further increase is inconceivable.
In Tuesday's industrial average, Dow Jones jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599,85.
The meeting was triggered by the expectation that the Fed policy will hold back the rates this week, says John Lonski, the main economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise the rates now," he says.
If Fed had done so, "they would have to go to the limit in their programme statement and hold the financial markets in their hands so that they would not lose the panic."
Other experts claimed that the increase in interest rates would calm down the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would act.
Only a month ago, it seemed that Fed was on a good path to an increase of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in slow strengthening the currency conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the United States.
Yellen said over the spring and early years, he expected an increase in interest rates this year and through the complaints from the liberals that there is a need for more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the labour market has seen strong growth this year.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, which is lower in more than seven years and is close to the level that Fed considers to be full employment.
The wage profits showed the signs of the rise.
And even though inflation continues to be under the 2% target of the central bank, Fed says that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
Economics "can be balanced with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets all over the world began to decline at the end of last month, after China was wasting its money.
The industrial average of Dow Jones decreased by 16% under its record value in May when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market was somewhat reflected this month, and Dow is now losing only about 10% of the maximum of May.
To the political factors of the Fed, the restless situation on the market adds a complex calculation when it starts to increase the interest rate.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and reports on the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a strengthening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a research worker at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now, they predict that they will wait at least a month to get better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about how this will affect the US economy, and there are almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in their decision-making.
But in fact, Fed became the currency authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The strong sign of the then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "taste" their monetary expansion on the market, has launched leaps all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interlinked, it can be expected that representatives of the Fed are monitoring developments elsewhere, but also working with other central bankers and experts so that they can better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the wealth management of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "The Fed has a history of movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Markets Committee's policymaking, which pressed for an increase in interest rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions "I despite limited identification effects on growth in the USA," said Lacker.
About a year later, Fed's representatives turned these scissors.
The Fed should give priority to concerns about financial stability only during the major crisis, such as the market collapse in 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's interest-setting committee.
The latest call is not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of interest growth because the markets have dissolved," said Posen, president of the Peterson International Economy Institute.
The Federal Reserve System Act still has two mandates and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the point.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinese Quarter
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells for the public.
Yeah, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/store is the only contact place offering an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian decorations, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
Even car parts are available if you need some motor oil.
Trade is massive, and it'll take you an hour to get through all the streets.
If you are hungry for all of this, go to the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading station (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has different pick-up locations.
What on stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and many items are sold in large sizes.
Among fresh products are special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and others.
Mass enlargement is great, for example, fish - employees behind the desk wash you and make you even smell it, if you want it,
The good part of the store is left to a massive freezing section where you will find frozen peels of leaves, bitter melon and gallangal, whole ducks, fish, beef and veal, pork beans, fish balls, regional sausages, free-selling semi-trailers and others.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
The broad streets come up with shopping vehicles and high-speed vehicles.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the treasure stand.
Where it is located: Trade is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounds the suburbs of the Chinese quarter and center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space, which shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be busy, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the roads will stay with the old one.
The acceleration to 150 km/h of Snowfall has been refused.
On selected sections of the roads it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed by 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, she decided to join the amendment of the Senate, which refused to increase the speed.
The new land communications law will now turn to the president.
At the end of April, President Milos Zeman said he would veto the law that would allow a foot-and-mouth speed.
Against the increase, the Minister of Transport Dan Çok (for the UN), according to which the Czech road network has not yet been built at such a speed.
Even on Tuesday before the MP, he supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved new ones will now be able, in accordance with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first class roads, in particular four-way roads.
The camera first extended this option even on the road to which it would be possible to drive at the chosen speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
The envoys have now joined in on his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport from the novel, also insisted that the transport police have the last word to amend the local communications they are taking care of.
The Senate version approved by Sniemovna is also calculated to allow the sewerage, plumbing or public lighting cables to be stored separately below the surface of the carriages.
That's how the aliens would save the land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
Novela is also intended to help improve road safety and facilitate the loading of the villages with the vehicles to which the owner does not report.
The new municipalities could sell detachable vehicles which are not submitted within a six-month period following notification of the detachment of their owners.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit cargo transport across their territories by the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of torture and for shipping companies.
The novel also disrupts the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of today's papers, which will be used even after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The oral expressionator goes before the court.
For the predestined welcome of the mayor, he's been threatened for 10 years.
The case relates to the allegedly previewed welcome project.
The police wanted to reach this case, and the Ambassador Zuzan Kailov (CSSD), the Ambassador of the House, did not issue it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both are at risk for up to ten years.
The main count is already planned for two October days.
According to state representative Mandík and Macík, at least one million crowns have caused damage, resulting from the complaint.
The complaint is based on a knowledgeable judgment.
The former city management, according to the plaintiff's title, unduly allowed the property of the company which organised the welcome of the citizens.
Mandík has, according to his complaint to the head of the then magistrateial committee of urban services, education and culture, invested in the election of five affiliated companies.
When another company, which offered the lowest price, applied to the competition, the board canceled the competition.
The contract was then to entrust the city to the administrator and only Darothore was registered to the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges were directed to ensure for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organisation of the events The welcome of the municipalities in Ústí nad Labem for a long time and coordinated at least in breach of the requirement to treat the proper economy, writes the state representative.
At the same time, he was aware that Darothore subsequently, following the acquisition of this contract, Ústí nad Labem is counting on the implementation of the welcome price measures, which will, in contrast to the real value of the services actually provided, be disproportionately elevated.
In three years, the company was charged with more than five million crowns, according to the draft.
Finally, the city paid only one piece, about 1.7 million crowns, and then came down from the contract.
The amount paid was estimated to have been at least one million crowns pre-favoured.
Mandík has already refused any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this built-in case, the former prime minister said before that the city under his leadership was just tying to a similar project from last years.
From 2008 to 2010 the event was provided by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, the same money," Mandík added.
The criminals wanted to accuse also Ambassador Kailov, who was also a member of the city council.
But she didn't give it up to get caught.
Therefore, in her case, the criminals have deferred the charges, but they count on Kaill's charge after the deputy's mandate is over.
The welcome of the citizens was a social action that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian policemen allegedly left the dog on the run.
Then the reporters were forced to delete the record.
The Hungarian police were on the border with Serbia shortly detained the cameraman of the AP and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog allegedly hit the refugee country.
The Hungarian government, however, doubts this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday night when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia across the corn field near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Against the refugees, the police stepped forward and one of them let an Syrian attack a dog with a basket on a hook.
The dog of a man who shouted, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," broke down, claimed Muzi.
The fact that Muzi is filming everything, he noticed one of the cops and he wouldn't let him leave.
Then the reporter shouldn't have called his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The Muzi police took him to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had been fed.
Then he was ordered to delete the record.
Muzi thus found the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt threatened because they were near dogs.
The AP has sent a protest letter to the Hungarian government of Zoltán Kovács.
The conduct of police officers in it was unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not afraid that the government would destroy the legal material obtained.
Kovács, with a call to the Museum's police report, questioned the events.
He said the police just wanted a reporter to show them if they were on some footage they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't push him.
"The dogs can puke - they are trained to scare off and push a little bit of fear, but they certainly didn't attack," Kovács says.
Unpredictable League of Masters.
Victory to the City will pick us up, believes Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," cut the head of Manuel Pellegrini, the visitor of the home city.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the League of Masters.
Not one team has created a lot of opportunities, but we had a ball on the treadmills for a long time.
"The reason for the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful bullets," assessed the Pellegrini strike, whose team incassed in the competition race after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the last Juventus season at that time was exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league has what is covered by the title only point and the score 2:4 is up to the 16th place of the table.
And that's why the turn to Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This victory will help us mentally, it will kill us," believes Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidala.
In Manchester, they represented Pogba, Mangjukic and Morat.
"That's right, this victory is very important, so that we can find it on the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best men in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
This result is what my players deserve.
"Before our balancing goal, we could have incassed at 0:2, but Gianluigi supported us," praised the viewer Allegri Golman Buffon.
"We've burned several good odds," hated Yay Touro, Deputy City.
We need to get out of the League of Experience Masters and try a better outcome next time.
Good-bye, Angelo. Good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we continue to ask immigrants, we should realize that all the media shakes around are handled by professionals.
According to the need for the media and also the sessora.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children who carry on their parents ’ hands on dusty roads of the exodus.
And that calls for a person - that is, a European person - automatically to feel guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate children, notice on the pictures of docking ships to the Greek islands, that the baby isn't so visible on them!
Well, we've been missing recently from the TV images of the ships heading on Lampedus, refugees from the French border at Menton, with thousands of young men with beautiful walks.
Most of the young blacks.
And they also disappeared images from Callais, where these people eat, and black men are waiting to see if they can get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think it's gonna work anymore.
Neither did the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans make any special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
Too much of it ran out of falsehood.
So when it comes to escape quotas, it's kind of a secret that it's not only about unhappy children from Syria, but also about exposed - for older people: fashionably sophisticated - young men.
Their muscles look like they just got out of a fitness center.
It's just one personal experience.
This summer in the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we slept on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And out of them came a young black man.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all dressed in brand clothes and boots, in hand, like otherwise, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, it was not interesting and employees - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid of them.
They planted all the beds.
Whoever didn't lie on it and was just in the sea had a bad heart.
They were dressed like from an American rapper movie.
On the head of the hat with a nose, white and colorful adidas on the legs.
Then they took the local beach bar and started to breed.
They sat the chairs around, sat next to the breakfast and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children were showering from the dining room somewhere in peace.
The next blacks drank beer even from a third - how in the USA series?! - threw empty bottles around them on the beach.
They kept yelling loud at each other.
It wasn't English, of course.
Then they went to drink wine, even from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in the brand swimsuits, especially those young ladies - in the water barbers and screams, the mothers with children and refugees ran away fearfully and for half an hour no more on the beach or in the pool nor any black guest.
Everyone's gone.
No matter whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The nun said to me in a loud voice last night, "Have you seen the gold they had on them?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the clerk.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had a massive gold chain around their necks.
And one had on his neck about 20 centimeters of solid gold cross.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Is that a drug addict?" I asked.
"You've seen them booze," said the chalice.
The drugs don't eat, they don't even live.
You're wearing something else.
So it was clear to me what they were feeding.
However, in June 2105, it wasn't important to me yet.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
But secret services and top politicians should know that first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were released to Europe at that time.
And they went, and they went.
Today it has been shown that the main problem of the European Union is that total-political-correct policies, like intellectuals and their binding lobbyist and economically important groups have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its policies - today publicly recognised major forces in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, also EU and television spots, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are on the level of pictures of Moscow's television from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few solarists at the station, but mainly - the old-fashioned - Muslims welcomed their counterparts.
For many weeks, reports on Czech television have baffled, as if according to some research, the Germans are almost all for the arrival of immigrants.
But who was just a few days in Germany knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, a famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Republic of Poland.
According to the ARD claim, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs reported.
However, what happened the other day in Germany was hidden: the polling showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - 67,000 people were involved in the poll.
It is true that Merkel's office publicly in November 2010, that is, five years ago, declared: "Our effort on multi-cultural society has completely failed."
Then she said, "Germany gives up the fight for multicultural society."
"Every effort has been made to make such a combination completely wrong."
In a country where four million Muslims live, according to it, there was no strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live next to themselves without integration.
But it's not a reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say we're just living happily by ourselves, this approach failed.
He just moved.
But neither Merkel has the power to go against powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political justice.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rising rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD, the only one who in the Euro-parliament probably has no maturity - yes, that is what Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play the supervisor in the concentration from a minute to a minute ago - as he has already shown himself.
It seems, in particular, that Germany has crossed the Rubikon.
Note that, to some extent, most European policies do not support these judgments, citizens of the countries that have been victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have been trying, at least on the outside, to deal with their horrific past of the aggressor and the murder of millions?
Do they have the truth to say that in the soul of Germany there is a devil of aggression, superiority and violence?
Did the office of Otto von Bismarck have the truth when he stopped with all his strength the attempts of the Grand Duchy to control the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say that the great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When she was abandoned, she started preparing for World War I.
The idea of Velkonemek, which led Germany and Europe into two wars, which stood millions of lives, is likely to return in a different form.
After the Marxist attempt to rule the state, for example with the Red Army Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, on the basis of ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideas of Nazism, began to develop new German ideology.
We'd say solar.
German elites have for a long time defended the rise of German nationalism, and so left to peace all those fighters against the atom, zeal seeking paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who all over the world want to do something different and better, they fully leaned on the side of combatants against warming the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this stream there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slovenian current, all of which are all Slavs for a difficult verb - since the time of Karl Marx, who, according to the Jewish parents, was mainly German nationalist.
And also, as the recent judgments of Schulze and the German minorities show, openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of the German leader.
Which is necessary without apologizing.
Otherwise, you're upset!
And when we add that immigrants are a very influential group of fans, we have what we have.
And behind it is always capital, especially the German, which it is capable of, and which is because Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through banks and the Union.
The pseudovirus of sunflowers first led Germany to the bazaars of ecology and multiculturalism and brought them home today and will possibly bring millions of Muslims.
Those who, the blue-eyed voices of the siren, will soon come upon the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they'll start to wake up.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbours with force, once again part of its inhabitants - but as it seems, the smaller part - can be ideologically weakened, but ultimately it can be realized as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim accommodation is already burning.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists are broken?
They will be helped by Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time, but certainly never assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslim, Islamic, and Germans come into their midst, following the fear of Islamization of their country?
What will he do with Germany, and even with Germany, when people who will be loud and publicly protest against the new Euro-Old Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has led to the support of solar ideology in Europe, i.e. the ideologies of electorate and in principle totalitarian, and their unintended banks, is growing.
And because of the unfavourable attitude towards disobedient democratic Germans and all subsisting and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of greedy sellers: scare them to death.
It's enough to stick, and the toughest thing is to stick around you in a way that doesn't have to get any worse.
The reliving head will set you up and startle and stiff, on the way away will accompany (as it is started) the indispensable salesman and the lively sushi.
Maybe it's a shame that the speaker can't really fix the tape.
Even with us, there would be a lot of pussies and smudges.
Oxalis corniculata.
A small flower that tolerates the dry environment.
And that's how it's located between the outdoor lawns near my place.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to expansive flowers, but it creates a beautiful impression of the wheat.
It's between the outdoor lawns.
She's unquestionable, she's doing it in our garden.
She likes a dry environment, she's easily adaptable, humble and unsolicited.
They make leaves with chaotic composition, but that's why they're worth watching and taking pictures.
In short, there is only a beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompany.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes healthy diet while breast-feeding
Brazilian paediatric company SPRS came in a shocking way to try to mediate women's knowledge of the importance of good food by drawing images of children sitting from the breast painted with an image of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that deliver to the lungs all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the energy requirement, pregnant women and newborn mothers are recommended to increase daily caloric intake of 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should take.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic makeup of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that poor diets had a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nina's trying to take over management at Today's Show
According to Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry, due to the lack of liberal leadership, it was not possible to create a sufficient increase in evaluation for Today.
Nine's morning show from national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's hit by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise and host David Koche and Samantha Armytage met in London as part of a week long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
Aussie TV did not seem to care so much about this remote tyranny as it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 broadcasters today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was up to the last quarter (343,000).
Today, in the last few months, he's filling up a space on the Sunris.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today compared with 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was moving between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Wind changes affect more than Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for your help!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
A great report for Seven was an amazing debut of 800 words with a former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently inhabited father, who decides to move with his two children to the eastern part of New Zealand, has on average a very impressive 1,219 million spectators.
Critics wondered if Thomson would be able to shut down a TV hit without the rappers Rebecca Gibney star.
The result of last night is a clear yes.
The X Factor from Seven left strong 1,136 million spectators, and quickly defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed surveillance the other night The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new television show (from 17:00 to 17:30) that Andrew O'Keefe' had on average 446 000 viewers.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and a second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the drop in The Chase Australia from the second night, Nina will be convinced that the Hot Seat at 17:30 will finally win.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a million dollar minute series that couldn't beat McGuiru's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect kid - but who will choose?
A secret discovered?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezan Markoski may have been reluctant to find out who wins the Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to the Bachelor's house, she's covered with an inexhaustible secret.
And the three girls who stay are definitely not gonna tell you who the right one is to finally get the pink.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two, thankless told us who won.
Sam Wood's got a tongue for his teeth at the Thursday final.
All three women lyrically explained why Wood was a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, in the question, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could work as a coyle about who wins the hearts of Bachelor.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, the Markos were quick to name Mackay as the one who would be the best to go to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been sharing an easy relationship since one day.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed Sara and Sam's energy, I felt they were pretty compatible and I still think so during the course," Jeavons-Fellows says.
"Sarah is a truly earthly woman, she's very funny with her," said Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're good together, and they're happy.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could make a nice couple with Sam Wood.
For her own claim that during his last visit at home, she realized that Wood might be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was not just a game - I now opened my heart to him," he says.
I asked who Wood would choose, if it wasn't for her, to look mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls alike - it's between Sneezen and Lana indecisive.
Bachlor's on Wednesday at 7.30 a.m. on the Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start her NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in his move to the United States, and many teams asked about his excellent start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches left Hayne sitting after the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which he made in the conversion of the Australian rugby league during the first exhumation from the top at Tuesday’s 20:3 in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush was hurt.
Tomsula was also still honest in the playroom.
Instead of feeding the new ones before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, announced that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his mistake and only try to play another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for at his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 worse career start in NFL he shouldn't even imagine.
"It happens, you're just focusing on another game and that's all," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trap to his initial debut in 2007, when the recording in his own branch area led to the three Queensland.
It was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans on which he holds an Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin took part in a discussion on the rights of homosexuals
In 2003 Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested in targeted guns on the Siberian edge.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The U.S. stands for immigrants who have made a claim for the property.
Two of them emigrated in 1984, and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989 the property could no longer be restored, so the two returned to the state to claim damages under the law on extra-Community rehabilitation.
The Court first assigned them the required amount, i.e. over 2.8 million crowns, but their claim was amended by the Court, which granted them only a few nine thousand crowns with the reference that the amount of the refund is determined in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants stood before the Supreme Court and attached the amount originally charged to them.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned its complaint to the U.S.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the refund granted under the then applicable legislation - although it was then an adequate refund in relation to the property concerned - today only reaches a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of accompanying participants in the refund of authorised persons who have been seeking their rights at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to give their home a refund before," explained the judge, rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, why the U.S. has been on the side of immigrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly expressed itself in order to ensure that the general courts act in return cases in such a way that possible inconsistencies are not ruled out in the failings of authorised persons and that the purpose of the return procedure is always achieved, thus eliminating the property offence caused by acts of the former totalitarian State," the judge added.
Evitu in the music studio Studio DVA is now creating Radka Fisher.
Radka Fisher, by the way, became the world's youngest Evita, when in 1998 she became the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musician Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Theatre Spiral.
To return to the same role, he says, "Evita's engagement today has not been well-balanced."
Evita's not just a great role, it's also a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monika Absolon to the role of the first lady of Argentina.
I saw Moncza in Evita three times, and it was definitely inspiring to me.
I saw a whole new concept here all of a sudden.
I'm all in favour of the most modern adjustments, but this one is just specifically mentioned.
"The Ondřje Sokola region is original, remote and contemporary," says Fisher.
The musical train between the two singers will be held at the Christmas concert of Monica Absolon on September 27 from 19 hours in Studio DVA.
He's doing Evita's compositions tonight.
The experience will certainly include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Utish your cry, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances from the director's pultic will also jump off Ondřej Sokol when the film will be filmed by Karl Roden in the role of President Perón.
In the interest of the public, further terms were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech studio of the Evita world musician launches the studio Studio DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
In the state of Ondřje Sokola, Monica Absolon originally taught the main role of women.
On her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strénáčík.
The legendary song from the work of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with the Czech texts of Michael Prostějovský sounds in the presentation of a live orchestra led by Kristof Mark, who has already participated in the first introduction in the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after the police shot rubber missiles at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber missiles to the table of demonstrators against the new state constitution, he introduced an official on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupande District, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior periodic officer, says that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal points out that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they turned to rubber missiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber missiles, known for their ability to kill, were traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This was the last week of violent demonstrations across the southern mountain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic groups said they had set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which requires the creation of its own country.
Since August 10, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent shootings.
when the four main political parties signed the agreement on dividing the country into the province — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally controlled for centuries.
New constitutions have lasted since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process after the earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted this week in Kathmandu on the draft constitution and officials indicated that the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We mustn't panic right now.
After losing the ice of the master Lithuania, you did not even have a home duel with hockey player Sparta (3:5).
Don't you have any fear of a similar catastrophic entry into an extralige like a year ago?
I hope nothing like this is happening again.
Congratulations, Folk.
NHC predicts 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands is likely 60 percent in the development of the tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the American National Hurricane Centre reported on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60 percent probability of developing tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, adding weather forecast with a seat in Miami.
Google dropped the campaign to choose 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has stated that it will launch a campaign aimed at choosing $11 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who have sailed the European States in the course of the war against the deprived and the poor.
Google announced this on its blog a very unusual way.
The report on her blog was published by an employee of Google Rita Masoud on the basis of personal experience, when as a seven-year-old she drowned her family from Kabul.
"We traveled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is still more families, as it has, willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made through the google.com/refugeerelief website amount to $5.5 million double.
Europe faces the greatest wave of refugees from World War II. Most of them come from Syria, rejected by the four-year war, which has only defeated 4 million people this year.
Many people also run away from the war of rejected Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly obese diabetes, there may be a useful surgery of loss
The benefits of losing surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too soon to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after the surgery of loss than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
"The data on mortality lasts for a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on the surgery of death, who wrote an introductory to a new study of JAMA surgery.
Surgery operations, bariatric surgery use different methods to reduce stomach.
Reduction of hunger and restriction of the human body to absorb food.
During the years, bariatric surgery was shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the study was performed in people with morbidity with an index of body weight (BMI) of 25 or more.
BMI, which measures the height-related balance ratio, is considered to be normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate the weight of persons and people with a value above 30 are considered binding.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital Min-Sheng in Taiwan used data collected from the study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastrectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatment procedures in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery was reduced from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to study.
In the meantime, BMI remained at approximately the same level as those who were not given diabetes surgery.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and in part in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 per cent and only 2 per cent of patients were completely resolved for the comparison of diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored patients on the level of A1c haemoglobin in the blood that reflects the transient level of blood sugar in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7 percent, according to researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin of A1c decreased by about 9 per cent to approximately 6 per cent.
However, this value remained at about 8 percent in the group treated.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After five years, the group lost more weight bypass compared to the gastro-tomy (18.7 to 14.2 kg), achieved higher reductions in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and had a higher incidence of diabetic remission (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to a long life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent more likely to survive in the next 15 years compared to a group that tested more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in the survival of patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it is a reassuring result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Just here this work is critical, because it indicates that surgery is the safest in the lower BMI group," it says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone further claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after the decrease in BMI patients between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long for giving people the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think once you've gathered these genetic changes, which are firmly interfering their bodies with obsessive and sugarcane, the road back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to understand all refugees, Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the near future.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in refugee countries.
Dalajlam addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He claimed that, under the present circumstances, human interest should be put to the fore in the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, no matter how amazing, in the refugee crisis, was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to solve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring true peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We have to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also voiced complaints on George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the US violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in President Bush's letter and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent road.
I know his motives were good, but he used his strength and created unexpected consequences," he told Dalailam.
A 4-fold increase in the number of children who have experienced a sanitation disease in the last 4 years
The toxicology centre around the United States reported an almost 400-percent increase from 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years of age, who had swallowed a highly alcoholic cure, according to the toxicological centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the toxicological centre of Georgia, the number of use of sanitation in children up to 12 years of age who were reported at the control centre of poison increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children receive these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to emergency," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink sanitation deliberately, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
The videos on Youtube show the natility of drinking a cure because of a cheap habit.
The ugliness was reportedly mixed with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive flavor of the medium.
"Children don't think about it could hurt them," Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitary means) are those that are perfumed.
At the disposal are sanitary products with honey of strawberry, grape or orange, which are very palatable for children.
The medicinal product contains between 45 % and 95 % of alcohol.
Especially in young children, several holes can mean alcohol poisoning.
"It's a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 station at Kansas City Medical Director of the Toxicological Control Centre at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let the glass of whiskey go down like that, but people leave these sanitations out there and when they get their kids, it's a fast way to consume alcohol.
Nhaija Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently saw up to four places in the school with an oats and was taken for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is a double value of dust considered to be a maturity in adults, according to Dr. Chrise Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Guinnett Medical Center outside the Atlantic.
Nhaija spoke words indistinctly and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate childhood hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell for alcohol and got into her head, Ritchey says.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange for children’s access to sanitation.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation devices have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the collection of a cure containing toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Doctors thought that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, more than ethanol, which was indicated as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year-old students in North New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products in the room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and banned their presence in the room.
The police considered a moderate plan as "innocent complaints," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Fama: No conflict in Celtic team
Griffiths is baggagetizing the talk about the riot in Celtic, while Deala admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he's turning it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton worried that the new forces from the ice will break the team unit.
Dons increase their visibility over Celtic by 5 points
Penalties from the first half of Adama Rooney's administration assured Aberdeen of a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, which gave Dons a five-point drive between himself and Celtic.
Griffiths refuses to talk about dissatisfaction
This situation has led to riots in Celtic, which have been opposed by Griffiths, which insists that he and his associates do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparations for the struggle with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivals bore the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Deputy Rangers and former Dutch representative Ronald de Boer argues that the Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them for title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador Ajax, says, "In the Netherlands, they don't show it the best of Celtic matches anymore, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers.
Now people aren't just talking about the Rangers return.
He's talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together, and they're just interested in that.
In the old company's games, there's a lot of tension and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'm turning things back to the good, Deal's committed.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a bit confused, but the Norwegian chief committed himself to turning things back to the good.
The defeat of Malm and the following descent from the League of Masters was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now is referring to the top of a five-point board.
But Dale says, "Celtic's been through a bad time and he's getting up again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad with the current action.
We're quite the same - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic support, because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay with you.
Warburton's worried about the icebox.
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his ice targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is worried about the large purchase of power and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox team.
Former Chief Brentford says, "The ice crossing window is very different from the summer."
Players coming in summer have a whole pre-season period to stay, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage will occur by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Transitional objective of Celtic Michu indicates retirement
The attacker Swansea Mich, who was associated with Celtic in the crime window, indicated that after the termination of his contract with Swansea, he could go to retirement.
A 20-year-old shooter has had two years of trouble with an intruder and has failed to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Nelson
Hearts led 2-1 when Patterson was sent to the closet and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defense was later cancelled - one of the third red cards issued by decision-makers Colum, which was revoked.
Nelson stands behind his claim and says, "I have no doubt about integrity, I have not commented on the performance."
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tynacastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely beaten after admitting he was singing a song with a text focused on the former player Hearts Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a dangerous moment," the attacker said and continued, "I can safely say I'm not going back to Tynacastle unless it's in Celtic dress."
The Council in Tanzania believes in Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United still believes in repairing the situation by the current team management - but admits that the crash on the game must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
McCinnes likes to be "sudden victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to fight against Hamilton Accies desperately in order to succeed in winning the seventh league victory after themselves and five-point jump ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the first half of Adam Rooney's administration.
McInnes says, "There's no team that won anything, whether a cup or a league, without winning this kind of fight."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged while the UK's total unemployment is rising
INFORMITY in Scotland remains unchanged in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The measure of Scotland's unemployment was 5.9 per cent above the level in the UK (5.5 per cent), as reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 during the three-month period, the number of workers now stands at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased by 70.0 per cent during the quarter - which is the number above the British average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State of Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly the year that Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we witnessed further improvement in the labour market and Scotland's employment grew while unemployment decreased.
Why was I a witness to the reform in Oklahoma?
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'm going to watch a man die.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in the visiting gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who's going to be corrected by a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officers who will testify to his death.
I first received an invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day draws on, I'm starting to be afraid of it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way I can tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that reporters should be allowed to observe the corrections in America, and since there are often more requests than free space, a morbid lottery is carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will be watching the whole repair immediately.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've made a special tour of him through a month's phone call and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that kid.
We laugh often when we talk together.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to remember all the details.
One of Oklahoma's reporters accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell him the story of how he's gonna talk to him, get access.
I've been complaining to her.
She admitted that "it could have formulated better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could ever remove me from the witness list.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help the death penalty proceedings.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post journalist, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His crimes after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of a felony crime.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty has not been provided.
In my opinion, the correction is wrong.
And from this point of view, I'm going to watch his death.
I can't say I'm really being objective.
To that end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a man I love dying the rest of my life.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he expelled a man from Canning River.
A man's brother from Petrha, who is running away from the police, did not leave after he got into some boiling water just a few feet from a policeman who tried to force him to come back to the shore.
The police from Canning Vale were called up in an incident over to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to escape them by fleeing the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated I won't go out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and the police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do something fun when they run," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins football champion gives a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove a car to the ground to avoid the bus and tried to cross the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired locals to start planning the Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the speakers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peeter Moody accused the editor of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spaghetti last year and threatened to put an end to the race immediately.
He focused on the director and integrity department Racing Victoria and came out of the conviction that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late kidnapping during the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and felt in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive harvest on a cobalt that he couldn't explain.
He went into the language about the accusations of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like a "dry threat."
"I didn't mean to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you're just feeling so frustrated that it's all coming out of you all at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to come up with my head up and let the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If I start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Earlier Moody released a bomb in his conversation for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Before eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him employment in my booths for finding information about things that are going on in my booths," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information because they're trying to catch me completely burned.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a couple of balls and arrange for people outside the training station to take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe this is where people think they are.
Maybe they need me to take my license and drive me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now gives them the material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care about it anymore, and I'm sad about it.
I'm really sorry.
I'm going to press them, and I'm going to hand them over to make a decision.
I have support for my family and I can leave.
The frustrations of the coach increased with the long-term investigation for cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent kidnapping in it sparked the feeling that "an hour of his license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the undamaged Black Caviar champion, marked the treatment rule on the day of the race for "Laughter" after the horse was applied to his feet with clay or mud, which is contrary to the rules.
It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
Someone from my team failed to bring a mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and so did it.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody was faced with a three-month qualification for the treatment of the store on the day of the race, where the officers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The cobra driver who caught it was arrested.
The police arrested a man who hit a cyclist on the weekend in Cobra and left after he left.
The cyclist was transported by plane to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by cars on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping and helping the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to the Shepparton police.
It is expected that it will be accused of non-compliance, non-help and other traffic offences.

Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns to the rivals due to the wrestling claim
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised his players' moves as "planning" to two NRL primeship favorites.
Trent Robinson, Coach Sydney Roosters, said the decision-makers allowed the players of Storm to "wrestle" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team at the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made a light-cut note on Strorm after his team won the final qualification over North Queenland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "preview" the rugby league and according to him, two of Queenland were not "too big" at the wrestling.
Bellamy defended the moves of his players and said they were focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his self - awareness because his team was criticised by two leading coaches, which may mean they are afraid of losing the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were defeated 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that in the last year, we haven't changed anything from our defence system and technology, and in the last few weeks, we've only been focusing on contact during the events, which meant turning around.
Trent's been here for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to playing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come into this part of the year.
Bellamy underestimated Bennet's idea of "suffering football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiere by playing "sudden" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
He was right in that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. He was as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play a style game that seems overwhelming, especially his young supporters with their speed.
Such a football you'd like to play if you had this type of player available.
He said that in 2010 and now he wants all the teams to play his football style - but not every team has two hostages like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It arouses more self-consciousness in me because they say things like that because they're afraid of fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got into big fights.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the battle Storm and Roosters fell more branches than in the match Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos team was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or is it interesting to stop and do not score?
I think it's an agenda.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again in a certain phase.
Storm has a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Counboys or Cronulla Sharks at the preliminary final next Saturday evening in AAMI Park. The tickets will be in sale from the morning of the next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $20,000 bail for drug charges
A man who faced the potential risk of holding 40 kilograms of cocaine, which was crushed from Queensland, received a bail of $20,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men who was arrested last month by the federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, who came from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Coomer in August.
Maximovic was watched at a meeting with the defendants at the port in the morning and later met with them at Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he was facing a potential judgement of his life for the possession of commercial quality cocaine, lawyer Maximovice defended that there was no evidence that he owned the whole quantity and could be in the cafe entirely accidental and innocent.
The judge of the highest court, Peter Flanagan, believed that Maximovic would flee.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
The mother and stepfather Maximovice jointly offered bail of $20,000 for his release.
"After reading both people's sworn statements, it is obvious that the deposit of USD 200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their own efforts were apparently insufficient, since the accused did not remain in court, he warned.
Maksimovic has been given bail on the condition that he surrenders both an Australian and a Serbian passport, will report to the police daily and will observe the ban from 18 hours in the evening to 6 a.m.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to push pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used the phone of a eleven-year-old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, then logged in to her online chat, where he had a lot of bad pictures of kids who sent him another user.
The girl then checked out and found out that she was missing her phone and then found it in Hogg's hand.
She passed by him, and before she warned her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police were involved and saw five photos, then the analysts found the address and found "anxious" searching on the web using expressions to search for unbalanced images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was "telling pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretends he's a police officer and scares them."
A fiscal representative, Elid Robertson, told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was a dependency - that he was dependent on fear of people.
He admitted that the computer search was carried out by him, but he claims he just wanted to pretend he's a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send more.
According to him, he was doing it because he was trying to push them.
He claims he's been overindulged and said he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on her phone, she called her mother, she was scared and cried.
She saw unbalanced images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the accused used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a residence in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty of bringing an action in respect of the adoption or provision of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January and failed to be heard before the court on 24 March of this year.
Defendant lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual delinquents, because he could argue that in his act there was "no basic sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his ruling in October on the notification of social workers.
Hogg was secured in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sexual delinquents before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also confirmed by the opposition legislators' claims that they received anonymous threats of killings that they had warned them of Mr Mugabe's execution during his speech.
Last month he was drafted and provoked during his speech on the state of the people in parliament - which is the word he repeated on Tuesday.
The president of the Movement for a Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians had adopted text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that doesn't appear, but it's called 'death'," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and as soon as it leaves Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief stated that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai had "supply" about threats to the MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs by 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard abolishes 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within its efforts to restructure and save the costs of business services.
The HP company will later be divided into two companies listed in the stock exchange and will split the business with computers and printers from its faster growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, according to the HP declaration.
"This restructuring activity will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and chairman of the delegation, which will be headed by the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than it is today in HP and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of shops that will help businesses move into a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers all over the world.
Hewlett Parkcard Enterprise will have more than $50 billion a year after the company's declaration and "will focus on providing non-competitive integrated technology solutions" to the company.
This results in the deployment of the company, which was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who produced electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was renamed "the home of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This trend of HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the conviction that a highly specialised company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says co-workers have to get hurt Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there's no reason he doesn't play again about Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from a history point of view, its involvement in the next annual European championship is obviously not true.
The great damage to this newest problem is that Wilsher ended the last season strong after injury to the ankle and then returned to the former form during the preselection.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger says.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's not about anything special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injury he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern.
The research carried out by Primer Injuries Ltd records 23 different injuries to Wilshera since six years ago.
During the last five years, he only played in 65 league matches in Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in the sixth of the eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs who lost most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the charmed circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably coming out.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Oliver Giroud instead of Nacho Monroe Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and let the players who need it breathe," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F group process, Maximir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most threatening stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after the last season held the campaign "invincible".
At midnight, the stadium was struck by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Ritchter.
This year, in Zagreb, it was a year and a half ago.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal has learned from the last season of the League of Champions, when he was capitalising against Monaco, and is left with a distant hope that he will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This setting is huge," Wenger says.
Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious instruction about male friendship
The absence of similar views in various shows is striking in the eyes, especially in view of the need for men to open up more desperate than ever in the case of suicide among young men under 15 years of age.
In 2013, it was the only cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the United Kingdom and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Men, whose aim is to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
In the heart of this battle there is friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of over 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that in case the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends represents a half chance of mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, of course, it must be possible first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, we have doubled our need to look stronger, more loving and more successful, even though we are actually more isolated.
This superficial success is governed by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - that have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker recently explained, money really doesn't buy more luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this idea to him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their qualities, which were reflected through friendly interaction.
Joey's humour and Chandler's frequent victims, while watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all the insights of knowing that, yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually leave their feelings for themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: ..."My role as listeners to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with their friends.
The old order "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the things that will come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term reconciliation mechanism.
It highlights a few moments in a man's friendship.
With regard to my task, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a closer, network of friends and family.
So if you're going to the FriendsFest scheduled Comedy Central station this weekend, why don't you take your friends on a glass to Central Perku, where the interior for the occasion of the celebration will be completely reprocessed.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be sent to Comedy Central station from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped the PSG place Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuid and Edinson Cavan after shooting the branch against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored his debut in the League of Masters and thus helped the PSG to defeat the Swedish Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's a report on the fight and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in the Tuesday match and Paris Saint-Germain started their trip to the League of Masters with a final 2-0 victory against Malma at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the band less than four minutes after her debut in the League of Masters and this player PSG sent French champions after winning, but then they threw a few chances when they finally raised their lead when Cavani shot the band in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they focus not only on the qualification of the miners, but on improving their journey to the quarter finals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they won three points, it wasn't the classic performance of the Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic team, he was a white marnotate and later he was appointed against his home team and club, where he started his career in 1999.
"In the Masters' League, it is not easy to win outside or home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in the defense is a good start, even though there are things that we will have to improve with the season process," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two more branches.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of the three changes of the PSG team, which made this weekend 2-2 with Bordeaux in Lisa 1, but was framed by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moved the PSG in Europe to a new level after a transition from Manchester United, which took place last month, and showed why when he ran on Marc Verratti's passport for Malma's defense and with a beautiful marriage he sent a sword behind Johan Wilanda's back to the remote corner of the branch.
However, if someone expected it to start a great PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off and got to this stage, took place with 9 internationals in the basic assembly and five defenders and two hidden hostages were a difficult opponent.
But besides shooting Nikola Djurdjice, who just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trappa's branch in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG himself took advantage of the attack by bad tapes and malicious conclusions that were not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot reached the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, it proved much more appropriate when it came to the preparation of a chance for its partners and it was from his recording when Di Maria sent a puncture shot that ended in Wildand's Brance in 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayic head sent the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic played him after the recording from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended all of Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could get something out of the match, and only the thorough progress of the Wilda from a very close has faded the hopes of David Luize and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of striking Ezequiel Lavezi was unknown at the end of the match.
Coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was high above his team, Nor stated: "Our last game in the League of Masters took place in December last year."
Since then, we have played only a Swedish league that is not at the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Downstairs for Paris.
It was a great match for them.
Glencore company made $25 billion for sale of shares
The commercial giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, who was hit by the collapse of the commodity prices, made an average of $2.5 billion from the sale of shares under its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is faced with a decline in commodity prices, as the Chinese slowdown in the economy reduces demand and exacerbates market developments.
The rights issue sent Glencore to the top of the London stock market in early morning shops in the middle of the price.
The shares jumped by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 FTSE 100 pensions, which opened by 0.69 per cent above.
Glencore found last week that sales of shares worth $25 billion are part of wider plans to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which accumulated about a third
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pence for the share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
Thus, 1.3 billion shares were released at a total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
Concerns about the extension of Chinese growth have reduced the price of iron mines by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping visits the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25th in Barack Obama's response to a visit to Beijing, where the president called in November.
American President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his even Peng Liyuan to the state dinner that will take place after the talks are over.
"The visit of President Xi provides an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between the USA and China and invites cooperation in addressing problems in the fields of international, regional and common interest and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the disagreements between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he meets several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and will then continue to New York at the UN September session.
Obama and Xi are expected to deal with controversial problems, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberspionage and its growing aggressiveness in the waters of the South Sea.
Like a refugee crisis, the Schengen area has been broken down.
The emergency lights fired by Germany have not pushed the European crew far away, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, French journalist Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the refugee problem: it will rather systematically classify migrants and asylum-seekers as soon as they move to the old continent - especially in Greece - than to argue about the future distribution of refugees on the basis of quotas, which are still far from reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, asked 25 of 28 EU countries to redeploy 160 thousand refugees, the ministers of the Member States' internal priorities changed.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, it is necessary to filter those who are already arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary for managing migration," the text discussed by the minister in Brussels on Monday.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases its pressure.
It renews border controls, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the presence of asylum seekers in this country.
The central power thus makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France also consider this, although with different intensity.
Hungary has moved on to this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but it's also blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, in southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone abroad.
The French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière had an intensive discussion with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea isn't new, but it's real.
In Italy, according to informal statistics, two-thirds of the new arrivals have already been registered and identified by fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any point of entry in its territory, for they fear more than others to remain in its camps where refugees would gather on its account.
There's a real black hole left in Greece.
On his islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200 thousand people arrived this year, twice as much as they had reached Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after the overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge wall opening.
Athens, which are still in financial turmoil and are waiting for a new government, have put their hands into the clay.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and the source of the current common care for the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's commission promises that the check points will be introduced as soon as possible, but it has not given a number or a date.
"The challenges Greece faces relate to Europe as a whole," EU ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
It is therefore up to the European Border Control Agency's task force in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for the reception of asylum-seekers and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"The need for adequate financial resources," warns ministers to approve the text.
From the point of view of law, they will still have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the creation of genuine European border guards was not officially raised, but Europe is getting closer to it.
The new emergency situation of the eight-year-old has been remedied to the second round of mandatory quotas and 160 thousand refugees, which the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament had been brought to the fore by Angel Merkel and French President François Hollande since the beginning of the year.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their superiority.
Number, not duty, was kept in text approved by most of the eighties on Monday.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the EU's Hectic Summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under the couch in the Alps, of which there are three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the German authorities, there is also a woman who survived as one of the affected eight-year-olds.
The previous news from the media said it was Polka.
A woman in her 30 ’ s was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury.
According to the AFP, the dead were mostly forty.
"Saved action ended, the body of the victim was also transferred to the identification of Briancon," explained Hautes-Alpes Prefect Pierre Besnard.
Unfortunately it happened around noon in the mountainous area of Pelvoux under the top of the mountain Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden wave was 250 metres wide and about a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, chief of lifeguards.
According to him, a group of eight - foot [3,900 m] snow covered a huge amount of snow.
Meteorological service today did not prevent bad weather.
Torso before the battle with Brago: Finally, Europe is right.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, at his premiere in the Cup, managed to pass through the front of the European League to the core group with the football player Liberce and now he and his team are looking forward to enjoying the right Europe.
Slovan at the opening of the main stage of competition welcomes the finalist from the year 2011 Bragu and according to the knocker she wants to make her play style.
After all the nerves in the exhausting fights, when every goal and every situation could get you on your way to the dream group, now we're there and we're gonna play six matches.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every incassed branch, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by just double-crossing.
"I'm very happy about it and it's a real Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpišovski said at the press conference.
Well, he thinks he's a top team.
It will be very active, they have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent might be even harder to say that he doesn't have a name, but then he has a player in his tent who gave Manchester a shower of three balls.
"It's an excellent whole at the top level of teams," Tropišovský said.
But Brag doesn't think so.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we've both shown in the home competition and in the past that we're strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," the viewer whose team lost from eleven duels this season was just the opening Superpohr in Plšna.
They believe that Liberec can also make Braze use of his style.
We're waiting for a team that's gonna be strong on the ball, at the same time they're untypically disciplined for them.
They play 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, but we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important will be how our players will do it on the playing field," said Trpišovski.
In the past, we have studied a lot of competitors, which has helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have also contributed to training.
"And we definitely want, even though it will be very demanding to play according to our notes," the visitor added.
Student films dominate the sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries reported their work in the 15th year of the International Student Film Festival in Pisa this year.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the finals by the commission of students and educators, will take place from 15 to 18 October in the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be the international jury, spokesperson for the Jakub Charvát festival.
Every year, the festival has its special theme, which takes place from the festival hall.
She's a detective this year.
Director of this year's celebrations Richard Blumenfeld plans to connect television, film and theatre elements in them.
"And of course we also have to resolve the crime that has been committed in our tour this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting of student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by the international jury, for example the winner of the last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The festival's organizers are preparing a follow-up program every year.
Come Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player at Didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, turbošanson group We fly?, plays the chapel of grain or, for example, Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will host two photo exhibitions.
First import of the graduate of the sand film school and the holder of prestigious awards, including that of the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Aschenbrenner.
The second exhibition is approaching the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
On the floor with visitors comes cameraman and documentary Martin Čech, the film The Cameraman accompanied his music by Gerhard Gruber and the writer's parents Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the workshop of Sochaer Jan Novotný will circumference his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year, we also remember Miroslav Ondříčka, the patron of FAMO in Pisca, who had recently left us.
Our school and festival are his link that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties and film novels," the speaker said.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, graduate several job competitions at once and gain such a job position.
The festival is connected with the creation of the Private Higher School of Film in Písk.
Its founders, Vladana's husband and Miloň Terč, organized the first anniversary in 1997.
By the sixth year, he took place once in two years.
In the event of a loss of CK, insurance companies are required to pay the customer's claims in full.
The insurance companies should build customer claims when the travel office falls in full.
It decided on this on Wednesday when it approved the amended new legislation on conditions of business in road traffic.
Travel agents will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee, according to the proposals to be considered by the Senate.
Insurance companies with an obligation to build client claims and above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development for adaptation takes on, argues, the consumer's protection.
The insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel offices against fraud when new payments are made.
But the proposal also criticises travel agents.
Without insurance, they're either gonna have to end up or go abroad.
The Ministry of Local Development Karl Šlechtová (for the UN) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not eurocompatibilities.
She pointed out this year's decision by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to full repayment of the money regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information on the management of travel offices and will be able to set the right limit, Šlechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but must have such a limit to be feasible," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
He says the bank guarantee won't work because no one gives it unlimited.
"The travel officers will have to finish or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
The Chairman of the Association of Czech Travel Offices and agent Tomio Okamura (SPD) did not agree with the fears of Kalousk on the basis of a survey between the members of the CK.
"Stop leading us lobbying insurance," he said.
The insurance statement shall not constitute a relevant Ocamura, nor shall any of its official written statements in that sense, in its opinion.
But they're trying to figure out if the travel agents are gonna make a date, which is not what Okamura says.
She also warned Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the Czech Competition Association of Travel Offices, and her colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke of climbing stairs to the Czech Travel Office.
According to Fisher's travel agents, insurance will not be able to sit down.
"Consumer protection works," says Fischer.
Her proposal to release the disputed passport was not approved by the House.
Nor did Vojtēch Filip (KSČM) come forward with a proposal to refer the proposal to the Committee for a alleged dispute with the civil law.
Philip pointed out to the travel agencies that he considered to be a danger to consumers.
The rapporteur, Mr Berdichová (ANO), in view of the wording of the Constitutional Court, drew up his proposal to limit the liability of insured persons in cases where they could not know that the insurance does not cover the whole risk.
In the novel, there will be no originally proposed minimum four million insurance for travel agents offering flights and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus tickets.
The margin will remain at 30 per cent of the planned market for the sale of tickets.
However, the limit of insurance enforcement will have to be such that, in the event of an accident, the travel officer will cover all customer claims.
The standard, even after adjustments, provides that travel agencies will have to re-instate the travel agency that organizes the journeys at the sales tickets.
Travel agents will have to submit insurance before the contract is concluded, inter alia, information on the management and number of entry.
The approved amending proposal for a Committee on Public Administration shall also be included with further regular information.
Travel agents will have to provide them with monthly information on the number of passengers and the sales of tickets, the total price of the tickets sold and the amount of stocks and markets for and for tickets.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel office has failed to fulfil any of the statutory obligations to insurance, it shall invite it, as proposed, to repair or be able to prohibit the conclusion of new contracts if the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
Novela is also going to adjust the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of aid granted to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will always be made by the end of April for the next year.
The request will contain a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan of expenditure and a two-year perspective.
According to the association, the legislator did not consider what would happen if the insurance company issued the CK contract.
This one won't be remanded by the tickets and the customers who bought the tickets before they were insured, so they'll come up with it according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even damage, although its management was in good condition.
One of the ways in which travel agents can address such a situation will be a claim for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use a lot of soft conditions abroad, and then on our market we will act only as agencies, said the Vice-President of the Jan Papaž Association.
Although the proposal of the novel also contains a bank guarantee institution, it is so unimaginable that it cannot be implemented in practice because the bank guarantee cannot sound an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in the practice of modern times is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, it will be necessary to recast the whole law in the light of the new EU Directive.
The Czech market is now operating a total of 942 active insurance travel offices.
This year, only three CKs have finished their activity.
Foreign travel offices sell annual flights worth about 20 billion CZK.
Merkelová: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be set up to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
It was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the talks with the German prime minister.
At the same time, she again called for the division of refugees who had already joined the EU between the eight countries.
We need to help more countries where refugees leave, if any, where they stay after they leave the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are on a decent footing in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, that a German office said that such a signal could also be more financial aid or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"Scolt countries also support the German government in promoting a fair spread of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel added.
Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke said in this connection at the press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU states.
The allocation of EU staff on the basis of long-term quotas, inter alia, will be rejected by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woodke also spoke to speed up the asylum process in Germany.
People need to know first if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start with the integration of foreigners more quickly, the armored prime minister said.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of the routine should serve to integrate those who have a chance to obtain asylum.
It'll take more teachers to get the refugees to handle the Germans.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the practice can be integrated, they can benefit us, he said.
Matt Damon's baggageing diversity in the movie
Matt Damon confronted the African filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity with the claim that it wasn't necessary behind scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the HBO project Greenlight interrupted the actor in Brown's series, stressing the need for alternative views about black protagonists in the scenario.
"When we're talking about diversity, you're doing it by film storage, not by show storage," says Damon.
She was shocked, she reacted in contempt to Brown, and she woke up "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about Martán got sent.
Damon and Brown joined the well-known producer Ben Affleck and Brother Farrelly to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think that anyone is already the director, how they will behave as Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black character that's a hooker that packs a white passport.
The producer of Dear White People promoted the finalists of Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to direct the film; Damon said that their regime "would eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was over, the social media exploded in harmony with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni voiced his appreciation for writing the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black man in the room, so he can explain to her that the diversion is so VERY that it hurts."
Tweet got more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 people since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social debate.
After killing the teenager Michael Brown, a white police officer in 2014, the movement of Black Lives Matter gained national effect and pressed on the creator of laws and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colouring people.
In February, the singer Prince made an effort to move, while stating the rated albums in the category of the year during the Grammy price transfer.
"Both are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, the albums are still important.
The latest leading Black Lives Matter made a statement in answer to the question of personality Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as an hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leaders declared.
Damon was recently reported on the list of entertainment, producers and the media of mussels who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the display of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met with the pope is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
A professional horolozec and little Isaac Caldiero became the first contest winner to win American Ninja Warrior on Monday and take home one million dollars.
In the competition, which has just concluded its seventh season, none of the competitors have been able to overcome all obstacles to the track.
During the final season this year, two men raced into the last car, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was 30 seconds of more than 220 m long wool.
Britten graduated as the first and in a fixed limit and became so the first competition that in the American Ninja Warrior won a forceful 4 plays, but Caldiero won it in three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave a press interviewE! News immediately after his hard-earned victory and it was known that he is still in shock from winning the main prize worth $1 million.
"It's a wonderful feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," said Isaac E! in response to my win.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like now."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finals and why Britten doesn't get any reward despite the fact that he became the first competitor to finish the track.
According to the rules, money belongs to those who complete the track as soon as possible.
“If more competitors are lost, the win is won with the best time,” Weed said.
Although winning the main win would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he'd wear a vest.
It's nice to see him get what he's done.
He got a warm reception from the fans.
He's a great man and he likes his family.
It's a hero for your children and your wife."
Geoff told me, "If there should be someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, starting in spring 2016.
The tigers from Detroit just passed by Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For tigers from Detroit, the second half of the season was just a walk through the pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is now located in the last location of the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers just turned down their defeat when they beat Minnesota in the Tuesday battle with a close result of 5-4 at Target Field.
The twins missed the chance to approach the Houston Astros team and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Even though for one night only, for Detroit, it was the return of the word to Z, which was so incapacitating for them during the second half of the season.
"Playing is always fun and does not depend on how," said the manager of the Tigers Brad Ausmus.
The Tygró Nadzaztor Alfredo Simon held his offensive performance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another one in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the rivals 6 1/3 of the fuels and 3 of the runs.
It was his only third game from the last nine matches.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," said Simon.
“It’s hard to get into a fight when you often sit on the bench and that’s why I want to get right into the game.”
Victor Martinez was beaten three times and made 2 rounds and his first download point from mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first tribial match since the last June game, in which he met four times in the battle against Seattle Mariners.
"He's quite cool about it," said Ausmus.
"He looked good on the train, he fired considerably better and managed to get it into the fight."
Thanks to three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins got the greatest chance to return to the game.
The middle polar Byron Buxton got a shift thanks to two points on the left-hand side of the game.
The true polar Aaron Hicks scored a point due to the set thumb and Simon ripped Brian Dozier off before he was replaced by the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy had his only opponent Maure, and in front of him was Colonel Miguel Sana, who fired the ball and ran for two years and left Drew VerHagen behind.
With two ball players and a chance to remix in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third meter over two years.
Plouffe has already won 27 rounds over two years in this season and reigns the league tables.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer got two points downloaded and Bruce Rondon secured score 5-4 for Tigers.
However, this line was designed by Sana on three occasions.
Detroit took advantage of the advantages and won points in the game of Phil Hughes.
The tigers won three rounds in the first two shifts against the victor who got into the game after more than a month's break due to the inflammation of the back muscles.
“I certainly didn’t present myself like this,” Hughes said, “but during the third shift, I already felt that I could get better.”
After resisting the effort in the first shift, Hughes left one point at the second metre of Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the real polar J.D. Martinez took Victor Martinez, who was the first to complete all the years.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.
Third meter Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the game and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was beaten when he tried to reach the third grade.
The tigers added in the second shift when their shooter James McCann and polar Anthony Gose won two points and scored one point and on the result table lighted score 3-0.
"That's what got us to the knees," said the manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it to the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of uppers, ended in the third round without points and replaced him with A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three years, got six burns and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, a real tiger player, ended the battle with pain in the right shoulder.
He'll be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, which is on the list of damaged muscles in the shoulder since mid-August, should be in the middle battle.
Sancheze will replace the left Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and rise against the twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was replaced as David Price's left transponder, he's scored 1-1 after 4 matches.
Since August 20th, however, he hasn't played for the muscle.
Tigers and Twins play a third match at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) the Minnesota left transponder is set up by Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening up of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is Tuesday's reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," said the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group to deepen overall reform.
The promotion of parental openness brings new impetus and vitality, it also provides a new space for economic growth, Xi says.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory approaches to the market, the release of border control policies, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and reorganise the residence registration system.
The declaration indicates that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be progressively tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring the legal environment and making the market more open, it states the declaration.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and ensure that companies themselves will decide how to manage their business.
The declaration also states that China will enable the border area to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up a controlled sector by the State, more areas will be opened by private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies financed from abroad and provide them with better services," the statement states.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permit for permanent stay or for a "green card", thanks to optimizing requirements and simplifying the application process.
The rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and civil servants were also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and lead representatives Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as stated after the meeting.
A new bed department may be established in the region of Karlovar.
According to the Heitman of the Karlovar province of Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bed rooms of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the country should be adequately and partially adjusted on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
In the country, however, there are also opportunities for extending care.
For example, in the surgical department, a one-day surgery centre could be established where, according to the concept set out, the performance of the surgical districts that do not require hospitalization longer than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals should be the workplace based on one-day surgery, it is not clear yet.
In the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser centre could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an apalic centre, which would take care of patients with brain damage who are vegetative.
Such a centre should be centrally established and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility into an island hospital where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovar region, is the bed following care, and in particular the patient's long-term medical bed (LDN), whose capacity in Njedka is insufficient and above all should be closely monitored on the bed of care acute.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommend the concept.
As he points out, bed after bed is missing mainly in Karl Vary's hospital.
There they could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
In the last few years in Karlovary, social health care is absent with a focus on treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.
This bed is lacking throughout the Republic, so it could also serve other places as the so-called Alzheimer's Centre.
Hospitals should be prepared, as recommended, for the introduction of so-called emergency beds to which European funds will be released.
"It is a bed that will be placed on the fields of specialized care and will create space for the translation of patients after the process, for example, after the cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplanting or other process," the rural concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
