Your death will be painless.
You're a beautiful girl.
You're a boy.
You're an angel!
You're a fool.
You're cooking now.
You're cooking.
You're cooking.
You are driving slowly.
You are learning Irish.
You are our only chance.
You are reading.
You are reading.
That's how you'll fall!
You're sorry.
It's your face, Tom.
You're watching.
You're welcome.
You're kids.
You're full.
You are writing.
You're writing.
Your friend is here.
Your mother lives in the Gaeltacht.
You run.
You should finish the work.
You should ask him.
You're talking.
I understand you.
You have three drinks of coffee.
You would enter that post.
