Parliament did not support a novel liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused to cancel the proposal within the framework of the new criminal law paragraph, on the basis of which the leader of the opposition, Julia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would open the way for the release of the prisoner's diploma, was rejected by the Members at second reading of the proposal for a reduction of penalties for economic crimes.
In October, the Germans were sentenced to seven years in prison for concluding a allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia on the purchase of gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal against the defendant shall be brought by the court in December.
Tymoshenkov marks the judgment on the political verdict of the regime, suspected of being a court-martial in the West as well.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 from the criminal law, on which the expert was convicted, supported the vote of 147 Members.
For his approval, it took 226 votes.
Libya’s Victory
The story of Libya's liberation, or Libya's rebellion, has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after war.
It's still defining the winner.
As is customary in the country, in the election of the winning Islamists, it's about whether the settlement is or whether it's radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary right of the Sharia and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the hand is torn by theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, if any faith waste is waiting for correction and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, the company consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we certainly wouldn't want.
It's just that our way of life is not the only one, not the most objectively best and probably not the Libyans mentioned for the change.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors were grateful for the help of unbelieving dogs.
It is only a pity that from their point of view, some generals from America did not fly NATO, but Allah, whose size they celebrated at every given event.
So if they're looking for winners in Libya, the West doesn't belong to them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians were rid of a political alliance in the person of the dictator, without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we don't buy military.
The local fall is a problem with the ejection of "crossers".
But will they have no oil company for Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of unfair protection of human rights.
So, if we don't get it, then we're not gonna let you know about the Sharia law.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe went to search for investors
In Tuesday, the death was overrun across Europe.
Individual States have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has been stagnantly stagnant, Germany and France are growing.
But today's is a record market.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
HDP Germany grew by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data in the second quarter, in which Germany was closer to the expected growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%, and France indicated that it was found in a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data referred to as stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year.
However, over a quarter of a year, the gross domestic product (HDP) was stagnated and, according to the ČSU, it confirmed the trend of slowing the growth of economic performance.
The results are worse than analyst estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but stagnantly.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to the preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
The euro area economy and the European Union grew by 0.2 per cent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
Greece's economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent in the interim.
The value on her 10-year-old bonds is 28.45%.
The outputs of Italian and Spanish bonds are growing to critical limits.
Problems also start to feel Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium etc...
The Czech 10-year-old debt accounts are kept below 4%, although the situation in the region is worsening.
From Germany, it seems that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrates the 200 million process
Football representation the hardest task of the season managed!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful brown Petra Jiráčka won 1:0.
The Czech football even with a great deal of luck in the second half of the year, sparked a luxury leap out of the house and will not fail again at the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the process in the detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
Czech representations and thanks to the home death in marriage, the great Czech and Hernán Jiráčov won in Montenegro happy 1:0 and celebrates the process of the European Championship.
Because of the precise defense of the Czech population, the Blackhorses got into the pressure until the second half.
The fighters of the battle became Damjanovic with the Vučinic, who burned two great odds.
Even thanks to the great Czech representation of Peter Czech, neither the next year will miss the championship of Europe, the prize of about 200 million crowns is added to the foreign football money.
A lot of fighting football has been playing since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hard to get involved in the combination and played mostly around half a row.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense was precisely repudiating.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their gesture of support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday, in front of the facility, the students prayed before the object and then caused the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students of the University of Isfahan in Iran created a living shelter on Tuesday around Isfahan's nuclear technology centre, where uranium is processed.
They make it so obvious that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) noted that Iran, according to all, did not cease to seek nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities is being referred to in Israel.
Students prayed in the afternoon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then caused the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting the Iranian nuclear programme as much as possible, the Israeli press would, in addition to the Isfahan centre, also aim at the installation in Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Obtainer's menu: breakfast and dinner dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, with an excess weight of 9 percent of schoolchildren and dependents being 5 percent of children.
In most cases, the elderly come from a family with an unhealthy lifestyle, as he has shown in his current research.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns it surrounds.
There are, for example, up to half the number of children with normal weight in the table.
The minced vegetables had more than 19 per cent of the duration of the study prior to the study of the lighting action called Obeseita.
Also, in the Tulip families, it is not customary to sport, but most of today’s schoolchildren’s families - only 15 percent of the children responded that their parents would find time for active movement at least once a week.
Research among 900 children
The study was carried out at the end of last year’s school year and attended by 900 primary schools from all over Czech Republic.
It was already the second anniversary of the Obeseita action is not an accident that supports the General Health Insurance and Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 thousand pupils from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project.
Proper feeding and sufficient movement in the family is, however, one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children with obesity or even obesity.
"Only half of the people asked, for example, stated that it was five times daily in breakfast-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweeting, which is one of the basic prerequisites of the right diet," one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and dinner dinner
Experts point out that for healthy development there are also significant and relative details, including regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, at the same time, only 23 per cent of the families of schoolchildren are breakfasters.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
And the worst thing was finding out that in ten households he didn't eat at all.
Breakfast, then, is the basis for the right daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in pregnant children’s families, unhealthy foods are much more common.
Almost every - regardless of the weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 per cent).
Although she regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children in question, their parents were less than half the result - 15 percent.
Get your lunch.
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make up of the options offered by your own food according to your own taste and opinion.
"The worrying preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age are from a healthy diet far away from ideal."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of sweet, massive and sweet foods.
"The alarm is, in particular, a large form of sweet lemonades," the final survey report states.
For lunch as the main meal, the pasta won just over the poultry.
But children practically didn't want candy, and the shape of fish and sweet vegetables is low.
Immediate use of alcohol
At the same time, the research has shown that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the review group of research participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the lighting lecture Obezita is not an accident, there was in a number of cases a marked shift of preferences towards the principles of healthy food," the results of the project are indicated.
For example, it was in sweet lemonades, where more children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Also, children were more frequent in the poultry and fish questionnaire as the main food of the day and would limit sweet foods and nuts.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, hard-earned professionals
In the opening article on how to teach stylistics, I had so little experience that it had been a lot in the initial hours.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
Lectures of three professionals from the field, the clothing of problematic figures and the seminar on how it works.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer we get to the final test, the more information and practical tasks we have.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "twisted."
This time we and Director Allenko were discussing how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly commensurate character.
And there's a vast majority of them.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy's face back, no regular curves, and someone's weighing up again.
The stylist must know how to visually change the broad shoulder, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We've got tips like Jennifer Lopez's women, so bigger breasts and sides and tight belts, I'm going to be very impressed and at the same time don't dress a woman too challenging.
For example, if the difference between the belt and the sides is such that the skirts or pants do not really sit, then it will be worth listening to at least one such piece of peace.
Certainly you won't regret it, because perfectly falling clothes are for non-payment.
In a dress at peace you will feel much better than in a dress that constantly changes you, includes, stays in the walk and so on.
The male’s character may again be allowed to wear clothing with a shave, application, shave or pickup.
Of course, this type of information is a lot, so I'm glad that I've had a whole week to fix all the information in my head.
And I'm also afraid that in view of the homework assignment, it's until now.
Each of the course has received a dedicated celebrity, which is designed to create two outfits: day and night.
We need to take into account the current view, fashion style of the given personality and type of character.
I'm gonna "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, I am much better for myself than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently taken a hundred pounds (breath, please, in the background), or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the bills out of the magazines or search the Internet and print and then process the graphics.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relationship to the graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product pages in journals (on specific tasks, such as trendy cables, cables, etc.).
That's what the designer and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But it's until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
The Saturday lecture on the types of posts was just three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pocorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And the jerky stylist can work with one piece of clothes differently.
In this case, variability is key.
So you need to wear such a little bit (or if you want to start a little bit of a little bit) you can wear classics over jeans and shirts like a coat, but you can also wear it on a naked body, around the boat and picture it as a dress.
Or just to get your hands or your fists out, and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jakub.
Finally, I can see why we are holding on to all the teachings that combine with what, why, even in fashion magazines, we can see something else.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know again that the stylist must have prepared a lot more outfits than he's going to take.
So at the fashion story that will have ten sides (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be prepared to "sit" at least fifteen.
And also that the dress photo looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckda completely different from actually.
So we have to count on it when we make the outfit.
That the image and style make up half the success, confirmed Honza Kornny.
It's enough to look at Madonna, who's not exactly a wonderful singer, but the image and marketing made her the world's old man.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylistic services is still colder.
Even well-known faces consider it unnecessary (just because I know something, what I look like is secondary).
And if someone from us is going to create styling, then we have to calculate that with great probability he imposes a completely different (less) size than he really does.
Then there's nothing left but to google and find out if the bulwark didn't say that the celebrity in question was confused/depressed and so on.
Honza and Mario told us on Sunday at heart that the stylists are not enough to guide themselves in fashion and to be able to fix the outfit.
In his work, he communicates primarily with the people he's wearing, and so it's important to be a good psychologist.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
"If you're ordered by a manager to order her a dresser and add her some nice pieces, then you can't go out the whole box and say, oh, my God, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you commend and recommend what they are able to carry," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called payroll, or the bag on the spot.
It's the one you turn around the belt and you have all the property you need.
In addition to clear things, such as knives, hairdressing, or closing spindles, there is also a silon thread (with it the stylist helps with the photos of products such as cables or hats), special clips that we turn behind the dress if it is larger (spinning or other screws are not allowed, they would destroy clothes), or a little bit.
In order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick our shoes properly.
Even when photographing in a workshop where there's a flat surface, the scarf could damage itself, right outside.
And so we're glued and glued.
We can't even touch the boots so they don't get hurt by chance.
So there's a real need for an engagement.
Mario made me happy when my creation, without exception, praised.
I mean, that's not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we've heard about the second weekend of the course.
I'm starting to be as clear as it is as I can be that to devote yourself to styling at the professional level is really not a walk of pink fruit, whoever wants to say what he wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run runs across America.
Reviews
Originally unannounced rides with a series of completely residual left-wing errors change in the routine morning of the road.
Ambition has done a great deal, but it is not valid when no one clearly wanted to do anything else.
A new chapter entitled The Run was built before the issue of high expectations.
He promised that with the flight racing series Need for Speed, he would shift again a bit in the new direction and from playable shows appeared as a game that in the race of action race should not only be counted.
We were also curious about how the inserted passports, in which the main hero would come out of the car and run after his own.
As with the NFS series, many are slightly different from what we were waiting for.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down several remaining errors that appear in the series for almost a few years.
So it's not really a mistake, but it's more a demonstration of some sort of incomprehensible vulnerability of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are mentioned in a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will be seated on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive as the first in New York.
The idea is that there are a few interesting elements.
The track is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race goes on a different course and the given stages are planted in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
A man doesn't even have a moment to feel like he's still offering the game.
In addition, some of the environment is very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graph corresponds to the previous series.
So it's nothing global.
But the ride across the desert, winter landscape, or high in snowy mountains, works visually very pleasant.
In addition, competitions have been punished by some non-typical element from time to time.
In the desert, for example, you will face a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the contrary, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be caught by a candle.
Besides, they're pretty good at each other's race.
There's only a few of them, but that's enough.
You're trying to pass the required number of competitors (mostly a classic race), then you're running out of time (classic battle with the tracks) and then you need to have a duel with the only competitor.
Even the police will be involved from time to time, which continues to make all your efforts unpleasant.
The news is passports out of the car.
It's more about such interactive animation when Jack most of the time he sneezes in front of someone, and you have to help him in that way, so at the right time, you press the right button.
It's nothing complicated.
But it will surprise you that these passages are in play much less than you would expect (in particular maybe only three).
The result, however, is for the benefit of the thing, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and, in the context of the above, it is in line with the elements that interfere with the game.
The driving model goes in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That means it's definitely no longer anyone in today's time, but it can't be said that it would be resistance.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But a more accurate race, the driving model here is still quite good, even though we could find better in competition.
Until then, everything's perfectly all right.
But problems start to emerge after a while.
Unlike the driving model, it's no longer a good model.
We don't expect this type of game to count complex deformations and collisions, but if you don't have the slightest idea how your car behaves, then it's probably not all right.
Typically, when you drive or change cars in normal operation, you will sometimes just easily slip each other, but otherwise, in almost identical situations, your car will end up in wild pirates.
Or even a straight-up.
Thanks to the restarting system, it doesn't matter at all, but it'll let you down safely.
The restarts are solved so that if you break up or go far outside the track, you will be put back to the last catch point on the track.
However, only five restarts are available in each race.
When you're exhausting them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a help in case you don't say anything than you could literally rely on them.
Sometimes, however, even restarts will not help, it will be necessary to learn to remember the race.
A big inhaled game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some loops are needed in a specific way, otherwise you will not be able to see them briefly.
You'll meet again in the "civil" location always in the same configuration as you get there first, fifth, five, five seconds before or a minute later.
This is especially so in situations where you see a rival between two anti-sight cars running easily before you, while when you get there, cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them or speed them up.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation is always right in front of your nose.
The rivals have another advantage.
During the game you will encounter several places where you will, no matter what time, always run the same rival in the same place.
Mostly it hits the end of the game on the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get in front of you, obviously, at any price.
If he's going in front of you, he's going to make it worse for you to see the anti-trafficking cars, so you're starting to get a lot more and more.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more intense and more adrenaline, but the realization is so clear that it will certainly destroy you quickly.
And it's too bad, because even through a simple driving model is playing fun and places and so much action that sometimes literally you don't try to watch where it's flying.
And it essentially doesn't matter whether he deserves a concept with fifty unique tracks, running races so that the boredom doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
A non-traditional idea is the exchange of cars during the race.
You have to pay attention to petrol pumps on the road, because you can change the car right there, even though in most cases you will have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sportsmen are suitable for urban areas, strong American boars on equal roads and exotic supersports on technical riding, for example on clicked mountain roads.
The main story mode goes hand in hand and mode of challenge, which are races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common to challenges and stories.
To obtain a higher level of drivers, different items are withdrawn: start cars and end with backgrounds for profile.
It is again connected to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and has another community function.
One of the other hard-to-understanding miners is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your vehicle you will reach the metro tunnel (be it) where you will marry in the darkness of your wheels (be it).
On the tachometer you look at the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (begin) and then the meter is attached to the back of it and you are uncompromisingly shaken.
In the editorial we're probably still having a discussion for a few days about whether nobody really thought about the game, or whether the authors really have such a big stupidity.
The technical page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It's so freezing that in some of the darkest moments, it reduces the imagery, and in some cases it's rather tragic.
But this is mainly the case with a larger number of participants, when your gas footage would no longer be valid.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a question of taste.
In an attempt to enjoy the widest scale of the younger audience, a soundtrack of the category "every other dog" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, the game will probably not be bought by anyone.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so dissipated.
If the game were to avoid entirely unnecessary errors, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
That's how the game works.
The fun is definitely fine, but be prepared to make mistakes to be blown into the eyes by the force of the airport reflectors.
The singing congregations of the UK will sound at the Student Summit concert
The association of the International Day of Study and Year of the Samet Revolution with the Music Experience offers the third festival of Fest Academy.
During this time, he is represented in twenty high school and high school singing congregations.
The main focus of the festival is two concerts held on 17 November.
"University of Karlo has a big share in the festival."
"Among the participating congregations, the Pévecké cór Pédagogique Facultí and the Faculty of Humanitarian Studies, the director of Václav Hampl, chaired the festival committee," said the leader of the organisation team, Jakub Čaloun.
The summit of the entire festival is a freely accessible public concert of the high school congregations, which will take place on 17 November from 14 hours on the screen in front of the National Technical Library in Djvic.
On the program is a composition of a significant Czech jazzman Karl Rozicky Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evenings, the concert "Students of the Summit" will be held at the National House of Vinohradach, where high school congregations will be held, including the singing congregations of the University of Karlova.
Festa Academy aims not only to celebrate the International Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Samet Revolution, but also to present the public of the congregation music at the highest level and to develop creative cooperation of young people.
The main speaker is the Union of Czech singing congregations in cooperation with the Gymnasium Jan Kepler.
Over the course of the action, the Prime Minister of the capital of Prague Bohuslav Voboda and the Rector of Karlov Václav Hampl took over.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The harmonogram also offers a whole series of concerts, student jumping, mornings and other shows.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festacacademica.cz
Velvyslandy at EU Vicen:
Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly disrupted the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little settled, calmed, and all the players will get used to their new roles," the Czech Embassy at the European Union Milena Vicenová began her second lecture at the Faculty of Law.
Since it takes its motto "Sensibly and openly about Europe" seriously, it has already shown in the first part of the lecture when it has been able to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a transparent and understandable way that a number of UK Law Department lecturers could envy it.
The Vice-President also welcomed the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuye:
"There has been a criticism before that it is not significant that it is a gray official that can't play any role, and I have to say that everyone has had a breath that the role has been excellent."
"It is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them perfectly and has a clear vision where the European Union should go."
The new high-level post for foreign affairs and security policy then explained in answer to the question, "Who is this European Union? What phone number should I call?", that is, a significant step towards the unification and greater readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
Nobody wants to stop us from the acid.
Vicenová has also dedicated herself to an agenda that the European Council has lived and will live as soon as possible.
The Czech Presidency has been a success.
The Czechs solved the current financial crisis, solved the gas crisis, or organised the summits for the Eastern Partnership.
The government's fall at this time marked a major negative that has hurt the Czech Republic very much.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very thorough.
It was said to be embellished, "the fact of framole" was not only a Presidency, but also a subsequent financial crisis that has been solved so far.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is making the current economic situation much more complicated.
Whether the budget will be modest and sustainable, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and less, this is all on the agenda for future negotiations.
She also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe Understandably".
"I really don't like ugly shorts, foreign words, a knife that no one understands.
How do the citizens understand that there are really no curved or round hooks in Brussels, bananas of various sizes, or that someone really has to ban us from acidic."
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the Embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who observe more negative than positive pages of things.
She also regrets the low representation of the Czechs in European institutions.
According to it, there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she then raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me that when Poland and Hungary come to me and the Slovak is approaching, then the French next to me will say, "Hey, what do you think of your Visegrad four?" and they're not excited about it at all.
In the future, according to the Vice-Presidents, new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States are mainly pending.
As a very real then, the concept of two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, is more than a new "European Federation."
"We have the eurozone and the country outside the eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only countries that wanted to cooperate and those that didn't want to be left behind."
"These institutions will be more and will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in the adoption of the principle that all issues affecting the Union as a whole should be discussed between all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Burn story:
Innovator IBM starts its second century of existence
If anyone were to look for a word that would be the most precise of IBM's strategy, it would probably be "longevity".
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company that has been in existence for a very modern time, and since its establishment has been a hundred years.
Based on this longevity, the company's first boss, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already reasoned that a number of world problems can easily be solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" became so printed that the life of the future giant will take place (and also the name of the internal magazine, which began to emerge in 1935 in IBM).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values, and yet she was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will be able to achieve even more," said the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano for the year.
Processed system
Watson, in his thirtieth years, came to care for his employees, like the company of Batá in Czech Republic - people from IBM had a paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a system designed to reward the best employees and traders.
The same process has long-term IBM and its relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, society has been brilliant in the exploitation of talents - as one of the first world companies has eliminated any discrimination, so she could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that the Palmisana in front of the IBM is setting up a woman - Virginia Rometti next year.
This in IBM has been acting for 30 years, still holds the position of sales, marketing and strategy chief.
In recent years IBM has made so-called jams, online brainstormings, which have created many future strategies and innovations.
It's not surprising that ideas are enough - it works in the company almost half a million people.
Good Name Institution
A firm position in the business ensures the firm's strong internal and external image.
"In the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just technology companies," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," George Colony of Forrester Research Consultant.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market evenly.
IBM - or "The Great Blue", as it is familiar with its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in hundreds of years.
It's probably the largest technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds the most patents from all American technology companies and five of her employees received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include banknotes, payment cards, financial swaps, line code or diskette.
IBM has become the second largest technology firm in the market capitalisation (first Apple) since its first appearance since 1996.
Front view
Not all products and innovations come in touch with customers and times - IBM for example did not bet on its own OS/2 operating system, on-line services Prodigy or IBM PCjr PCjr.
"If your business is on the move ahead, you can't get emotionally involved in the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, leave them.
Unlike a competitive Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective Technology
In the IBM markets, the largest share of services is, after about five is made of software and hardware.
In 1990, however, he was with more than half the strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold very little profitable assets worth $15 billion, while also investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
The investment continues since 2008, when the first world was overrun by the modern financial crisis.
IBM is one of his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who has also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis unaffected.
The price of IBM's shares has risen by 120 per cent since the beginning of 2008 and the company's net profit continues to grow.
The firm password IBM is to change everything, just not its values.
That's why it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will be able to handle it.
History IBM: From cheese cutters to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was created in New York a hundred years ago, originally had a complex name Computing Tableling Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken up until 1924 - it was originally a brand used for branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for IBM's subsequent merger was four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They own technology like the famous "pitches," which means hours of recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's Supervisory Board in 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson's head of competition to help him run the company.
The leader then exposed the founders of IBM - in Watson's thinking, an unbeatable corporate culture and identity has been built so far.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as indicated by its name, began with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from the tailors of meat and cheese after the store.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, he doubled his turnover to $9 million and began to expand the company’s expansion into all the world headquarters.
Watson was so inconvenient to the company that almost 40 years later, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, was beaten up in the boss’s chair.
Under his leadership IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly to space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous human flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pee" that became a computer standard at the time, called IBM 5150, came into the market in 1981.
About 20 years later IBM sold the Chinese computer production of Lenovo, on the contrary bought a consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to make full use of advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of smarter planets.
Its aim is to make wise use of technology in the area of unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example in urban transport or management.
Recently, IBM launched a Smarter Trade platform to help traders run the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history even in foreign countries.
She founded her branch in then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a research team at the world level dealing with the recognition of the vote.
A prospector for an unfaithful husband:
Iveto, get rid of that shit, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtāřová (53) said it's over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtār (53) became not only the protector of Ivety Bartoš (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
But now she's been waiting for the wrong time, and she's set clear rules for her next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explained the Writer.
When Darina Richtārová offered asylum to Bartoš in her home in summer, she probably didn't even know how her marriage would end.
Although Iveta moved away from the river after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted he loved her.
By the time Darina was remarried, her relationship with her husband had calmed down, and now she has even given him a good name.
The hunter doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If the Knight and Bartos were to break up just once, his wife would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will drive him away."
"But not as my beloved, mad old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Richtārová told her that she had already given up on her husband and lasted only for mutual obedience.
Joseph's being locked up by Darina's back door, so far it's okay.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I won't change it."
"The husband has arranged a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I'm taking care of repair, garden, real estate, buying."
"Darino and I are totally normal, except we don't share the beds together," said the White Knight.
If she also finds a new love, she won't be able to defend it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and took all my responsibility," Joseph closed.
The worst women's habits: Do they concern you too?
When you ask men if they could name some typical female abuses, they're all very soon to get out of hand.
Ladies and gentlemen, do you know in the following lines, where there are a number of women's abuses that can perfectly shed blood in the veins to men?
Shopping
Does your second half tell you that you're dependent on buying?
Do you have to buy yourself at least one hat a week?
Do you like buying and buying together in discounts?
Then, in your case, it's about buying as a crime.
Some women realize that they should have at least a little crush on their shopping passion.
But tell me, who would resist it just to walk through the clothes shops, look for good falling ends and then try them all (ideally in different color renderings) in the cabin?
Even though for most women shopping with horses, for men it can be literally a hell of a thing.
Just remember how many times you've told your friend that he'd rather wait for you before the entrance...
Unsatisfying Discontent
"Am I not too fat?"
"I should lose at least five kilos -- should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Don't those words remind you of anything?
Right?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their views.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more the women are upset.
Order and purity in first place
It's like an endless roundabout.
Cleans windows, drying, brushing the teeth, washing the dust, draining the bath - at least twice a week.
You're telling your partner that he was slamming his dirty leg on a clean tooth, the kids that they've slammed the drained washroom, and they're slamming down the damn living wall with which you've done so much work?
In case you're suffering from this "earth", try to realize that nothing should be moved and order and purity should definitely not be within the family first.
This unharmed desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationship and family comfort.
Rape
"Those used coaches throw in the trash."
"Will you get those old socks on you tomorrow too?"
"A wet blade doesn't belong on the ground."
If you mess with your partner like this a few times a day, you know you'll be able to pull him out safely.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, but you want to make it all right.
Maybe if the men knew it, the women wouldn't have had so much to do with it again...
Talking, jerking
For some women, they are also their own stories, jokes, but also insulting and collaborating with someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
I hope every one of us gets a little harmless rag or a curse out there.
Hands on your heart, it's your own for all women.
On the other hand, the vortexes of the worst grain, which are often vortexed, may be reversing and are particularly dangerous to everyone in their surroundings - mainly within the framework of the female working group.
Jagr and Voraček helped with Philly's victory assistance
The hockey attacker Jaromír Jagr participated in the Monday NHL's match with two assistances for the victory of Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolin's ice and is again in front of the productivity of the Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, a nine-year-old star, added another recording and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assistants in the match also recorded Jakub Voraček's partner.
The Jagr, after beating the marine journalists, claimed that he had predicted a big night for Giroux.
"I told him before the match he had a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes such a feeling will overtake you," explained Jagr, whose action gave Giroux a goal from the first shot of the Flyers.
A while later, he had a second strike of the Czech team.
The Voráček fought behind the Hurricanes cat and presented it between the circles of Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first stop was reduced in the weakening of the home player Patrick Dwyer, but the second part was again part of the Flyers.
In particular, Giroux.
After working with Jagrem, he shot a third goal, after which his shot crossed the race in the fourth branch of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely among the best three," Jagr evaluated his center.
"I would never think that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him."
"I'm happy to do that."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL my associates tried to play me, now it's turning," Jagr added.
Caroline from the fight still made a drama, the head of Tuoma Routu, and again Dwyer, who suffered from a criminal shooting, got the difference between one branch.
Another complication, however, did not allow Matt Read, who arranged for a number of two on one.
"He's got a good shot in our Proger band."
"He tipped the cat, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to a further point."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," he described the last band of matches from his point of view.
Philadelphia won the East Conference.
The Czech defender, Montreal Jaroslav Šprazek, did not win a fight against Buffal, in the second third he resigned for injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens, along with the experienced bee, also lost double-blind leadership and lost after the penalty shot 2:3.
One of their rides hasn't changed Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach more than the lost points hated the vast marodice of the rear row, with only five defenders playing the match.
"It's bad."
"We played the run with only one experienced player, the rest of us were young."
"But there's nothing to do with it soon, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We've been able to control it, and we've been unable to resist it."
"We should have simplified the game more, removed the crack from our band."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
The Czech barrister Andrzej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg attacks to 5:2 victory over Tampou Bay.
About the jets that broke down the five-track series, five different shooters were divided.
How arrival prices have developed since 1989
By 1989 only five state travel offices were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agents at the time sold only trips to the socialist bloc in the dry majority, since travel to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists thus traveled on a holiday to the sea to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Soci na Krym zu Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime joined the West and Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the times of socialism was that it was not possible for citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also for the Czech Slovaks) to travel freely on an individual basis even within the socialist countries.
In case the citizens of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, they needed a letter from that country, otherwise it was not an individual road possible.
Traveling offices at the time also offered trips to the West, but there was a need to stand the front over the night with a package or to have in the travel office "well known".
But it wasn't even saved.
The so-called foreign currency pledge, which was the condition for the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people", who could not even travel.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, without a foreign currency pledge, so it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) on the West road.
However, the Czechs spent their vacation abroad, which resulted in a great deal of chat and chalaps, which the Czechs have settled and this habit survives to this day.
Traveling the Czechs has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
As long as 1989 was allowed by our maximum in the NDR or Bulgaria, the summers spent Czechs abroad 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are not aware of today is that for us today, Croatia's most popular was not able to travel freely until 1989, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Toward the end of the 90th century, visa requirement was abolished in neighbouring Western European countries, starting with a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria or Germany.
The Czechs could not afford to travel to the West for a long time, and everyone wanted to see it for at least a minute.
For example, in Paris, the Czech hotels in the parking lots were burned, as our current incomes did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
The typical drawing of the Czech travel was at this time the driving of its own food, cans, salads, etc. to save it.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely interchangeable Czech crowns, which our tourists could finally buy the western currency for many decades.
However, our standard of living and the average payments have risen, which has been spent around 1997 at the next important moment.
As a result of the increased demand for travel, travel officials have regularly started preparing flights with charter airlines since 1997, with the possibility to negotiate multiple discounts in comparison with the past.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs had already had a non-violence contact in practically all the developed countries of the world, except for the United States, which further made our travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of evolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when due to a significant demand from the Czech Republic, the first direct charter flight to exoticity was made to Thailand.
From this year on, every year Czech tourists fly direct charters to warm distant countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting about 100 thousand Czechs annually!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished a visa for Czech tourists and thus definitely made our countries one of the most prosperous countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their foreign vacations (50.3%) and the first in history spent one foreign vacation including the cost of staying more than 15,000 CZK per person.
The Valna gathering has to find the president, but again threatens the pat
The Czech football is almost five months away without the president and threatens that the successor, Ivan Haška, in front of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), will not even be known after another extraordinary event that will take place Thursday in Nymburg.
There is still no agreement to be followed by the electoral order.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest of leading Czech football is Jindrich Rachel, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June and, at his departure, called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead to football in the future.
However, in an era after Haskova, the football team turned back on the track between the two federal chambers, which could not match on the joint candidate.
It was fully demonstrated on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates gathered at the National House in Prague on Smíchos in vain because the discussion was blocked and not just about the way of the election.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the assembly - whether only statutory representatives or officials of authority.
At this only point, since then, a partial agreement has been established, which has also helped in the recommendation of the Constitution for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
But there's still a lot of spores about the electoral order.
Nor did the executive committee make the situation too clear, which, on its own, does not deal with anything else, whether it is right or not.
The view of the option of election has changed several times, but the neurological point is still the same.
The question is, how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of paternity?
"The dispute is whether to act in accordance with the terms or to find another model," noted one of the three FAČR Vice Presidents Dušan Freedom, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
According to the terms of the proposed model, in the third round, the candidate wins, which will have higher percentage support in the chamber than he will apply for.
It is supposed to be willing to go to the election in order to win a candidate who receives a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the weight of the gain in this percentage calculation.
"But then it would lose the meaning of the two previous rounds, it would completely contradict the two-wheel concept," grasps the opposition of the Moravian Party of Freedom, according to which it would be best not to move and vote according to the current states.
With this, too, Tomáš Paclík agrees, although it is estimated that the rulings have the highest number of candidates in Pelt.
"I wish it would go as far as I can."
"In order not to think of any reprehensible nonsense as in the previous wave assembly," said the owner Victoria Plzeň, who was first candidate and in his statements he was primarily opposed to Pelt.
Pelta remains an optimist.
In Nymburce, according to him, the new president will know and believe that candidates will work constructively in the future.
"All will eagerly calm down the possible process of today's national team on the European Championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, it will be more willing to cooperate," says the apple artist, who has three of the greatest experiences with football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more persistent.
"I hope the deal, but unfortunately the situation is very disillusioned."
"It's not between the Czech and Moravia people, but there are efforts to adapt to the rules."
"This can cause the blockage of the Vale collection to come again."
"But I hope he wins a healthy mind," said Rachel.
There's no time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some of the talks were supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, but who is to say that the football generality will be complete in the fight.
The flight special in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among other things, the Vice-Chairman of Dalibor Kučera and Reichl, because of the technical break in Prague, did not fly in the morning and sought a replacement option as part of the executive committee's transport to the resort.
Finally, it may be a decision-making meeting at the ministerial level, which may be expected to take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Body Josef Dobeš would like to get the disbanded parties inside the country's strongest sports association to agree.
There is a lot of this in the game: state grants, football confidentiality and also a Valuable Collection of ČSTV, which will address new direction of Czech sport on the financial problems of the Sazka.
The hell's going to fight for the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the leader of the footballers Plzno Tomáš Paklík saw a strong candidate in front of an extraordinary wave gathering, who would fulfill all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) and would not join in the fight for the ultimate function.
"If there was a quality adept, I'd fight for it and I wouldn't make a choice."
"But in the present situation, no one has succeeded in finding such a person," said the CHK Paclík.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelt and Jindřich Rachel's wife Paklík's motivation to try to stop Pelt, the alleged favorite of the election, in front of the FAČR.
The Pact also stresses that in the event of its victory, it would only take place in 2013 as the President, when a proper valid assembly is on the agenda.
In this function, he would like to see an experienced and peak manager who is not too involved with football.
"I spoke to some people who would come to mind."
"It was crazy for me when some people said they didn't even want to identify with the Czech football right now."
"That's what I'd like to change," he said.
Paklíkovi is now the leader of the most important connection between Pelt and the president of the Plzeńska Regional Football Association Roman Berbre, a man with controversial stories, who is known in the background as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the votes of the delegates on the plain assembly.
It's so unacceptable for Paklíka that Pelta is in the presidential position.
"If he wins, the current state is preserved and nothing in the football will move forward."
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a capable businessman, it would not have worked more on football," said Paclík.
They also insist that Pelt's name was recorded in the envoys during the investigation of the corruption affair, but Pelta left without a penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paklík, who is also taking over his earlier sentence that he would "sold a plenary club if Pelta became president".
If Paklík triumphed in the Thursday election, he would be able to present his future cooperation with Pelt.
He also takes into account another Rachel candidate, whom Paclík supported in front of the September rally, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"I have great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the representation."
"But management would not be able to drive an association."
"I don't have a nose where I can't," said Paclík, who in September aroused great attention by standing behind the appeal of the committee of judges in front of Human Macel, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Hell claims he'd run an association troufl.
He refers to his ability to run private companies, and since last year he has also led the Plzens, who, with his support in May, celebrated the Prime Minister's league triumph.
"I have the power to change anything in the football environment to contribute to its specific cultivation."
"To limit the impact of some interest groups, which may have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and recalling commission, which goes to unpleasant situations," said Paklík, who is not hiding their antipathy, for example, to the chief of the Spartans, Daniel Kretínski.
One of the priorities would also be to consider the strengthening of FAČR relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which the political summits would use to lobby for more money from lottery tax to sport.
"It's one of the key things the new president should do."
"If gambling happens, as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but at the same time they have to say where the money goes," he noted.
As a pity now, Paclík does not even accept his connection to the Plzena Club, as he claims himself that the President of the FAČR should be "on the side".
Pelta is connected to the Jablon, Rachel to the Prague Dock.
"It's not perfect."
"But I can't see the point of converting my shares to someone in the Pulsan Club, and for a year and a half, he came back there," said Paklík.
Pelta promised new FAČR states that would exclude the election path
Two days before the Valuable Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the event of the election, it would be a rule for the FAČR to have new positions that would definitely rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jabloneck official is an optimist before Thursday's talk in Nymburg and believes that the pre-election struggle is a significant factor in the possible success of the football performance today.
Pelta had already promised before the September election that it would focus on representation and the acquisition of finance in the event of the election.
In the election before the last wave gathering, he decided to go for the last minute, and then a two-month delay could be made so that he could defend and represent his ideas about football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the president to know on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the best time for an association to lead," says a man who is primarily associated with an apple club, but who has been active in Sparta for a number of years and an executive committee of the bond.
That's why he thinks he has enough experience to drive the Czech football.
He is convinced that the current election problems are euphoria, which dominated the reign of Ivan Haska.
"Unfortunately, at the red wave assembly, opinions were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If different interpretations were not allowed, we had the president since September," Pelta warned.
The process of recasting the most important document of the civil society has been described as a tool for delegates.
"If I become the president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to assume personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a basic thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He's still trying not to get out against his rivals.
He had previously warned that he could present himself with Jindřich Rachel, who he recognized for his legal education, and well knows that his opponent would be his first vice president.
He hasn't even attacked Tomás Paclík for a long time, and he didn't leave a dry spot on Pelt.
"Something's going on in football over the year, has already made some progress."
"But his attacks were invincible, and many people were shocked by the election campaign."
"That's why a number of them now doubt his true character," said Pelt's opponent, who is still faithful to the proclamation he announced in September.
According to him, his most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions until after the representation.
That should be a football graduation.
"And I would also try to put an end to all the affairs of the cause of the Bohemians or the sounds of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then go to the private and state sector to ensure that we have enough money for the whole football," the CHK said, a 16-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his coming to the front of the football would mean no personal cleaning.
"I should first get to know the full number of employees," said Fearov, where a long-term government is ruled by understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are taking place at the Vale Assembly, they believe that on Thursday they will not go to Nymburk for the rest of the day.
"If it's the only controversial point of how to vote in the third round, then we can move through it."
"Football needs confidentiality, and here it only gets by finally having its leader again," Pelta stays two days before maybe deciding on the day of her functional career as an optimist.
Rachel promises that FAČR would start working hard under it.
If the new president of the Czech Republic's Football Association had been elected to the fourth round of elections, today's Vice-President Jindřich Reichl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rachel, in fact, promises to start working hard in his election.
He wants to propose system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the cause of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue in the work initiated by previous President Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I would like to dedicate my football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'd do everything myself," Rachel said in a conversation for the CTC.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competence within the executive committee so that each member will be dedicated to certain areas."
"And I'm going to give a hard task to move the football on a mile forward in each of these segments."
"Many people would probably not be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he thought he wouldn't run again.
"I'm known to be doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will always throw their fists under my feet and question every step of my life," he explained.
"Many people told me I couldn't give up because then they would give up."
"It's a trust I can't just throw," he said.
It also motivates him to continue in the work he started with Haske.
"In those two years a big piece of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it now."
"There are ongoing processes that will be heard within a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with concern that in the case of another candidate Miroslav Pelty's election, the situation on the link could be restored to the time before the Haske.
"I believe in systematicism, and that's something that I don't think Mirek Pelt can."
"He's the most bound of the people who would make football so he'd be just for the chosen ones."
"I can count on a lot of things, but it's certainly not that of someone else."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then they'll all be well and not just your election," Rachel noted.
He's throwing and claiming he'd only be the Czech president.
"Even though some people are trying to argue otherwise, I plan to make the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into a Czech and Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would be no current situation where only three Moravian totals are in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rachel.
Since the leader of the Pulsan Club Tomáš Paclík joined in the fight, Rachel won't be able to estimate her chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its vice president and sees that I have clear successes," said Rachel, who considers the saving of tens of millions of crowns in unfavourable contracts, the negotiation of television contracts and the negotiation of the lottery law.
On the contrary, he thinks that the bond doesn't pull into one line.
While Pelt states that he is "disqualified from returning Czech football to confidence", the second of Paklíka's competitors is considered a strong candidate who has what to offer football.
"No one can doubt he's done a great job in plenary this year."
"If he had been elected, he would have continued in the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not have changed his personal position in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to do it for his own good," Rachel's evaluation of the rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
From the view of Ufona, the shopping pool in Budapest: Who travels Europe can enjoy his blue miracle - and after a tour of the city or travel let his tired feet rest in thermal spas.
The book shows where wellness is at the water's most beautiful.
When Iris Meder was released in the past one and a half years on the open road, she should not have been missing in her pocket: her swimsuits.
Standing on the water, she looked up to the height of the artistic pools, swam across the marble road (a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored secession vessels.
If she was liked by a sailor, she was taken to her mother - with remarkable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 sailors have examined the historical architecture of Meder in this way and are now presented in their recently published book "Badefreuden": People's swimming pools in Munich, the historical palace of the swimming pool in Schwarzwald, "Turdy core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The path to the most unusual spas in Central Europe": near Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited localities in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a truly enthusiastic marine culture.
With sport it doesn't go too far, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
The relationship is that fan swimming must be satisfied with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while healthy runners can breathe the humid smell of smear forests or listen to the happy glowing of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the sailboats must always be so expensive," says Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"That's how I started to collect nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Blowing in the ski pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of relaxation is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the sailors could be the real bait for the eyes: "The place of the floor is man's in the salt water."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: high clenba, pestrels, poppy peach.
Maloformat image "Badfreuden" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis wellnes - but especially the taste of jumping into the blue.
The remarkable specimens discovered Mrs. Meder's sailor during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing spas, as 100 years of old Szechenyi spas in Budapest, she found water with the contents of the vacuums in the original beautiful cave (a beautiful spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the thermal spas whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are placed in the shape of a bottle (Városios Termálfürdö in Jászberén).
A beautiful view across the city offers many heated sailors under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. While a person has from the Curasian emergency bath in the eyes of the city, the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton can be seen on snow covered by Arlberg - and: In pairs of swimming pools there is a window from which it is possible to watch the movement of the ski resort.
The most remarkable design of the swimming pool is expected by the guests in Langenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From the top of the three open lords in the winter, a couple will rise, while in the background of the Ötztal mountain lies to the sky.
Alhambra and Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool collector, Mrs. Meder pach chlor in the chrysus.
Many thermal spas are smelling after cheese, in the spas of Arpád in Hungary’s Békessaba, it smells like hot oil to the extent that a person hardly believes that he has reached the treatment spas.
Zapach comes from therapeutic water with alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and its ingredients are glued to the skin as soon as one enters the pool - some special experience of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and air-conditioning spa Luhačovici, she came to the closed area.
In 1902 the architect Dušan Jurkovic designed bathrooms were closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the breaking windows of the red-white-yellow sessional buildings, she saw how the splendour between the tiles could grow.
In contrast, the sun was built in a magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald, Palais Thermal, Bad Wildbad.
These bathrooms already have three stages of construction; one can discover not only novel elements that originate from the time of their creation in 1844, but also a maurice shade in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favorite spa resort of Mrs. Iris Meder's swimming pools, and it's not just because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some power, connecting so many building structures to such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
In such a palace, submerged into the thermal pool is probably a coastal matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check the trade with the comets
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to the information SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the group's boss wants to draw the results out.
Hamburg -
It is clear to the public that 84% of the Germans, according to one study, are unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials like wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions come out of this trade because the problems of the poorest world are deepening.
This is the result of the Forsa survey from the mandate of the Foodwatch Consumer Organisation.
The study is based on the report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity exchanges have high prices and therefore banks have a global hunger problem.
Consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Chief Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although also large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, comet bets were meant to ensure that traders were against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, most experts agree that participants in the capital market were interested in high-risk trades and were driven away from supply and demand - and profit from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he reacted to Ackermann's criticism: He promised that the extracts would check and said that no trade "is worth a good reputation for Deutsche Bank in bet".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Foodwatch-Report Task Force controls.
By the end of the year, the check will be closed and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank - together with the recommendation on how to load it.
At the end of January, the representatives of the bank will then report on the consequences.
At the end, there could be a reduction in trade in comets or even complete rejection.
Ackermann works self-help on his image.
The Head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: "The rise in food prices is particularly drastic, as the bank today is harming the general welfare."
Let Ackermann, as the top bank lobbyist, be given responsibilities.
"Deutsche Bank needs to narrow down from its portfolio all the items in which money is used for food price bets," Bode said.
"I wonder if Mr. Ackermann is hungry for suffering people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears at first glance as a surprise, but it is clear that the Group Manager would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he leaves the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not go to the Supervisory Board otherwise than planned.
By turning away from the controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he does not have to worry about the possible loss - he should finally advise his successor.
Anyone else would say investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have been involved in the organisation campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which 1001 people were questioned by the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November.
According to this, it is only 11 per cent that Deutsche Bank is offering investments that are linked to food prices.
Many bank customers would also benefit from personal consequences if they learned that their bank is engaged in such transactions: Everyone else would, as a result of the survey, report on all investments in which money flows into the speculation of raw materials.
43 per cent would warn a known bank, 49 per cent stated that they were thinking about reporting their account and moving to another institution.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The history of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prices, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
When it stands for modern military architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new construction materials typical of the faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an outstanding and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and exciting steel and glass construction.
The building is still a milestone of the current architecture.
He praised the architect so that he built the pavilion of Austria for the next world show.
At the end of 1973, with its legendary four-storey BMW-fired plus as a key to the side building in Munich, it was internationally celebrated.
His temporary exhibition building, which was designed after the world exhibition, was built at Schweizer Garten at the Viennese Südbahnhof (South Station), rebuilt and opened the Museum of the 20th century in 1962 - it was named the "House of the 20th Century".
But suitable for the museum building was not, either spatially or technically, missing walls to hang artistic exhibits, no good weather.
However, it was used until the current art reached Vienna's new station.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been chatting more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilon has rebuilt, now bearing the name "The House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Modern Art.
On Tuesday evening there will open the Museum Belvedere, the first exhibition of which is the palace - a happy goal in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco took place, which in 2007 became the new director of the Belvedere Museum of Austria.
Husslein-Arco, a popular historical art with a significant career, including in the young tailor-made, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's Museum, and as the founder of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, has undergone a significant reconstruction of policies and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship and determined the use.
In addition to the current art, the work of the associate Fritz Wotruba should be displayed with the same hope, coffee and bookstores should be created, and an office building should be built to do so.
Close surveillance, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was the ideal siege.
Not only that he was sensitively reconstructed and expanded the sequential buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but because at Schwanzer he studied at the Technical University of Vienna and Pavilion was for him "an extremely important place", where he looked at the exhibition "most every weekend".
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which, when moving to Vienna, had already lost its beauty and ease of use.
At the present reconstruction there were far more problems: the building was "a catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the glass facades were replaced, used by glass fibers, the glass insulation glass and the glass roof were replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold steel bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were restored.
Two underground floors have provided a place for new use, the abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, the entrance leads to the bridge - almost a new building, but still an excellent Schanser pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is decorated in an old anti-corrosion red tones.
And the movie is even the same as it used to be.
And it's all under the strict supervision of the memory office and the low budget.
"Many times it had to be found material that was good and cheap and also liked the memory office," Krischanitz says and points to the breaking of the basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems, and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult to say that it was with the pavilion "who came here from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "be appropriate self-conscious".
In this case, however, the 21st-century House is not in the wrong place, because the urbanist happy coincidence has occurred: In the area around Schweizer Garten, the newly designed "City District at the Main Station" is created with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there is another happy coincidence: The house of the 21st century could receive support from the other Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunshalle and, as you can hear it, already has one with the city of the neighborhood in the resort of Schweizer Garten.
Road is planning a package for the winter crisis in the millions
The road has been drained by a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the winter of train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn publishes more than 70 million euros in the news this year.
The "Bild" news submitted a preliminary report with a call for an internal group plan, which is estimated to be totaled by 2015 with investments of around EUR 300 million.
It is intended to achieve better use of trains and rail networks under extreme wind conditions as well.
It is planned, inter alia, to double the number of internal and external employees per 16,000 people to remove snow on railway installations and railway stations.
The aim is to remove the starting point for the operation and 90% for the operation of the necessary displacements during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Dr. Rüdiger Grube warned at the highest level of the meeting with the government and industry before train accidents and delays during the winter.
In the last winter, there were significant problems in personal transport because, among other things, there was a lack of reserve under difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Spolko Railway Authority.
In addition, delays in ICE train transport
The route has not been able to do so over the years, and it is likely that ICE trains will have to be monitored more frequently when a train arrived at ICE on Cologne’s main station to destroy the repair.
Deutsche Bank pays a million bucks in the United States
After a break around Chief Joseph Ackermann, there is a new hitchhiking in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, it was still in the field of his past in the USA: the Frankfurt institution is paying a balance of $145 million (106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of the five major social banks in the course of the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgages.
The financial market regulator of NCUA counts a number of large banks, that the corporate banks have made false promises to buy financial products; that the risks are likely to be reduced.
Such papers were lost during the crisis significantly at the value and thrown the banks into ruin with them.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the issue without the need for parties to draw to court," spokesperson Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt when it's settled.
It also applies to Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the presence of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for corporate banks in the United States and helps with bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get a refund for the resulting billions of damage.
Now the final equations are the first of their kind.
The regulator also relied on other large banks, and in summer he complained about JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the questionable mortgage notes it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American bubble collapsed around the real estate in 2007, it became a number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Even though the incident occurred a few years ago, the strong winds are now blowing in the mouths of banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed a number of complaints in order to achieve corrections or raise doubts.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) dropped the largest wave of complaints.
It seems to the 18 international banks that two state-owned financiers dealing with the properties of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions amounting to about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA complaint, which deals with more than $14.2 billion in total from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without stating an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffet enters IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffet invests potentially in the IT sub-unit IBM.
Since March, he has bought a stock worth more than $10 billion.
So far, a significant American investor Warren Buffett has always declared that it will not invest in IT and computers, as long-term development by companies is only expected to be difficult to predict.
However, he has now read IBM's commercial reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand before that IBM was offering services in particular and has computer systems for the IT department of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is set to fit the knight.
As a result, it is now known as the mother's horn of IT IBM "Sir IBM".
Because Buffet has made it available at the CNBC's American economic ad-hoc station that from March he has purchased an IBM stock of $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about his engagement yet.
He praised the management he was trying to achieve even the right results for the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
For a long time, IBM has been investing in luxurious IT services such as the operation of computing centres.
More than 100-year-old computer developer also offers software and advice and executive computers for companies.
Buffet with technology companies has been more avoided by today.
He claims to invest only in enterprises whose activities are also understood.
Instead, Buffet was laid by the freight station, by the manufacturer of the masz or by the manufacturer of machinery.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 own subsidiaries also shared in a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Recht.
Mr. 81-year-old took over a small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
That's why it's for many investors all over the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of making money brought him the nickname "Omaha's Orakel (Omaha's Miracle).
When Buffett's investment became known, the share of IBM stopped before the start of the stock exchange by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of over $220 billion in stock and is set up with Apple and Microsoft for the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to perform.
Founder Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
The risk is material
After the discovery of the "Bunów in Zwickau" Turkish media are questioning the German rule of law.
The news even speaks of "blood ideology", which now lives again.
The killings of eight small Turkish-born entrepreneurs and one Greek in 2000 to 2006 had a legally extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, fear and anxiety were affected by this report.
For many of the Germans, the threat that has long been put to death has returned: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable violence with the right extremist background.
There was no doubt that there was an xenophobic in Germany.
However, the judicial extremist network appears to reveal the extent to which the dimension cannot be observed long ago.
"Is he revitalizing blood ideology?" the headlines of the internet release of Turkish news "Haberturk".
On the contrary, the news "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators should be a secret police officer for the protection of the constitution and fears that German authorities could also be involved in the right radical base.
The Turkish community of Germany responded with a severe response: It recalled the weekend demonstration of silence in front of the Brandeburg dam of victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policies, recalled the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In happy colors, a common life was staged - like a history of success.
As a box here, several Turkish media reports: "Dear Germany to the '50s" is the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of "Hürriyet" for Germany does not allow itself to be taken into account so as not to make this connection.
"It's starting to smell," sounds the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
It stresses that people who paid taxes and contributed to the restoration of Germany were murdered.
The most critical is the procedure of the police in German internet forums and its late success in the search.
Why did not the German authorities come up long ago to admire the authors after suspected patrols in the right extremist circles?
Thus many are held at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity continues to be carried out so superficially, the immigrants will have nothing but their own defence and arms."
"It's probably the best self-defense."
"The quality of the explanation and suitability of the entire network depends very heavily on domestic peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
Which means, if domestic peace is threatened in Germany, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burning place in Solingen is deeply into the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has shown to the Turks living here more clearly that there is a material threat and to the Germans that mistrust and deviation can lead to legal violence
However, the assassinations made Turkey's side more sensitive to each other's feelings.
Do not repeat the past mistakes
The Turkish press then criticised the failure of Germany's policy of assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those who survived in Mölln.
After the burning attack in Solingen, he sent a compulsive telegram to the Turkish President, but he was allowed to represent his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what charges were paid by the Turks.
It's like a person's value is measured according to the height of his taxes.
The current news of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is in the present state-law arrangement.
In addition to the effort to clarify and reassess the right of extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Scandal Bank at the Curyška Lake
The most favourable bank of Europe has no residence in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered almost bankruptcy as a financial crisis and from then on from one crisis to another.
Now a German has to compare it.
Then Axel Weber certainly didn't mean it.
Following his sound departure from the head of the Spolk Bank, it became known in July that 2013 will take place in almost the same spectacular new job: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber was happy, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new strength and said friendly notes to future colleagues.
"Die UBS reached the scene."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was clear in September that everything would be completely different.
One dealer from UBS in London visited all the bank's security systems and lost approximately 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Head of Mission Oswald Grübel, not only a recognised banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the UBS Board has been as moderate as possible - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has become known that the Weber bank has been allowed to work since February 2012.
And the Presidency will take over the Governing Council in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be hard.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he'd definitely need time to work.
We will then assume responsibility for the Bank's strategy, which has once again proved that it deserves the title "Bank of Europe's biggest scandals"
However, the UBS is huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager - and almost every year from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, will remain the proud Swiss bank saved.
It started as a financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also of the smart owner of the property is combined with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in the investment banking industry.
Thus, UBS adjusted 2007 on one side with $1.6 billion more money on behalf of its clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it's as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
It made sense.
The former banker and later long-term professor of banking in Zurich Hans Geiger will tell: "I always told my students back then UBS as a good bank model."
"From today's point of view, man asks, "How could I have been wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first obvious that something in the UBS had happened properly.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli's head of representation, who has so far been appointed as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker, was surprised.
A few months later, he was wondering why he left.
The investment division of the bank has stirred subprime-papers and had to save billions.
To stop it, the UBS announced an increase in capital of real 13 billion francs.
This is why it is true that investors have been found, of course, which would have been more than recently covered by the nose: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that no one even knew its name.
But it was just the first shot.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to admit the new billions of losses, the president of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS became aware of its misinvestments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank has recovered from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for a mandatory variable bond for which it could become a co-founder of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has so large banks in its territory.
Finally, the 2007 UBS balance sheet was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We couldn't save UBS once again," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is the second one.
For several months now, UBS has been capitalizing on tax disputes with America and has shown a willingness to issue data from customers who, as far as possible, have been taxed with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return on unauthorized profits from these transactions, including bribes.
The UBS found itself more or less open that it helped to reduce tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that had been the life of her capital in the competition for rich customers: a saint of discretion.
After this scandal, there was no more Swiss banking secrets than before.
The chairman's resignation and the President of the Board of Directors followed.
And the exodus of customers' money.
The bank thus lost its credibility over the course of several months in both central trading areas: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in the management of the property to help tax fraud.
And just when it calmed down again, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, this unfortunate commercial anabasm came in here: the only dealer lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it's clear: with risk management in investment banking, it probably still doesn't fit.
"The Adodol case has probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economist and Financial Professor of Finance at the Zürich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The UBS problem is that it does not manage risk control."
However, that was exactly the idea of the caution that Swiss bankers have advanced long ago to become the observers of the world's big assets: no too high a risk, so the security for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic has increased the world again.
Swiss banks’ vaults have become a symbol of unbreakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is even more suitable for the good Swiss private banks - it's just a little bigger.
It's already a classic place.
The bank has its main seat in the Kurdish Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curyš Lake, which is framed by snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rentals of shops are the highest in Europe.
Clothing like Tiffany's is found here among Swiss traditional shops like the Sprüngli sugarcane.
There are Swiss banks, from the Nationalbank through the Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private bank as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered by heavy turning doors.
Inside there are walls covered with marble, there are possible leather chairs facing them, next to the bank's log, a big direction to "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank, however, has sometimes been suppressed or betrayed by the head of one small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not read in the newspapers, eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, as well as both large banks.
UBS is likely to have increased too much, finding out - especially in the investment banking industry, where the Anglo-Saxon people have also expanded.
The Swiss probably don't have anything to say about it.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to English ways long ago."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking that changed the UBS, led to its first high profit and then a loss: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
October 15, 2008 was a disaster.
"On Wednesday, the government coalitions of the small seven million countries settled on the greatest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
As many as 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros have been approved by politicians to protect against bankruptcy by the large bank.
How could that happen?
If they talk to Swiss bankers, they see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined a powerful group.
A bank which was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it continued to grow.
However, it helped to complement both different bank predecessors of UBS: One rich but sleeping bank in Zurich with a sense of wealth and poorer management, but internationally more strongly involved.
Here, internationalised investment bankers have come in favour of a lot of money that they could solve a big roulette.
In addition, two names have been added: Peter Wuffli, Head of the UBS and Marcel Opel Group, then Chairman of the Board of Directors, from 2001 to 2007.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Opel were a team of futures," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Opel, a man who is driving his feelings around the stomach that has been developed from banking science up there."
But Opel's been relying on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably finally allowed the decisive errors: "I suppose he thought his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear, the phoenix has gone down.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of the leading employees, on which the group leader Wuffli repeated the same password all the time: Hit Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
"League Tables," a series that documents the success of the bank of the time.
She was trying to get UBS up there.
A few steps have already happened to her.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, the games were fully involved.
However, business advisors who were entrusted stress one weakness: In international interest trading, in bankers' talk "Fixed Income", there is probably a big gap behind the largest banks.
UBS has some gaps in US mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, the UBS decided on an adventure that had almost become its existence.
Hungered by growth, both the bank itself and its fund-based to ensure the risk to US investments of Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that converted valuable papers into American mortgage loans and passed on - but it also kept itself at risk.
Even when the other banks were looking for the east.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it," says bank expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, so deep down.
One manager had to leave after the other when the cleaning attempts were harder than they thought.
UBS positions have become a catapult seat and to this day they collapse.
Who's leading the big bank now has almost impossible work.
They have to find a strategy for a bank that all close business models have gone missing.
Banking expert Geiger already has the idea: End of investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't even want to go that far.
But investment banking is going to kill so hard, so clear now.
Next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italy was understood as only a transient solution when the bank suddenly broke up with the former Grubel.
In the meantime: He has a long time to run UBS shops, has announced the Curish bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state in the mid-1990s.
3500 spots of dirt.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a visa.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money for?
These are questions that Axel Weber is already asking.
In public, however, she's only saying that she's gonna find her lady in front of her apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

"We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe is probably not so quick about the recession, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The legend of Warren Buffett's investment only confirmed this view: In one CNBC interview, he said it would probably not be clear if Europe was strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That's why it's probably too early to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the old principle for decades and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM increased the share rate of the traditional group and left it against the trend in trading at first counting almost one percent higher.

Smart crows expand in cities
In many places the harrans are laid full for "problem birds": However, from the city long ago, these highly intelligent animals cannot be sprayed, claimed experts.
One of them likes them, friends would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The gates are already part of the city’s image for centuries, yet in some communities there are complaints about uncleanness and noise caused by animals.
So far, there is no way against the "problem birds" in surveillance.
The Havranes are probably not able to get out of town anymore, the experts declared on the first symposium of the crows in East African Leer.
There, experts from all over the community consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
The conservationists also removed the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected farmland: The use of chemicals in agriculture is likely to destroy the traditional areas for life to an increasing extent.
Tracking, growing construction and planting typical trees for nesting birds make life difficult.
The gates are protected.
A large colony with more than 600 nesting couples are, among others, in the Westphalia Soestus, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Brem and Leer.
There, 2005 triggered a controversial mass murder project of a negative title in the rural period.
Critics have marked the capture of the animals into the pastures for birds and killing the claws, especially brutal.
"Normal expulsion, fear, nothing brings," found so many urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer.
The removal of nests by cutting water or planting trees often has undesirable consequences, said also environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are retreating, the great colony is crawling and splitting into other places."
Fear is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, pensioners or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get away with them."
Without the surrounding area, the city cannot be solved, it was the opinion of ancient Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is thought that the combination of animal removals from sensitive residential areas and their attractation to settle elsewhere.
"The information table instead of chain-pillars" advocated against this psychologist and ethnoologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment of animals: "One bite in the face can at last be the best thing we can stop by ourselves."
In Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg, Mrs Jürgens co-founded a scientific path that provides an information table on the life of a highly intelligent full-fledged shark.
The project is in the meantime to accept tourists.
Also at the criticism of the noise of the birds, Mrs Jürgens had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Havrani fills not only with help to reach Pamlska, but even as a help, he will make his tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the behavior of the four full - eyed sharks as far as bird intelligence is concerned.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that stones must bring the creation of the structure to the larvae.
Without a big training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to make the plane collapse.
In the second attempt, anointed crows had to solve a more delicate problem.
In the slums of the war, the researchers placed a small specimen with a larval mollusk.
They couldn't get the birds to their advantage.
Of course, the researchers put a piece of the wire in there.
All four of them made a hook, which was used as a suction catch from the seams of the seams.
Three of the four full-fledged fences even made it with a stake.

Jiracek scored for Czech Republic
Finally, he stood in the center of the judgmental Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
After the move against Helder Postig in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbeho and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36).
On the contrary, Stark carried out a controversial criminal set after Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic certainly changed.
But after the break, the European Vice-President of 2004 explained everything with four trephams.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in 81 minutes.
This leaves Europe's champion from 1976 to the fifth in line to the European Championship.

The branch, shortly before the end, finally explained everything.
At the time, Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul did not exceed Turkey in Zagreb status 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to release his third place in the 2002 World Championships, Croatia must be pleased with its fourth participation in the final round of the European Championships.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, Turkey should experience almost a historic start.
Selcuk Ian Trefil in the seventh minute shot from a distance just a stick, attacker Kazim could not also hang a reflected ball in the Branse.
After this terrible second, Croatia was taking over, but still more control.
They also didn't get the Croat White after the break.

Massacre at personal level
Emotionally strong new book by Peter Englunda, entitled Beauty and Condolences: The True History of First World Wars (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of emerging characters as you get stuck in it.
One advice on how to behave at this time: Carefully remove this page and make a deposit from it.
With all the people, you will get to know Mr. Englunda very well and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a Mayak - at times when you will feel as much confusion and loss in different situations as men and women in the story.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also a new job at the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite politely, as "antihistoric work".
It contains a number of well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, but it is almost lacking in ambassadors, energy journalists and discussions on tactics and equipment.
It's not even the book about what happened, explains the author, as well as "the book about what it was like." It deals mainly with " feelings, perceptions, experiences and moods".
"Beautiful and Enormous" combines the war experience of 20 more less Tuttic men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to horolozc, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, end up crazy, or die.
Their lives smell like flames of candles burning in the church - new ones add to the coincidence of fate while others turn away.
Mr. Engunda's book is different from classical historical novels.
He manages the idea that the first world war was just a horrendous war on the Western front.
"Beautiful and Enormous" explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with the fact that their nests fall on them, have to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or confront the presence of the tes-tse flies.
It's almost the beginning of a very exciting reading.
The war will devour people's lives as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, who is inhaling gunfire.
When the work starts to be called a gunshot in the distance and you're a woman who's home with her children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually getting close?
Nearly no one understands what's going on, even why the whole war was fought.
"Vakuum arising from lack of facts," said Mr. Englund, "was filled with ghosts, thoughts, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fams."
"Breath and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are everywhere taken from biographies, letters, and other material that has already been published.
Their descriptions of their lives may sound scary and puzzling, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are completely alive and credible.
Many of them talk about losing and settling with him.
In a German student's story, the author says, "Refunds, all over the place."
"A coffee substitute, clay-like, rubber imitation, paper wrappers, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It is referred to as "a mass made of liquefied rice cooked in bulk fat (and supplemented by false bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potatoes, bottled nuts".
It refers to the existence of "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of parks and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds in himself an inner flood of savagery and brutality, which proclaims the war: "At last you will understand that this is the human nature. Never sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that behind this crag I don't hide any barbarians."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that with the greatest probability he will soon die, and no one will ever notice it, just to grieve.
"If a person finally accepts the sacrifice, he would at least wait for it to happen in front of the eyes of the grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, it seems like a "criminal" that he secretly bites.
Further notes concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new threats.
"The conflict with the more economic competition and competition struggles," says Mr. Englund, "was a war between factories."
He caught what he says "the new kind of beast of the coming century: a marked and ideologically imperishable mass killer in a dress cut in peace that carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave totally unexpected, subtly dealing with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes the soldiers who were deliberately trying to catch some sexually transmitted disease to avoid serving on the front.
"The most difficult example of this behavior was the trade with gonococcal nests, which the soldiers bought and cast off their genitals in the hope that it would end in the hospital," he writes.
"The most dazzling of all has been thrown into his eyes, which has often blinded him to the end of his life."
In this translation from Sweden from Peter Gravese, Mr. Engunda is fresh, but it is not so obvious, which fits perfectly with his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way in which the war has "dissolved completely insurmountable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders have to fight.
The best books on the first world war were mostly more than with complex reports, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussella or the Romans as "On the West Front Peace" by Eric Marie Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most confusing marriage that there are no periods in popular scientific literature.
I'm not going to betray him to you, though.
But you'll look like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled out a page from the list of heroes out of his hand and burned it.
After the previous mistake this time for a minute exactly planned time
Hundreds of policemen took part, some of whom were in the suburbs used in street trouble.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the action except for a few senior officials, and the others were first told it was a practice.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly stood in front of the event, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
Cases in the last few weeks should not be repeated, for example, when pepper sprays were used against demonstrators, which violated the rules of the department and also the wave of public sympathy turned to the side of the squatters.
That was why police operations aimed at cleaning Zuccotti Park from demonstrators were launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders allowed themselves to be inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
Massive exercises for behaviour in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island section, which was prepared for action at Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have promoted so-called peace suppression training - counter-terrorist measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police - focusing on the city of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last moment" and someone who had originally been explained as "training".
"I know a few policemen who were also invited to this event, and certainly no one told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only if he remained anonymous.
"The fact that he's going to Zuccotti Park, they only knew the highest position of a member of the department."
One reason for hiding was a lesson that the city had received once.
On 14 October, city representatives had to clean up the park, but then they stopped from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they moved them to the park before the start of the operation.
The internal actions were attended by police officers from various units, including invading groups from all over the area - dozens of police officers who are usually used to strengthen the quarter with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day in the park, a large number of people are leaving, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to carry it out at a time when there will be at least people in the park," he said.
Before the units went out, they were stationed on the street of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge bridge, freight cars of emergency units with cloud lamps and amplifications.
The light and feeding news of the amply many demonstrators scared.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators packed their things and left.
Police claim that until 1:45 in the morning, she didn't touch a single apartment, which she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things up.
Other police teams were watched as they assembled on the edge of the park so that they could enter it if there was a need for a arrest.
The reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, chief spokesperson for the police department, claimed it was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and in addition, some policemen were rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the television stations on Church Street leading along the western border of the park could film without any problems.
The police took a western course and filed a huge mix of personal protesting items, including bags and Igelite bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygienic department, who immediately took everything that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were removed from the park. Documenting material appeared on the Internet a moment later.
The most vulnerable group of demonstrators retreated to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some have created a spell, and the police have started their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people joined the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of emergency services were called to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 in the morning there was no arrest, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, it sounded like a police statement.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place on the basis of "organisation of alertness and resistance in arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, was the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Detectives at the Department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he didn't share in the operation," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it would be necessary to call her.
On Cortland Street Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street Street, a block south of the park, were affected by disturbances.
From these places, the police have developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, policemen, many of whom were equipped with shields, were seen pushing people further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The most savage events of the night have been going south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning one demonstrationer was watched south of Pine Street, as he jumped on the police car cap, and several others who fired the air from the tires of the police delivery.
At one point, a piece of a crossbow flew out of the dove.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protestant were hospitalized.
The Association of Assistant Workers will sue the city for release
The committees representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that release was not necessary and also discrimination was due to the disproportionate impact on schools visited by poor students.
The Court is likely to have the last option left to the District Council 37 committees in their efforts to reverse the decision to resign.
On 7 October, six seven hundred and two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the highest paid city employees, lost their jobs. Their resignations were described as a rebate of the city because last spring they were unable to access the health care fund managed by staff members, using which the city wanted to get a hole in the budget.
The city's representatives categorically rejected this charge.
At the meeting of the City Council last month, the Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that the discharge was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately examined that there was no specific discussion on the release of auxiliary workers in the budget.
The representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue her. On Wednesday, they allowed a press conference, where they formally announced the complaint to the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education will be accused in the process, while the complaining party will be eight fired workers, all of whom are African Americans or Spanish, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the legal department of the city, said that the city had not yet seen the prosecution, and that is why he would not speak up for individual charges.
According to the draft complaint that the New York Times had been able to obtain, the committees focused on the number of missing persons in the poor parts of the city, which they wanted to support their claim of unfair conduct.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island part had not been released at all and only at least in the Upper East Side part, in Brooklyn, in the District 23 in Brownsville, there were 17 school assistants and in the District 8 and 9 parts of the South Bronx, there were even 46 assistants.
It reminds us that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, although it is a school where 68 per cent of students live in poverty. The complaint says: "It is not about the neighborhood of full-time parents who can raise funds to balance the budget deficit."
The public school budget for 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed its way of calculating bonus finance for every registered poor student.
In addition, the Committee argues that the managers of secondary schools could be confused by the way a document approving the release of parent coordinators was written.
The word "excess" was used in the document to describe the event, so to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the teacher's movement from the school's payroll to the workers' database, whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parents coordinators have been released," the complaint stands in the proposal, "and not only moved to a database for accessible workers."
The mission is at the end, Congress is ready to accept agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress seem to agree on something regarding the rise in Libya.
Before this happened, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time, the ruling dictator Muammar Kaddafi had to be arrested and killed and the United States units' participation was terminated.
On Tuesday, the Commission on International Relations of the Senate will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful rise to the US units for "statutory".
"With this statement, we want to assess the courage of the Libyans who began rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The above words may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya until now was easy.
During the years, legislators on both sides have been constantly negotiating with the White House the adoption of a series of declarations for approval or the rejection of the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced resolutions allowing limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the Senate because of the different views of both political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
However, on the 10th day when this proposal was rejected in November, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
Thus the US mission in Libya literally felt in legislative cleansing - Congress criticised the way President Obama manages the mission, but his members obviously did not do it so much to stop supporting him in doing so.
The importance of the convention finally preceded other events.
The rebels in August won Tripoli, and on October 20 he was killed by Kaddafi.
The mission then officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission on International Relations, in its declaration "happily congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and a wonderful experience which they have set out to free their people" and "glorify the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary status and professionalism."
The declaration also "confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irrevocable transition to democracy in Libya."
Is the new proposal fully supported by the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be re-divided into two-halfs, as was the case with the adoption of the June proposal?
Against the last version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the representative of the Republican Party, was appointed by the Commission.
Lugar's speech on Monday said he hasn't seen the final version of the new proposal yet.
In November this week, there will be a vote on an addendum to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution relating to the budget or other subject to be voted on by the whole of November or the Senate.
The other legislators, for the time being, have not yet made a significant effort to push their proposals to the vote on their own.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 additions to the constitution, which were presented at the convention and affected the wide range of themes.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal presented to the House and the Senate - and others are only minor exchanges of others.
Only 15 versions of the balance sheet add-on and other versions can be found in Snow White, which would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can be guided by their "authority".
The proposal for a regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, called for the vote by the Senate on an addendum to the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of an unconditional declaration to support the development of such an addition.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss a limitation of the number of periods in which the members of the congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be in the office of President.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a whole range of supplements that would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The long-term proposal remains an addendum prohibiting the marriage of couples of the same sex and an addendum prohibiting the burning of the State flag.
Some legislators also wish to allow the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of the States oppose them.
Although the members of the Congress seem to be very active in designing various additives, compared to the previous years, they do not significantly push the average.
At the 111th Congress, 77 additionals were offered, while at the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison with the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics, the Senate libraries offered more than 150 additionals every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current policy.
The last addition that was added - 27th addition - was ratified in 1992, but actually the Congress was designed in 1789.
"Blowed, but not beaten," says Gifford in his first television interview from the shooting
Ten months after she was hit by a gunman at a public meeting with the voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on the national television on Monday night, sang with a melody from the Broadway Show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and announced that more than a return to Congress is worth healing.
Giffords appeared in the "20/20" series at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the creation of the plant was still making problems and needed help in the process.
The whole series documented her difficulty in reconvalence, which was necessary for the wound of a bullet caused by the wound that struck her head in front, pierced her left half of her brain, and came out of her head.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to Snowfall to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview from the ice shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, describing his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gaifford answered, "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly special part of the "20/20" series, which was released in the evening of the release of this couple's new book, called "The Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
The Special followed the entire Gifford reconvalence since the 8th of January.
On the videos that Kelly filmed during the first week, it's seeing Giffords in the hospital bed with his head shaved and long scars across the forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than lift one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teaching her how to perform simple activities.
Head injury.
Disposal of the lips.
And then, her first word, "What."
During a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toast" when she needed changes in her breakfast.
The video posted by the ABC station shows that the difficult role for the recovery of the Giffords music: Congressman on them sings along with the therapist on the song "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" from Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" from Tom Petty.
During the interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day on therapy, Sawyer pretends to remember nothing from the day he got shot.
Her husband said that the Giffords read news articles about the shooting by 12 March, when she first asked him who was the sixth woman who was killed during the incident.
From the shooting, the suspect is Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a prison in Missouri, where under the influence of violent medications waits for trial.
"Many people died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Hungry, horrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer said that at one point his wife said during the reconvalence: "I lost."
"So I immediately told her: Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got a load.
But you can do it, you can get back together, and you'll be even stronger than you've ever been."
Military units meet with more compassion than with respect
This event was a gala night on Wall Street, which cost millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and sailors ran around him.
A well - dressed crowd rose up and excitedly shouted.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who arranged spring benefits.
On the evening of the celebration, the then chairman of the headquarters committee was also admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military units in a different way.
"All were represented as being poor," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought so well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect.
Thus, the very opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often well - directed, sometimes praising the American public.
The army is clearly included in the praise for its victims.
But these praises are worth something, the soldiers say.
The public still behaves more like an individual in a uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the units in Iraq and was soon leaving Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to make us a part of the unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or to show their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face when returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of pity are spoken in silence and in private among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano returned from the battles where they served as members of the maritime forces, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
From the standpoint of some, they will feel respect and admiration because they have defeated enemy uprisings and visited exotic sites.
In other words, he will shake his head if "he does not hide himself under the surface of the evil, violent veteran," said Cancian, who took part in the struggles in Iraq and took a place in Washington in the government after his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who had been interviewing him were inconceivably suggesting that soon after the fight came back, he could cope with the stress that was linked to the work in Washington.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The army's concern is partly driven by American greed for war.
The success of the battlefield is only a few times in recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan finds only little of its own benefit.
"As a nation we no longer regard military herory as usual for World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the United States units in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in the arms.
Soldiers are accounted for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to fight violence
This week will decide whether to initiate the trial of 28 women and men against the army due to alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other proposers are prepared to file a complaint.
The first class of soldiers was Elizabeth Lyman on the night she was allegedly raped by her army colleague for 25 years and was pregnant at the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she went to the wife at the Miramar airport in the north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she hit her male colleague with 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, if they could have a drink in her room.
"In my head there was a bright light," Lyman described.
But the Texas family totally ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"She's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
He claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, her husband went to her, threw her into bed and raped her.
This week, November 18th, Lymanov and 27 other present or former members of the army will be waiting for the verdict of a hearing that could have a historical impact. This will be played in Arlington in Virginia and will be discussed in it as to whether charges against former defence minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The charge states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the fight against the spread of violence in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
During the following months, however, their number grew to 28-25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army, and the army failed to investigate, punish, and any reproach for justice.
Burke claims he's going after the highest military commanders, because the problem is starting with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to introduce measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February, she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of the other complaints submitted in the future.
Her strategy: More than collecting all the charges on this case - all the eggs in one basket, as she says herself - will file complaints in several cases, if pressure is not required.
The defence team is led by the United States State Representative Neil MacBride, who, together with his collaborators, has moved to reject the case.
The court documents received by Newsweek are detailed in the defence strategy - in principle, that the present or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injury suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court regulation, the Federal Government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"Punishable injuries concern military services to the complainants," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this matter.
But things have changed since the '50s.
Although women still can't officially serve in the fight, it's just vocabulary: in modern wars, it's only difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers played the most important role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
As a result, 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time for modernization to take place in the army, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, except for three other legal representatives.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the Veteran Seminar on Legal Services prepare a complaint at the four main military academy for the alleged development of an atmosphere conducive to hatred for women.
Regardless of the inconvenient organisation of the American Vietnamese veterans, he collects the basis for his complaint against the army. This complaint focuses on the diagnosis of "infringement of personality", which was reportedly found in the rape victim to have the army's turn to release them - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, who belong to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a very common practice.
In December, her group had already filed a complaint against the state organisation for dealing with veterans, who was accused of discriminatory practices that should have come to processing requests for assistance from those who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented at Congress, which were presented by a group of senators and Members from both sides and proposed a whole range of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases and, according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5% of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in the year in question.
The report issued in March also broken down the level of criminal prosecution of suspects: 20 per cent of cases reported in the army were brought to trial in 2010 - half against the civil justice system.
In the case of Deputy Burke, the complainants describe attacks only as the first of the whole series of traumas.
For example, Lyman's first-class army reported alleged rape of the military police not an hour after it was supposed to come to him.
During the night, she said she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to the police, doctors and commanders eleven times.
She underwent all the investigations necessary to identify rape and found the blood of an attacker in her bed - from the wound she had done on the guard.
About six months later, in April 2009, Lyman graduated from the hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions about whether she was in love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned who as witnesses of reputation spoke for the sake of the alleged offender who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day when judgment was brought," Lyman says.
"I felt like I was having a baby right there -- I screamed out of the courtroom."
"They put me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "It wasn't his judgment. It was mine."
Lymans were ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed her personality disorder, marking her as unfit for service.
In January 2010, the army was released without respect and therefore without appeal.
Whether Lyman's case and the other plaintiffs move to another stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University.
However, he notes, "From my perspective, they should be able to move to further stages of discussion."
However, there is a doctrine that has been criticised since the first time the light of the world has been seen.
I'm alone a lifetime critic of the Phares Doctrine doctrine.
The army is several decades behind, because their duties do not allow the same level of motivational incentives and deterrents to be met.
He adds, "The odds are hard on them... but it's important to them to try it."
Only when good people are willing to fight will change.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevoa, the complainant's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other people who are prepared to file a complaint and start working on other charges relating to this matter.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue from where the reform does not come," he says.
Or until we die, according to what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of legal extremism in Europe, he was only another young man who presented his anti-restitutional views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murder warrant, followed by 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on computers during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the justice group on social networks.
After this year's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how can I find them?
Easy - just go out on Facebook.
"We realized that getting them is not really that difficult," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British research team on European digital populism.
Personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says it was enough for scientists to make easy use of advertising on the pages and, thanks to its absolute accuracy, to identify the demographic group they are looking for - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
The Bartlet team across Europe has found half a million fans of rights groups, focusing on them and sending advertisements to them, but instead of calling them into their newly created groups or offering them certain diet products, asked them to fill in the questionnaire, which raised questions about their level of education, their relationship to violence and optimism regarding their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to obtain results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different rights groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online rights groups are all young men who support the growing level of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism even with off-line activism are smarter, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hiding behind a computer screen."
The DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends covering attitudes updates, contributions on the screens and printed "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides on average three different data, which from this social network makes the word "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works, whose name is Facebook, has risen against the state five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It's been paid that once you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to a party where you'd never been released," says Bartlett.
"This is all Facebook - you're just going straight to it."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid social and health problems.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who had broken up their drunken performances on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who kept silent on this topic.
Morenová proposes that the students' rankings monitor the site and come with an offer to help the student, who publishes too many drunken status.
"The problem cannot be solved unless you can diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify the children at risk that we would not have the chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly polls data from its users.
The information team developed statistics on relationship status and St. Valentine's Day, electoral participation in 2010 and the nation's satisfaction rate (mainly using the information they had access to - the Internet freedom providers have long claimed that the site should have its share of information available to research and others).
But users of Facebook know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide the site with your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I didn't think most of the users would be able to look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist in London Knowledge Lab, for a 2006 study he conducted using the public facebook walls of his students.
"If it was about them, it was taken that information is only between them and their friends."
The following is also to consider the issue of methodology.
Even when researching offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is absolutely honest.
There is no way on Facebook to verify how much information on the profile and contributions on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, believes that the pen and pen are still the best possible tool that can be used in research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Community research should be about companies and social activities - and the hell many social activities are still being played off-line."
"Frozen and Nelidish": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public appeal
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to the two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter of "defense".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian temple knights," he told the court where 500 people gathered.
"I respect the opposition to the court because the mandate has been given to you by organisations supporting the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I don't confess any guilt to them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a speech with him, at the end of the hearing to address his victims.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, banned any contact with the media for 4 minutes and announced that the authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives and survivors.
Some have come to the hope that they will be able to look into Breivik's eyes, others to make sure he's held firmly under the lock.
They all took part in moving the case to a rapid closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and unlucky," the NRK commentator told one of the survivors of the attack.
"It wasn't nice, but I can say to myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved a little bit further.
Breivik, in the dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the time. On arrival and going to the building without difficulty looking at the present journalists and surviving in the eyes.
Despite Brevik's bizarre idea that he's part of the larger "response" movement, the judge found that he's not crazy, and noted that there's no evidence that he's got a partner.
For someone it may be comforting that the attacks of June 22 seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the anxiety and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish she would look like a creature, but that's not the case," said one of the victims.
"If so, it would be much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie shooting this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear, and they chose him for his genius as the greatest modern inventor.
For the recently republished Job's interview, which was designed for a special film directed to cinema this week, it will be for all fans of Apple that his creative mind completely understood the commercial processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a snicket and a self-employed member of hippie movement, but at the same time also a pedant organizer and a man who every detail ships in the smallest detail - believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the idea that a truly great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent result product is still a long journey of work."
In 1995 Bob Cringely worked on TV in the Triumf computer crazy series, which discussed the creation of personal computers. During the film, he played a unique, more than an hour conversation.
At that time it was ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands working with his new computer company NeXT, and he eagerly saw how the general public would accept the Internet.
Finally, only a short part of the entire Kringely interview was used in the TV series and the original copies of the interview were betrayed that they were lost in the transport.
Shortly after Job's death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
Just this material, slightly cut, forms the basis of a 68-minute image of Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which leads to selected movies this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has expressed his desire to provide further interviews, here Jobs is acting surprisingly excitedly that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the conversation, the question and the answer will take a further pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thought when it is to see how Job’s answer perfectly thinks to be the most powerful and precise.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism runs out on the surface, when Cingely’s questions act impatiently and push him to get to more important issues and topics faster.
The interview was conducted even before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone and there are frightening prophetic thoughts in it, when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Job's postmortem evaluation of his career, but on Job's, which we see here as a brilliant dream in his genius, there's something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision here of how things could and should look.
It did not last long, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also began to introduce them to practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How did he learn to drive the company:
"During the years of business, I always asked myself, 'Why are you doing this?' And the answer was always the same: Well, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, and he's never thinking about things about business.
I found out.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to simplify accounting in Apple.
He was completely confused about the way the costs were recorded - often started by writing "standard costs", he could only think about their height. At that time he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that ensured that the commercial costs could be determined during the moment.
How he put the lawn on the Pope:
Jobs remembers the "Modro Box", which was designed by Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to effectively get on the phone and call anywhere in the world for free.
It was already written in the past, but Job’s enthusiasm when the Blue Box describes it as a tool of power is virtually contagious.
They tell how the Wozniak device was tested using the pay phone and during the call they were allowed to switch from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half of the time, we got all over the world, so when we called on the pay phone, it was a minute later from the second phone at the door," he laughs.
"We were young, and we found out that we were able to build ourselves a thing that is capable of driving infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
The two of us made a small thing that could have managed to control a lot more - it was an incredible experience and I think it would never have brought Apple up without it.
Jobs continues a description of the joke that was almost finished with Wozniak. By means of the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called to the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the pope, and they were best placed to be Henry Kissinger.
They were gradually invited to continue the position of members of the Catholic Church to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up on the phone and the pope himself, the two of them spread and sat down.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and searched for spare parts to build a perimeter, he found a phone number on Bill Hewlett and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had a secured summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it formed my view of what such a society is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited a firm research laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer that was ever made".
He was big as a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right away.
As a teenager in HP, I acted high and high, flaked around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How innovation invents:
In a number of jobs during the interview, they talk about how new products are coming up.
In the beginning of his career, when he sold a couple of desks with flat connections, one customer asked him to put the whole computer together for him.
Only 30 paid days were available during which he had to devise, disassembly and add the finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he recalls the problems they faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how we had a pretty wild fight... yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300], when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
About ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable 15-dollar mouse.
As a big company, there is a breath:
Long before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs proselytically predicted that many industrial leaders in his vision would collapse and lose their market share.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, so what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At this point, there is already a government holiday and marketing, so companies are running people who are concerned about this, while people who are concerned about their own products are being questioned from the decision-making process.
The technological genius, which has led society to its unbreakable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skills and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times bigger than she was, she could have been Microsoft for the 1990s...
But instead of winning, they won the prize.
How to take innovation as an art form:
"There is still a long journey and a lot of work between a great idea and a great result product... and as that great idea develops, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to go into a whole series of compromises - certain things simply do not make electronics, glass, robots or factory.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and set them together...
Finally, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things mankind has ever created, and in a certain way you try to make them reflect on what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed that I broke up with the best ideas.
Macintosh's company was so wonderful and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and the best computer experts in the world at the same time.
Without computers and new technologies, they could do amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with the defense of the health care law at the time when their case was handled by the court
On the day that the Supreme Court sat behind the closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question, whether we would accept an objection to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a celebration dinner sponsored by a legal firm that will participate before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges came to discuss the proposed proposals.
One of the cases under consideration was a complaint filed by 26 challenging radical reprocessing of medical care, which was approved last year by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
In March, however, a 5.5-hour trial is expected, which will further develop the presidential elections that are planned for 2012 and will be in full circulation at the time of the decision.
A lawyer standing before the court and trying to reach a denial of the law will be most likely to Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States for the George W. Bush government.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinners of the Federalist Society, which has been defending conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations of questionable laws, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of enormous financial resources.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel several hours after the court discussion on the subject of the case.
She also attended, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and confirmed support for the Health Care Act.
And the guest introduction?
This is nothing new: This two judges with action group Federalist Society has been participating for years.
And certainly it's not even about anything that would be contrary to ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct which the lower federal judges are subject to.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under principle C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are directly related and other organisations for the purpose of obtaining financial resources, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor be included in the action programme."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas with two law firms in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, was rich enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and negligence against the code of conduct is contrary to the assertion of several judges that the highest court is acting in accordance with the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate for social benefits together with the legal representatives who are waiting for their case to be discussed before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines the feet of all claims of non-violence, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas to their critics showed only a lack of understanding and showed them that they too combine their judicial obligations with the actions of groups, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas Ginni's wife is a highly established conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives claim that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for the governments of President Obama when the first opposition to the law appeared before the court.
Kagan’s critics pressure her to refuse to participate in the case, claiming that she was fighting as much as possible for the law at that time as she could now be unsatisfied.
Kagan didn't mean she was going to resign.
Boeing received a record order for a current aircraft worth USD 18 billion
Aerolinks Emirates orders 50 two-way Boeing 777 with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six flights Boeing Dreamliner to Aman Air, for which it charges more than USD 1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, most of them have no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is the manufacturer of the Boeing Co. aircraft and the price of these 50-tons makes up a record of USD 18 billion, it is something else.
The same important report is also from where Boeing received the order: Middle East, increasing the gold target for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 million dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history about dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 doubles of Boeing 777.
The sensory contract came from the Emirates airlines in Dubai.
Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Air Show fair announced that airlines have the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, resulting in a total value of USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air airlines ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six-tonnes exceeds USD 1 billion.
"It's an excellent report for the whole company Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
A lot of airlines in the Middle East belong to the darkest nations of the world.
This means that they have not only the money to pay aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - most of which are damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive because the country itself earns oil at higher prices.
This is important because they are unlikely to be as likely as other airlines as they could be to cancel or postpone the aircraft orders for fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Mirates airline contract confirms Boeating’s leading position on the market with aircraft with a wide body and leads to the narrow Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus’ representatives have announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of 777-300ER, will be cancelled.
It was because customers demanded more useful aircraft loads and flights, so the manufacturer took time to add more power to the engine.
Boeing Co's stock price rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
The Mexican President's sister was defeated, according to everything, in the Michoacán elections.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon, from PRI, was helped by drug dealers in honor of the governor's throne.
It seems that Felipe Calderon's sister lost her post in the violent state elections in Michoacán. On Monday, she announced that one of her opponents helped drug dealers to win.
The preliminary results contributed to the governing elections of the Western state of Faust Valley by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of members of organised crime in the entire electoral process and especially in yesterday's elections is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a Sunday's radio interview.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion study group... and they were entertaining elections, building roadblocks... and letting people vote for the PRI order.
The PR site ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000 when the Presidency came.
However, planning a quick return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI side hopes to win in July in the presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led the day before the elections, only very closely.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative side of his brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Valleyon as a winner.
The third was made up of Silvano Aureolis, a left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who has so far ruled the governing authority. For the disbanded and miserable party the presidential election in 2012 is a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state on behalf of Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and invites other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and in December 2006 in Michoacán, he launched a military fight against traitors.
However, the violence continued.
The mayor of the PAN, the mayor of Luisa Marie Calderon, was killed just a week ago and many of the candidates for the election retreated from fear.
However, whether the outcome of the elections in Michoacán looks for the PRI side, victory on the side will help to get a new impulse.
The expected PR representative in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Washington Valley, said, "I think this victory might be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Bank of Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could reach a total decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on economic growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the ADB Bank, based in Manila, said that the fastest two growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European difficulties "too unresolved" and declared that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and resources would help to welcome the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in it together."
"So it is appropriate for anyone who could help Europe in the crisis," said for the Financial Times during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but she's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been experiencing a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy's lending costs have been dangerously rising and the Italian and Greek governments have stepped away.
The growing debt crisis in Europe was alarmed by the fact that the global economy could be reintroduced into recession and the call for new emerging leading economies to join and help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid would be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of loans from the European Union's Financial Aid Fund, the European Financial Stability Institute - would provide the Asian partners with more negotiation opportunities.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what it can," to help the Eurozone, because its own economy now suffers from a decrease in exports and the cancellation of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's an empty fact, because otherwise we could find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as the Indians, have nothing to do with European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Warsaw, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically difficult to explain aid to Europe for 1.2 billion Indians, when 800 million of them live from $2 or less per day.
"One could find that the Greeks go to retirement in the 50s and use their vacations on the beaches, which would be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian resources should be used to maintain good wages for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and lost sectors such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis threatens "dangerous dominant effect".
The bank's forecast that in Asia between 2011/2012 and 7.5% of economic growth is now facing a "risk of decline" due to European threats.
He stated that vulnerable developing markets had to create "preventive spending plans" to protect themselves from the decline and significant withdrawal of capital from their economies.
Warnings from the Pentagon regarding possible damage to the area of defence
On Monday, the Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, in Congress, firmly added to the boiler when warning that tearing automatic cuts in the budget could endanger national security and trigger a financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing through the fighting in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend $450 billion in this way over the next ten years, but it is now worrying about another $600 billion reduction if Congress is unable to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress's inability to reach a budget agreement and hence the so-called delay would cause 23% to slow down and stop many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, which is used in this disproportionate way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of the building or ship. Furthermore, it could cause serious damage to other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also have to separate many of our civil servants, and since the reduction is to be carried out so quickly, we will also have to send almost certainly civilians on a forced holiday to be able to meet the objective requirements."
"These changes can poison the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its readiness."
Finally, the battle units were touched by the scarfs, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible war operations in the sea will not touch this stock directly, the darker operations will be adversely affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contractual staff, which will result in delays in agreements that support the war effort of our people."
"There will be a reduction in the rates of paid employees, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and subsequent disruption of legal and political support."
Both senators of Panett wrote to him ten days ago and asked him for details of the possible impact on the Ministry of Defence's automatic scarcity.
"The consequences of the situation at the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid deterioration of the view of the United States as a global military power."
"We are strictly against this hard measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published the Panett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion that we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"The planned shortcomings are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It will only be seen whether Panett's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress's approving budget and boost the voices calling for the release of the Pentagon from the list of restricted areas.
In recent times, Panetta has been more open in discussions about possible shortcomings, even though he himself went to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that he was going to be released in the fight.
At the press conference a minute week the Minister of Defence pointed out a brief picture of what his resort can wait for - the shell of the army, which will, however, be missing the core.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"They'll be like a brigade with no ammunition."
"It'll be like a plane without trained pilots."
"They'll be like a paper tiger, like an army mater, a building and a bomb without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could finish the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the Pentagon speech.
"It will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to equal the possible enemy."
"As a result, the aggression will be welcomed..."
In the annex to the letter from McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how it will have a reduction as a result of "significant operational risk: late response to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibility of landing and landing around the world; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
Panetta added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to end, including those already tested, and those only in the early stages of planning.
For example, the list included the F35 aircraft project planned for a new bomber, the ballistic subnets of a new generation, the new coastal warship and the new ground-of-war vehicle that the army and the marine fleet wanted to replace Humvee.
Another development and testing of the F35 aircraft would save US$ 80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters claim that there is a need for another step in improving the army, which is needed to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize the lie
The summer view of recent news headlines tells how serious and all-attentive lies and slander are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has a full hand in accusing him of sexually harassing several women - both sides claim that the other lies.
The managers at Penn State University were accused of false testimony when they tried to hide the evidence that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested, as the released microphone tells American President Barrac Obama that the Israeli President of the Benjamin Netanyahu government is a liar.
She has managed to destroy all her careers and close the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made himself a fool when he published information that was immediately distorted by unquestionable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using the funds from his campaign to try to hide his wife's relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that shot around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in charge of his sexual intruder with Monica Levinski.
It's just stories of cheating at school and at the university all over the place.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers, just to make them look good in their own judgment.
Mentors who should teach vices send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
Studies show that you're lying somewhere between 10 and 200 cases in one day.
Let's assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life, foreign people failed three times.
The identification of a lie, or "the recognition of a lie", is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharad, when a person says, "I have you." The identification of the fraud is a serious industry of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of this research is that most of the old myths of lies have been eradicated.
Lies are quietly looking into your eyes.
It's not like they'd stick around, cocktails, reds, or shine.
Of course, don't get out of it because it's kind of difficult for liars to watch and discover.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a large building, a small expression in the face, a way of creating questions and their timing.
I spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from a large and developing field of lie recognition, and it is clear that detection of fraud is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be very helpful in today’s complex world - especially if your work involves hiring, arranging interviews, negotiating or managing people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them take care of them, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
From research we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men carry more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" - most of them to protect some feelings - that marriage people lie less often to their partners than free people (although the lies that they say are mostly "uncanny").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called initial observation.
He'll have a later finding out what to compare with.
Note the keeping of the body of the subject, his smile, the work with the voice.
You should know if someone is constantly stabbing his feet so you don't falsely accuse him of lying just because he starts to stab his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the sounds of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But just take it as a warning signal, not as evidence of a lie.
People who bear lies can stop moving the upper half of the body, when they try to remember their imaginary story, the tip of the button can turn to the door, move to the exit, significantly change the body's position, or introduce a "left after the conversation" - exaggerated breathable breathing and change the position when the reaction is difficult.
People conducting interviews often issue a false signal that the interview is at the end, just to see what will look like after it is finished.
Also take note of the subject's language.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once said and used the past time when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which led to a state-wide search for her body.
The slandering individuals can also say with a reparation: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Levinski" or the difficult question is repeated.
The most common verbal signs are just very subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "stimulating language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... let me tell the truth... of what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In such a response, we do not know too much of the facts and often it is another warning signal.
There is no magic that could expose every lie, but it is possible to gain the skills that enable the lie to be exposed.
With these skills, a person will be more likely to find a liar and a liar in his personal and workless absence.
Controversial plan for the construction of an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delay of approval by the US Government
A few days after Obama's government threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which was regarded by the committees but which calmed environmentalists - the company with the pipeline to care announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things could be put back in motion.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that the transfer of the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebrasce is convinced that the project will be approved.
This decision was notified by the company at a press conference in the home of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada Steps Alex Parbax argues that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipes will eventually be approved, although it will lead to another route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it postponed a decision on a federal project permit, from which it did not conduct studies of possible replacement routes that would enable it not to interfere with the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the water supply of Ogalla, extended underground water.
"This is really a move forward," said Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebrasky for Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably have withdrawn any decision until 2013, i.e. the year following the elections next year, however, the authorities refuse to play a political role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the Ministry abroad and expressed his support.
1 700 miles of long pipes will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refinery in Texas, it protects 700,000 barrels of oil a day.
This way will have to be six states.
This project is totally hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by workers who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipes.
However, the legislators in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would make it impossible for the company to enter the Sand Hills region and Ogalla, the main source of drinking water and moisture.
The current study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a small negative environmental impact, although the source of the energy industry said that the General Inspector of the Ministry ordered a new review of the whole process of the original study, and focused mainly on two questions.
It was once whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who in 2008 was advisor to Hillary Clinton, was not present in the conflict of interest program.
Next, the company that was hired to conduct the original study was not chosen as inappropriate because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle's accused of getting rid of fear because of her battalion
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle suddenly entered the vestibule of their Manhattan home and frightened her daughter so that she got back from fear.
The performance of the "Lady Marmalade" hit frightened eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "change of personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of foreign people," her family claimed in a lawsuit brought to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
Last November, Kevin Monk, his wife Rosaanna, a teacher at school, and Genevieve were on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk parked the car, Rosaanna Monkova met down in the lobby of their house in the Riverside Boulevard and took with her and Genevieve.
Rosaanna Monková said she stopped at the door for a while and delayed her baby for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle's pregnant woman had a lousy bite.
"The aggressive tone said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter in the door," said Rosanad Monková.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She became angry and started to speak in a loud voice, and she uttered the simplest expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her and she started looking for me.
They say Genevieve got a hysterical seizure.
"I told the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter." "The mother declared the child.
LaBelle went to her mother - who had still in her arms Genevieve - threw her away and had to stop her when she was escorted to her waiting car, said Rosanad Monková.
In the meantime, the daughter screamed so much when she returned, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting an apology from LaBelle, but they were not given any answers.
Lawyer and speaker LaBelle singers don't respond to our phone calls to make a statement about the whole cause.
The complaint requires closer unexplained compensation, but the family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family plans to spend all the money spent on charity organizations dealing with cancer children.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child."
The climate has made the economy worse.
During the first year of government Maria López Valdez grew unemployment and insecurity in Sinaloa, decreased foreign investment and with them the economy
The year 2011 will be recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which is called the government of change itself. This government has brought with it a great expectation in terms of economic progress, but for reasons of adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there has been no growth and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low autumn temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the chance of growth in the state economy, have a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first semester of this year, and in agriculture there was a 31.16% historical decline, which has disrupted the dynamics and other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, 78.03% of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21,07% were found partial damage.
According to the National Institute for Employment Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment in the country increased steadily during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 people in Sinaloa were unemployed, representing the unemployment rate of 4,53% of the population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5,28% and between July and August, average unemployment continued to increase and reached 6,19%, representing approximately 74 000 people.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantese, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, on the basis of the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of increasing unemployment related to various factors. Among them are the loss of liquidity on the market for reasons of limiting the sources of legislation approved by the Congress in relation to the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally strengthen dollars, it is not easy to earn, invest or use them for something," he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes said that the demographic factor is also involved in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, however, for reasons of immediate entry and then because even though these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. People remain and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is growing," he said.
Untrusted
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also exacerbated by the growing uncertainty that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of employed people in the state are working without taking social security risks.
Other labour market trends such as low wages are added to unemployment and insecurity. In this administrative area, the lowest payments are from the country as indicated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesetas in September, deeply below the national average, which moves to 7,375 pesetas in September.
Abbreviation of direct foreign investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the highest decline in direct foreign investment in 2011 has also been recorded in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, direct foreign investment of $630,697 was achieved from January to June, representing a decrease of 87,74% compared to $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State states that investments amounting to 17 280 million pesetas per year. These investments were directed primarily to companies in the field of services.
Dluh
In connection with the economic downturn, the government requested the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. Local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million pesos. No debt gains were recorded in November, and no government sector.
Reaction
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria López Valdés, pointed to a lack of government leadership.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of reconciliation between the individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The evolution of the economy in Sinaloa has been truly inconvenient this year. We must work intensively to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012 we have to double our efforts, lack of harmonisation of the efforts of all of us, and in particular the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. We hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López pointed out that the events as cold as the beginning of the year had stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"A weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was slowing down the economy, which did not remember fast enough to be able to reinvigorate the dynamism that would allow the acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services to be achieved.
Redefining the mission
According to Theodore Salazara Uriarte, President of the Employer's Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we note that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared, in which the objectives and economic direction of the State would be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future, which would better govern the efforts of the government.
"In general, I would say that the government has been trying to achieve good results in different areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration had shown progress with regard to the governance of public policy.
"There are elements that allow the government to claim that it is trying to be a positive one. I can say that there is a job done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana
The inhabitants of Navolato were sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of imprisonment for holding eight pounds of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuel Sandoval. He was convicted of a criminal offence of endangering health, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuel Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 at the exit of the street of Cipriano Valdez, opposite the station 80 in the district of El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer drove in a pick-up white. In the car in the box had a black bag and a small bag on the seat of the driver. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man has remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Chamber and the Court of Justice remains internal within the framework of the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impact of Criminal Acts.
It owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of the programs such as Habitat, Saving public places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be involved in the end or that they will be very late due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of urban social development stated that if construction work has gone ahead so far, it is now threatening that the government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies that require funds of more than 11 million pesos per three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. By this time, only the Federation and the city were added to the work, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They have to secure nearly 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we have not got anything. And even though we should have got a share already in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started projects and continue very politely, but we lack money."
He stated that last year the government of Jesúse Aguilara Padilla did not comply with the relevant supplies, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to ask for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million not given to them by the government.
"The constant thing has already happened to us in the previous sixties, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. In order to get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to get the means that would cover what the state did not complete," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by the State representatives regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that the request was sent to Armand Villarreal, a secretary for administration and finance in order to speed up the management process and the corresponding percentage reached as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million and even though the year is nearing its end, we have not even gotten a weight."
Court approves "end of analogous transmission" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogous digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaint submitted by the Senate and the Ambassador against the presidential decree, which wanted to speed up the so-called "off-off of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He found that there were no eight votes necessary to disable it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juana Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón did not go beyond his authority when he issued a decree stating the individual steps that would lead to the transition to digital television.
As a result, the appeal lodged by the Senate was rejected and the fact that a qualified majority of eight votes were not reached in order to enable the Court to express its position or the inconsistency of the decree in question to remain valid.
The motion for a resolution drawn up by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Sánchez Cordero, provides for the possibility of declaring a decree unconstitutional because the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter which is replaced by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) by law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Ambassadors supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero adopted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitisation.
The meeting of the Ministers also decided to reject the complaint submitted by the Ambassador without entering the discussion on the proposal, which also concerns Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that it was not compatible with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not structure by means of the general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is a federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The reward of analogous digital signals is one of the biggest changes that the world has experienced in recent years. It relates to better use of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
It is believed that to remove the change would mean to remove the benefit of digitisation, which requires a decision in the matter of public interest. Digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "also concerns economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these issues "require the operation of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State. It includes a whole range of competences which the Institute has entrusted to the government of the State".
He recalled that a whole number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical authorities.
He stated that it is not possible for the government to bring an inconsistency decree, which to some extent involves the area of power of Congress, into the area of administrative compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections is only 27 per cent. So far, votes 879 of 6074 of the electoral districts have not been counted.
The "voice-by-voice" option was found in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to data published by the pre-election programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections was not all 27 per cent, and 879 votes from the total of 6074 electoral districts have not been read yet.
In this connection, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Election in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llandral Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be noted, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political institution or his State Election Code or the Election Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this election period and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel recalled their publication within the time limit set in the Law of the Official Journal with some opposition against him.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of State (SCJN) ruled the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative powers and declared the State's head of state in the matter of constitutional reforms as "inappropriate and illegal", because it has no right "to approve or veto them".
On the question of the possibility of counting "voice by voice" María de los Ángeles Llanderal answered that the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council would enable the local electoral authority to carry out partial and overall calculations.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be carried out under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of counting of votes and calculation in the appropriate box or has no president available to it; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all polls will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition that proposed the candidate in the second place appears at the beginning of the session.
The total recalculation of votes will also be possible when, after proper calculation, it becomes clear that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also always when there is an explicit request by the political party whose candidate ended in the second place. In such a case, the electoral packages in which partial calculation was carried out will be deleted.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second non-total 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Fireland, confirmed by the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés was transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his home town. During Monday the ceremony and the back mass will be held.
According to the family, the lieutenant's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Fireland.
After the family returned to the capital of Coahuil on board the plane of the Mexican Air Force. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon the Colonel's ashes arrived in a chapel in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also arrived.
At 5:30 a.m. there was an adjournment at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, which organized his former associates from the technology school and members of the American football team, whose Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of the graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes were scattered in the Zafalinam Mountains. That's what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's sister.
According to her, the colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and went to the college of college del Aires in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said that he even drove a truck, but he always followed his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "sorry he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he had in his life best: flight management.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, deputy commander of the Mexican Air Force, we apologized for all the efforts that the governor Jorge Torres López, the citizen and government of the state, the Mexican army through the six military zones, the Mexican Air Force itself, the representatives and students of the University of Saltillo Technology, where he studied in 1985 and where he won both in the study and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after the helicopter that was driving fell. He was also on board a government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all the officials of this state.
At 18:05 the remnants of the Saltilean parent Bacio Cortés (supplyed) arrived to be handed over by funeral services to the Mexican Air Force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez on the outskirts, where in the meantime his family, his daughter Amanda and Cristina's wife, mother, relatives and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
There were three abandoned dead bodies on the ship Cadereyta NL
Several hours before the military presence, the representatives represented 11 persons who were detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed in various parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned ship of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
It was found on the 1.5 km road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at a level known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the chat with the bee-coffee area had a time since the door opened.
When they looked inside, from about three feet [3 m] away, they noticed the corpse of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One person had on himself a sports shirt of yellow and dark cotton pants and was not dressed. Next to it was a man lying in a sports shirt with white stripes.
About a few meters later, there were other persons dressed in red sports shirts and blue cotton pants.
All three beds face towards the ground.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three persons were probably killed at another location because they were not found.
On the floor of the chat area were messages addressed by one group of organized crime the other and also a number of bullets stop, both on the building and on the doors.
In Cadereyta, 11 suspects were detained.
The National Defence Secrets represented 11 persons, including young people, who were members of the criminal group, who operated in particular in the area of Cadereyta and who are linked to kidnappings, murders, prosecutions and unlawful burial.
According to the information published during the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 persons were detained and one detainee was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
The next visit took place on 12 November at 6 o'clock. Military personnel were on the march in Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyt, observing a car without SPZ and two persons in it.
After the car was stopped, they took a look and found one gun, a gun and 18 bullets.
Then, based on these statements, on 13 November around 14 o'clock, one of La Frauda's complicity was detained. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday, a new Italian government will be appointed
The appointed President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that keeps this country in control of the economic disaster.
The appointed President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that keeps this country in control of the economic disaster and which has put the euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, met with President Giorg Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could create a government.
It is expected to represent a government composed by a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet obvious when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks, which he led with the political parties in an effort to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to create a government, but his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of creating a government within three days, which is much shorter than usual. In the meantime, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has resulted in long-term debt to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must approve the hard package of measures that the European leaders require, which will only be possible to restore Italy's unresolved credibility.
In Monti there is a great pressure to speed up. Due to the instability of the markets, interest in Italian bonds BTP with a 10-year maturity was exceeded by 7 percentage points, the level where Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Employers' Organisation, told reporters after the meeting with Monti: "We said that we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this fiery situation.
Monti's hopes for success have been significantly enhanced by the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, whose crisis led to the resignation on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended for good results," Angelin Alfano, the secretary of the media, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important, because so far a whole number of its members have turned against the government with the technical majority set up by Monti.
Parliament support
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament in order to promote unpopular sustainable reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti started talks on Monday with political parties, committees and business groups, youth organisations and women.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President Napolitan on Sunday, which enabled a very rapid process in response to the crisis.
After a short decline at the end of last week, when it was already apparent that Berlusconi was giving a demise, the interest of Italian bonds returned to the critical border and responded to uncertainty as to whether the new president of the government was making a success.
To save Italy, whose public debt is moving at EUR 1.8 billion, would be beyond the scope of the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti stated that his government should hold power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite general projections that claim that politicians give him time only to carry out reforms and then declare the preliminary elections.
Monti stated that he would like to include policies in his office, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts in order to remove Italy from the country's difficulties due to financial pressure.
Political sources have stated that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate attempts to join the government and political personalities.
Spanish with participation in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 popular players grew to 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the San José National Stadium.
While world and Europe masters, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have on their account a wide range of class A inter-election matches, Costa Rica has only the defender Michael Uman, who played 50 international matches as the only one.
That number reached last Friday in the struggle against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers who play in the Battle of the Stars and in the powerful British first league clubs maintain an intensive activity over the year in league championships and home Cups and high-level matches within European Cups such as the Champions League.
In the past, we also need to add experience from the Spanish national team in complicated battles on the European and world championships.
On the contrary, Costa Rican players have very limited options for foreign battles in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign hits from the Spanish representation has on its account the Iker Casillas branch, which reached the former Andoni Zubizarret branch with 126 international hits last Saturday before England (the race 0-1 in London).
Casillas will come up against Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player in Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially declared UEFA last week together with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account. Among them the already mentioned Zubizarreta is 126 and the middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
A hundred approached Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
Follow Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side and close to Michael Uman are moving the left wing of Junior Díaz with 48 matches and Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 exceeded 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Minimum number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches is Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of him didn't even exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and follows Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, has two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour at the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, the base of Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next week.
We waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself ensures that they have the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a full dream.
That's what the base said and the founder member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent in the course of a tour of the festival of twenty years of existence and on Sunday 20 it will be on a unique stop in Central America.
This day will take place from 19:30 at the National Stadium along with the English group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the conversation you will find on La Nación's website.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes reality.
In South and Central America, we have hardly had a second and modern experience.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, for vacation, it's a beautiful country and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're so glad we can bring you our music.
I wonder, because this group literally adores, fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your most rocked benefactors?
Thank you for staying with us for so long.
It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Is it causing more pressure in you?
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the last 21 years have been created in the horizon for a few weeks.
We took a few great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we got into the form of a concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we love serfing, we like jungles. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rican and her waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tours, you've prepared a great show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning on your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limits that we can't do.
We will try to play the best show with various compositions. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we'll play every night.
When we have two songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So it's more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic careers.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, sure.
At first, I think none of us could imagine that we're going to be in a big rock band and that we're staying in it for more than 20 years, that sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and we are impressed that we can still play together.
We love each other, and we like to make music.
We're lucky we can look at places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have gotten better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the Grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, which is represented by the great ones themselves.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a move comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, there will be a group in the city, but it is much less common to have five to ten groups from one city to another.
We're proud of it and we're honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some more.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We are fortunate that they are all our friends and we are honoured that we can be part of this movement that arose in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to keep together and have the same members after those years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is a long time longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think we're all lucky that we're still in this world and our second role is playing the fact that we're always interested in each other.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have been able to open up the music paths that leave everyone with sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, respect each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find the balance?
As we grew up, it was gradually the easiest way to find a balance.
We try not to go too far on the tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of the crowd and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, remember that you have to respect music and what you have given it, and you must not let yourself be consumed by being famous rock stars, which neither one of us has ever really been interested in.
How do you remember another Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something huge.
As a band, we were three years old and never released any albums until Andrew Woods died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to some song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible it was as I talked to him. It was always the joy of working with him, laughing, having fun about music or football and many others.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The Las Robertas National Corps will be entrusted with the launch of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as ancestors?
Yes, production sent us a video with a few suggestions, and this group liked us the most. That's why we're curious what Las Robertas is offering alive and must be very fun.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's words alive?
That's Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing he's gonna do.
Who can influence you as a base?
A lot of people.
I'm the first to be attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I could talk all night about the basics that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge, even though he's no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt a slight separation from the grunge word.
When the grunge is said, I imagine groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. And if this music applies today, it's something great, because it's music worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
At first, your music has a slightly cloudy character and now it's more positive.
What's behind this change?
This is interesting, because I feel that there are a few collections in the new album that are easier to manage, but also there are songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very cloudy, although they may sound positive.
At both, when Ed played it for me, I cried, and it's really dark.
I think if you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this to me.
I also think that you can be a happy person and still make cloudy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss, which he suffers in the area of lower limbs, informed his treating doctor.
72 - year - old Fujimori, who suffers 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from a number of diseases, including language cancers, for which he has been operated four times and is currently under control by doctors.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the TV station Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why it hurts and why he loses his strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that, in his opinion, Fujimori could obtain mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times because of the cancer of his tongue, weighed 18 kilograms, and added other disorders such as severe erosive gastritis, larynx cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and running problems in his legs, appointed a doctor.
Fujimori has been punishing himself since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons who killed the murder squadron of an army that acted illegally in the first years of his government.
Music at a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguayan president, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, launches a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to reach an expansion of trade between the two nations and to address the political issues of the region.
On Wednesday, music meets with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón. This is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging meeting with the representatives of the Uruguayan political, trade and representative community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office published on its websites.
According to local media, Mujica will try to take Calderón to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy made a list of tax havens for the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his statement, Sarkozy threatened that the countries that will continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community, which called for a negative opinion by Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico is the president of the G20 since November. The G20 is a group formed by the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. With that Latin American country, it has since January this year concluded an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has sought to concrete the agreement on fiscal exchange with a view to obtaining from the "Black Paper" Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are countries that have not introduced all the required international standards of cooperation in the area of data.
From the commercial point of view of Mexico and Uruguay, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been concluded since 2004 with a view to strengthening trade between the two countries.
The vacuum installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's crime traps, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the girl's love with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month into all trades around the world, has been created from the beginning to use all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character that has to say how stereoscopy without glasses is supposed to work," said a press officer specializing in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier", because so far successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations to existing titles.
The speaker Nintendo said that besides the video is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and exhausting game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", with the task of attracting less skilled users.
Once you cross this level, you can go into the second wheel on the level games that are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome the most diverse challenges and "not subject to optical cheats".
This new Super Maria 3D approach also assumes with the return of the post to the port console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays into the notes of those who watch the saw and repeat a successful formula from the previous works. It includes that the installation of a man's vessel will have to go through dangerous abandoned platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in motion, in the surroundings, in the dresses, and also among the enemies, Luigi will also appear.
Colom approved the issue of Portilla to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has taken steps to issue former President Alfonse Portilla, who is to be responsible in the United States for the collection of 70 million US dollars.
This is the end of the process, which was intended for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country, which requires the issue of Portilla to be judged.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive power and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the extradition.
He ensured that during his term of office, he "did not involve" in judicial decisions and allowed all the publications that he had received on his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious health damage and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Colom's step means a step of execution after all the judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted in order to bring proceedings against the former President who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights enforcement is guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of a 120 million offense at the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency. This process preceded the issue, but the Public Ministry withdrew and returned the case to the game.
Trinijo helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization created to help children without education not to feel at the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of existence of the Trinijo social support organisation is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. The organisation has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
This must be added to the long hundreds of jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Last year also served to present a balance sheet within the framework of the celebration act, which took place in the former manufacturing premises of Fabra i Coats and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijo's organization was created in the quarter of the Triniat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work dealing with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Last night, a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions in Sant Andreu participated, who worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The various political representations, at the time of the elections, showed the unique nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with President Generalitat, Artur Mass, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education consultant Ernest Maragall, and former mayor of old age and current ecological-socialist council Richard Goma.
In the large hall of Fabra and Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, Josep Lluís Cleries, and General Director of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also delivered.
Mas said that Trinijo was created at a very difficult time and that today's time is also leaping across a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day is "a good foundation".
The President introduced Trinijo as an example of how to fight adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it does, nothing new," he said.
There's been a ban on the house where giant parties were held.
Firefighters own 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupyors left the house yesterday afternoon without arguing
It all points out that the nightmare that the neighbor of number 51 on Balmes Street is finally at the end.
Yesterday, 12 people volunteered to leave a building that they illegally resided in and where they organized giant parties that were neighbors. They left the building from the court regulation without having to involve the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the manager said.
The occupants who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water facilities, and also painted the walls and left after themselves all sorts of waste, especially after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and encouraged other tenants.
There's a discotheque next to the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that after the building was covered, the markets dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque emphasises that the occupants of the buildings made it unfairly competitive, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, which are worth 10 on the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the neighbors’ complaints about noise. However, the problems did not affect visitors to the discotheques, but the inhabitants of the closed house, and especially those who attended the scheduled parties, whose frequency and intensity have increased in recent weeks, according to the scattered inhabitants of the area.
The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and would forgive her for nine months.
City police have also confirmed that over the last few weeks, they have received more complaints from neighbors in the situation.
The president of the PP People's Party Group at the Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be moved immediately and thus ended with problems of civil society suffering from neighbors and destruction of the area".
The president of the people explained that only one step had been taken a year ago, but in recent months, the occupying parties had gone to all the patrons of the building and almost all the apartments, and even in one of them there had been theft.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be consistent if it concerns the effects on the civil liability that has occurred in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleaned up the building in Nou Barris.
In 15 hours 30 minutes, the police arrived at the building 35 on Mont-ral Street after she was called by the neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of the writing of proceedings, which carry more than a debate on honorary matters
The municipal selection process on 16 branches reopens the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, the company Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB) was already missing at the time of its biggest flowering, and this self-government printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The plane defined the mountain as a large metro park in Barcelona.
More than that, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not point to or north - but up (hora) - down (the sea).
The Colliserolely qualification as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with savages instead of Yogi bears.
This was the position until September, when the council announced a mega competition of 16 competitions for the same number of entry gates to Collslerola.
The gate, of course, records more of the park's thoughts.
Either this or someone's trying to put the door on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and on the basis of a reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already as sharp as the two members of this old cast chosen at the meeting in the elevator hand in hand.
And that's exactly what he's doing, he's called one of the rare accords between what three Barcelona architects and the leading university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the selection procedure has its reasons.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side began, "must" be discussed also about the "mountain side", so Ildefonse Cerd's statement of green apples was not questioned to the end.
"We must come from the principle that the longest Barcelona Park is the beach.
Among other things, his great availability.
Collserola is more complex," declared the architect, for which the name "ports to Collserola" in itself is "lexical paste": we cannot imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a definition of the zone where it is possible to operate".
The model, like Roland and Bayon, with the experiences of the urban world, qualified a proposal as "intellectual challenge" that sparks "some danger".
It is a danger arising from the "indiscriminateness which today represents the project of a public place" after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the area of the Forum's "song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song.
The first concern is the very definition of borders where they should be built.
"Something is meant to take another step", it's basically moving on.
"There must be new urbanist and planning tools in mind, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GPM)) can cause a real loss."
If we focus more on the question, the Modol believes that the deep-sea Collserol can "consider as a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographic reasons.
The module also recalled that there is already a work carried out by Patronat de Collserola, which "can't end at the garbage site", even though it welcomes the fact that the workers offer his grammatical work that will affect the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, it understands that the proximity of the mountains and cities is a kind of pass that enables architects to engage in the debate, but "questions" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill", he adds), which should be created: "Architecs should only be tools".
Bayona points out that the answer to the question that named this game is complex, because in the basis for the selection procedure there is a lack of Collserol's global vision: "There have been 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountains - the sea, but there is no further study that would look into the area and understand it as a whole".
This causes at least him to apply to all 16 electoral procedures.
On the other hand, the design of one gate may interfere with the concept and definition of the neighboring gate architect.
In his view, the Council should ensure that the band located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should ensure the entire length of the equipment zone, which would ensure the gas transition between the city and the green.
Casino passed to Jonas Larrazábal to be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the lawful emperor of Cadino Red granted his brother the love of old age to Monterrey in the process in which he was reached for alleged exodus.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison, and now he will be released after the legal officer Casino Red granted him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in the county in which he was discussing the case of the interrogation, in which he was accused by the old-age brother of Monterrey.
After the assassination of Casino Royale owner Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to apply for an economic quota to allow the workers in Monterrey to operate illegally in the betting house.
After a public complaint, the State Prosecutor initiated a criminal prosecution of the Panist Age's brother. On 2 September, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Service Agent, number 3 for property crimes was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the capital of the state.
The following 49 days after the second prison regulation was adopted and the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs lost the possibility of co-existence or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta to suspect that the owners of Casino Red had lost one and a half million pounds. However, only a few hours remained in prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city halls in San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was ordered to be arrested by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that, almost two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence was collected to prove Jonah’s guilt. Among the evidence, for example, the payment of 1.5 million pounds of casino representatives was made in exchange for a pledge that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, the legal officer of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gomez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for the mercy of the old-age brother of the region. On this basis, he will be able to return to freedom soon.
During the legal proceedings with the representative of the Ministry of Public Affairs assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been corrected and who of the partners decided to grant mercy. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain hidden.
On the basis of official record 197/2011, the legal mercy of Jonas Larrazábal is granted. In the process against him, no complaint can be made. Nor can it be asked for damages or punishment.
After the transfer with the legal authority, about 15:50 the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The court's secretary, Jorge Yanez, went to the prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to announce to Jonas that he had been granted official mercy and his case had been postponed to the archive.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate regulation on his release.
The secretary of Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash, in which he lost the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident, in which the government's secretary, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons died, showed that the helicopter was directly in full force on the ground without the pilot being able to attempt forced landing.
At the Dionisio Pérez Jácome press conference, the Secretary of Communications and Transport, stated that prior to the launch of the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions allow for years.
"Parts that appear suggest that the unit came in contact with the ground several times, the wings interfered with the tree plant 25 meters from the place where the unit lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons, so he met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no parts were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the area of the attack.
"When searching, it was found that parts of the plane were not located elsewhere, so the plane hit the ground as a celestial.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The ground shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The Secretary has ensured that it is most important at the present time to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Relief Services, announced that at the time of the attack, the helicopter of the President General Staff was moving at the speed of the trip and an accident occurred on the soft terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that during the accident, it was a regular over-flight operation," he said.
At the press conference, the representative of the SCT Pérez Jácome nominated six key investigative points:
Visual flight:
According to the air standards, the flight was carried out in accordance with the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports shall specify the appropriate conditions at the start, according to which the aeroplane shall proceed to the border direction, between the DF and the State of Mexico having the ground level clouded at low altitudes.
Selected trails:
It is likely that the dark crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the attack.
The coordinates of the attack and the last record of the helicopter from the radar are consistent, it is likely that there was no loss of control or a failure of the flight path prior to the attack.
Dissemination of residues of aircraft in restricted areas:
The information we have at the moment allows us to assume that there has been an attack on the same trajectories and on the side.
The design of the rest of the aircraft indicates that at the time of the attack on the ground, the helicopter was a celestial.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence was found to prove that there was an explosion or a fire at the scene.
The final results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several contacts with the fortress.
During field work, the aircraft remains up to 9200 feet above sea level were found, the ground is cooled, the altitude ranges from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the images, which are likely to break down along the routes mentioned above.
Information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could get in touch with countries in several places.
After careful inspection in the vicinity of the accident, in areas larger than the area of discharge, no remnants of the helicopter were found, which reinforces the belief that an attack occurred in a state where the helicopter was still a celestial one.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has initiated a gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to identify the gene responsible for the care of children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it conducts research aimed at detecting a gene of obesity in children and young people. Research called "Genetics of obesity in children and young people" allows for results of overweight.
In a report by the Head of the Research Medical Unit in the field of biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team was set up consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition experts and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
To join the research can also be a broad public, with or without authorisation. People can join IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where every assembly will be conducting tests in youth for 8 hours.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Non-Zahualcoyolt Sports Centre (East of Mexico State).
As soon as data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Sport Centre of Independence (so far from the Federal District) and finally at the Sport Centre Morelos (so far from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research was to identify the ingredients and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to identify risk factors for Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 with consent and under the supervision of parents for the application of specific food questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also be asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause disease such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He clarified that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, band circumference), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are carried out every Saturday and genes are examined (i.e. genes that are involved in child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research reflects the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only 77% of boys were obese and 47% of girls. The dramatic increase also occurred in the case of overweight', an expert from IMSS reported.
He stated that one of the reasons for seeking indicators is the belief that the country's population differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally obsessive genetics are usually explained as a failure to burn excess energy, which we consume (calorie) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct use of participants is based on a comprehensive assessment of the status of children, which will determine whether they show some knowledge of overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of black hair (acantosis) on the neck and the proposal suggests the probability that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-nucleus.
The information is reliable, doctors give it to their parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and changes in their lifestyle that they need to make in order to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: the present way of life, which means a lack of daily physical activity, the daily exposure to television and the use of means of transport instead of walking a short distance.
It also produces a large caloric intake, which is higher consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic burden, which is the subject of this research.
There will be no demands in Asphalt with UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If it were to take proper care of the landings, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand landings after each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan region, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the UNAM Chemical Faculty (FQ), who at the same time added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt landings were adequate, a significant limitation of landings would have occurred or even could have been completely removed.
In his lecture, the Technological Cause of Explanations, which he delivered during the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his direction develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture of similar characteristics asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera is believed that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the production of spices.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of the oil, is a collection of carbon molecules, a molecule with a large molecular mass called asphalts, and other with low molecular weights called maltens. Together they supply asphalt with a typical viscoalytic character.
The viscoalytic nature of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to melt, added.
This means that asphalt resistance in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures have been observed by the expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered by a flexible brush made of six types of materials, of which the last three are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt cartridge made of small stones with asphalt and then pressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms a cartridge is to use asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the tan will spread well.
If it were modified asphalt, they would spread even better, it is considered a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt insert, the last layer is placed called a layer made of fine stone, which is also covered with sand in the asphalt.
In view of the fact that this layer will come into contact with vehicle rifles, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the vehicle.
Given that as part of the alloy, a heavy load will be exposed, the plate must have sufficient fat and must be given attention to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular, water has a great impact on the function of the asphalt cartridge.
Once the area is wet, the water spreads inside and it is difficult to get out, it causes all the kinds of frogs to soften, and thus the result of the swelling.
He explained that during the production of an adjudication, it was as the first destructive film of the plaza and then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, it is not possible at the same time, but it is a process that should be stopped by the first marks using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National Science System, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of a drill, and therefore the thickness of each individual level of a drill must correspond to the load of vehicles and must ensure that this load does not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that in terms of asphalt, there is still much work to be done and research is at the beginning. For example, there are asphalt emulsions that are already available on the market in other countries and allow easy repair of the conditions without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle's candidate to become a new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to obtain Miss Columbia crown.
Valle's getting the 14th title of the first multimission.
Valle del Cauca failed to reach Miss Columbia crown again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied that she felt at the victory stage, got a silver crown and a scarf, on the basis of which she became the new first vice-president of Colombia.
On the basis of the results of the last final in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico won and starred, the said department won the first vicemission. Melina thus joined the representatives of women from Valle del Cauca, who had won the winning crown, but finally were declared the first vicemission. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellina Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000) Aljure, Jeanial (2000).
The question that many people are arguing about.
The result is the defeat of a big favorite that has shown in all previous wheels that it has to become a new Miss Colombia, and not become free of charge the Royal Police and the Most Beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who subsequently also carried the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to appoint her only First Vicemission is the fact that she did not accept her answer to the question, "What book did you like most and why?", which Martin Murillo Gomez of the literary editor Leamos posted.
On the question of the candidate, she answered:
"I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that most influenced me in childhood was the Little Prince, a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Criminals and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, this response was not welcome because of the term "culturalisation" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned to her.
After the celebration of Melina's ceremony, she said she's in peace and she's happy with the result: "The world is wise, what's going to happen will happen.
And you people, read, if you can, a little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogota newspaper pointed out that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most famous, and the one who took all the previous prices (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and the Queen's mother), sparked the envy of the other guests, stressed the queen who then burned on the stage.
It was apparent during the first presentation of the boats on the Hilton beach and during two screenings prior to the final crowning.
Although on both sides, it was known that she was lacking in the strength and skill of the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a newspaper on Canal RCN, believes that Melinda has won the title of the first multimiss confirms the fact that a candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not finally leave with the crown of the queen".
In addition, Valle has been more vulnerable to the media in recent days and has not been paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Competition of Beauty.
Only on the border, two days before the election, an international board member, Lucy Doughty, stated that they are looking for a woman who will be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In Miss Columbia's beauty competition itself is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates have been involved in such projects before entering the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to her lack of background and fibrosis, which was on the back of her wrist. However, it is completely in conflict with the verdict of the jury that chose her Miss "natural beauty" for the most healthy body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queen, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on her ass, which, in my opinion, was not too familiar, wore her points to the last day".
Meanwhile, magazine Guido Hoyos of Cromos believes that a relative from Valle made a mistake when she made several surgical advances.
"Surgical attacks are fine, but they didn't happen at the Vale.
The body was never her strong page and here she chose her tax."
For the reason of this appreciation, which was first given by the National Beauty Assembly, after watching the swimmers, there was a harsh prediction that had been fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina wished not to finally give her the highest crown.
Whether it's true or not, it's certain that Melina started her year of rule today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, it is recorded in history as one of the queens who, despite the success of Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of the inhabitants of Cali, who identified Alfonse Cana's corpse.
A fingerprint expert from Cali went into history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
4. November last year, an expert on fingerprints from the CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana", and this through comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprints experts working at the CTI department, it was this week in the ranks of Eliaszar González, a man from Puerta Tejad, who has been working in the field of judicial research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at a workshop in Chocó, where he often had to sell more than five days of laundry to get to a place where the dead had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after he graduated from the relevant courses he began specializing in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of cutting the skin, which is hand and leg.
During the week of the operation against Alfonsi Can, Eleazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
There was something big expected.
He went out to Cauca on Friday night in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. That's why they asked him to take a card with Guillerm Leon Sáenze's fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he came with the investigating team to the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of his physical vision.
He had no voises, he was dressed as a peasant in the given area, without glasses, much more skilful.
But the prints don't.
Together with a galton lupus, an inks and a transplanter and a light Eleazar began comparing the records of the dead to the records of the cards.
She wasn't disappointed: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was assigned to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzon that he was really the Supreme Commander Farc.
Stop searching
For the dactyloscope from Sijín de Cali, the recognition shown to Eleazar by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the Operational Service against "Cano" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscope is accurate science, without the possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in deciding criminal acts.
In addition to the identification of the dead, these people help in investigating criminal acts such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons captured.
When caught, many delinquents present false documents or have no paper at all.
We take their fingerprints and we're looking for them in the database.
The investigator reported that in the case of injury, he had to remove a piece of wall in the house because the thief in this place had supported himself to extract a treasure full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to receive prints, but in this case we could get a full hand print and identify the perpetrator who participated in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints may also confirm or defeat suspicion in the case of murder.
They recently found a dead man with a bottle of alcohol around them.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and that the printing of the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be conclusively confirmed that he was a real killer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
An expert on fingerprints from the CTI explained that the prints "are controlled by chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, a transplanter or a tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the delinquent database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that at present there are still many Colombians whose data is nowhere," the expert from the CTI said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just like everything you're shaking, it's not gold, not everything you touch, there's traces left.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
"Smoothing" protests in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were forced into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to live.
A large part of them waited for an order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the protests of Obsadjt Wall Street challenged the representative of New York on Tuesday, when they tried to get back to Manhattan, where they were expelled in the morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of demonstrators pressed into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through the court order that allows the "stolen" to return to their place. The second part of the movement reacted to the clearance by taking the park to the north of the city where further detention took place.
"If the court does not allow us to go back to the square, we will sit in another place and continue in the legal battle with the aim of returning to Zuccotti, and both through the assembly and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the speakers, "Let's take Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "stolen" to the removal of the camp, ordered by the mayor of New York himself, Michael Bloomberg, was reached to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced removal of the camp and allowed the protesters to remain here.
In addition, they took another park located on the crossroads of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the tunnel of Holland, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the farm land in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take their place, but then the police came and held some protesters.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people have settled in the area, and a delegation of religious representatives has also come to express their support and has also tried to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zucconti, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to be held on Tuesday, during which the law of early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced demonstrators even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to the officials who were watching the square, which caused "some small shoots," Bray, who condemned the fact that some police demonstrators were.
The court order prohibits the authorities from moving the members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or from using the "laws that were published after the ceremony began, or from prohibiting demonstrators from accessing the park with shops or other places they used previously".
Starosta Bloomberg reported for the press that, in view of this court order, the city had delayed the reopening of public space and the protesters pointed out that local laws did not allow them to return to their homes and packages.
The highest representative of the city has personally defended the early displacement of Zucconti, an operation in which 200 persons were detained and acceded to, because the protesters were "infringing the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of places because there was "a place where people didn't protest, but break laws and in some cases harm others", because "some shops received dangerous letters" and "the neighbors were concerned about the quality of their lives".
"The early cleansing was shocking and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests in the hands of an American working people," he added a spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also stated that they plan to organize "great events" Thursday in cooperation with community and committee organizations to remember two months after the protests.
Pamela Anderson will introduce Miss Maria in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, it will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in Home Improvement, a swimmer in Baywatch, a playboy in Playboy, a wife of an annual singer Tommy Lee and now an actress and model will be Miss Maria in a special Christmas series of Canadian television.
The private TV station CTV today announced that Anderson will appear in the "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" television program on December 1st with sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians and will be filming Miss Maria.
CTV today has shown footage of a television program in which Anderson, also known from Internet household pornographic images, appears with his ex-husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as Miss Maria holding in the little doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appears on the scene Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin, who recently acted as a moderator on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheen.
Krome Anderson and Peters are featured in a special Christmas broadcast CTV Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisan Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is close to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York a "person".
Japan returns to life after an earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to household consumption and thus ends the period of fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, now recovering from an earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have calculated material losses of $300 billion, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, is well known.
After three quarters of the fall, the value of HDP between July and September was in such a position that it was possible to rotate the page with a definitive validity: HDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan the tax year begins in March 2012 - also predict the highest rate of growth compared to the period January to March 2010.
Recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending is falling by 0.9% over the period from January to March. This is the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy comes exclusively from the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it, or to rebuild the infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This change increased by 1%, due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Ignatius
Flows were committed to the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "saved values" for investors fleeing the debt crisis from the euro area and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but at the same time a great burden for export companies.
With stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for the country whose economy is defined as the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their poor results in July until September.
While markets continue to attract EU coastal countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase of yen," the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa stated yesterday.
And actually, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) clarified that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
An indicator that predicts instability in the world economy has shown that the economy of the main powers is slowing down.
It dropped by four tenths to 100,4 points versus 100,8 in August.
The euro area has even reached the average of 100. It reached a level of 99.13 points.
Athens Again Spreads Uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but the conservatives do not sign any written commitment
With the fast and risky coastal guarantees and the uncertainty that again prevailed, Greece is becoming increasingly involved in the labyrinth, leading to the outbreak of a major debt crisis in Europe.
The belief that the "judgment" of the new transitional Greek government is given more requirements to Brussels than the true conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday, admitted that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the time of 100 days he received in his appointment would probably be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new measures would in no way support and repeat his requirement to vote on the proposed date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will result in tomorrow's vote on the government's confidence.
A package of 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarase's message does not explain any doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to the help of the Transitional Government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The President of the Conservatives went a little further to the address of the EU and the IMF. These organisations are going to block the 8 billion Athens urgently needed. At the same time, he declared that he would not support and sign any commitments regarding the implementation of theusterity measures.
The European Commission, already well-informed by the impact that has caused Papandre to play with the referendum yesterday, stressed that its requirements are irrevocable: it does not unlock any aid unless the new governments and representatives of the main parties sign "a written commitment without duplication and as soon as possible".
Talker for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that inspectors from Troy will return "very soon" to Athens and will deal with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" 8 billion.
There's still a moment left by the Greek cousin.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Kingdom raises Spain's main position in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a significant position at global level as regards microfinance".
Yesterday, Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, which is based on "that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man".
Last night the Queen launched the 5th World Microloan Summit in Valladolid, convinced that "no doubt" that this type of operation is "very necessary" for us to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the goals that are to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, that is, the amount that determines the depth of poverty".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsible", highlighted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacity and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are intended above all.
"We've already reached a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The sum of microloans should be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the aim was for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get over the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans extended to Spain and to other countries of the world after "what was issued on this journey by the head of Muhammad Yunus", the queen stated, and added that it was "an act of justice and the necessary recognition".
The father described this tool as a "beautiful idealist who went on the way to fight poverty". She met with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet directly on the spot with his loan policy.
The first worldwide summit in Washington and other meetings such as the 1999 island coast, Canada, in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to detect constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, served the title "the head of the family", which gave her "the move of the poor" in Valladolid.
The Queen of Sofia joined her speech by calling on the participants to engage in the discussion and search for solutions and thus to continue in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that solidarity "is an ethical imperative", to which all democratic states must be guided.
In this sense, she said that it would be wrong to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of the balloon, because this cooperation is "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that microloans are "serious and honest policies to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever before the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become the victims of poverty.
For Spain, microloans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secrets for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to people who are all closing the door. Mayor Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in the city, who "opens their gates of the spirit of solidarity which is infectious".
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of general electoral law
Without serious difficulties for the office and the president of the Christian Democratic Party of Angel Merkel, the first day of the Christian-Democrat Union (CDU) Congress took place on Monday, November 14.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it became until autumn, in particular to be satisfied by the members who consider the government's policy to the Greeks today and perhaps to the Italians as lax tomorrow.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission submitted by the Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine out of 1001 delegates opposed and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes of the sheep stand at the conclusion of Angela Merkel's speech and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the office and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: it responds to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the office in Europe, "the time has come for change".
This could be reflected in the changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the European Commission's election on the basis of general electoral law "to give Europe one face".
This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, which is clearly the inspiration of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary move: against Britain and the leaders of the CDU think that the same attitude will also be taken by Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is out.
Likewise, delegates refused to consider the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's representation depending on the weight of its economy, which is evident in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
The mayor was led to calm the climate inside his side, the office made several references to the Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not try to get a conference on "small" European states or on States that are in difficulty willing to criticise arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe is one of the main points of the "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
It's just not fair.
When she recalled that two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a fraud in the absence of a job?
The support is provided by the UMP and the Government of Offensives against Labour Incapacity.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will give a statement on the subject of the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As a follow-up to this offensive, which is based on the desire to make savings in the context of an increased effort, but is no less clear from the point of view of the presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on the inability of work.
First, because of budgetary savings, the government intends to impose on private sector employees a fourth day of incapacity before they start receiving support in the disease.
Of course, without the agreement of the company, an employee who is sick would lose four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
The measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
And also the measures that would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic achievement: to give public employees one day of unrestricted incapacity (to date they do not have any incapacity against three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the majority of the right will also abandon the subject of fraud this time on the issue of job-related irregularities.
"The controls will be much more extensive and further: if you arrive, you will return," Xavier Bertrand warned on Sunday 13 November in the conversation with the RTL station.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat inappropriate in view of the truth of irregularities in the event of incapacity for work.
These were in fact the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political effort that brought their fruits.
The French are not more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance disease (CNAM - State Health Insurance) more than €237 million was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008 daily reimbursements of EUR 11.3 billion accounted for 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternal contributions and job injuries and 54% were for job failures, i.e. €6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to the study by Alma Consulting, France had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which conceals certain deviations in it: another survey published in 2007 on the work opportunities pages of Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned responded that no day of disability had been chosen.
Another study, this time carried out by health insurance institutions, makes it clear that in 2010 37.8% of work disabilities were shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% went on.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are not more prone than elsewhere to incapacity for work.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (for health reasons or not) in France was between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 18% in the Netherlands.
Deception in work disabilities is only a very small part of the opposite of black work.
As far as deception is concerned, these are just a small amount.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 led to systematic checks based on incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285,000 had been performed due to short-term incapacity for "unjusted or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematicly controlled disability for more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadjusted or unauthorized" were estimated at 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unjustified" cases for a number of millions of employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work for black.
According to MP Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent between 9 and 15 billion euros missing in the selection of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the frauds associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy.
On Monday 14 December, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos delivered those words to Parliament and added that hundreds of days given by his government will not be enough to fulfill this task.
"To put our economy back on foot, we need support from our European partners and a new saving budget plan," the government chief said on Wednesday when he found his first public speech at the beginning of the vote on confidence in Parliament.
The application of the decisions taken on 27 October at the eurozone summit will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the eurozone will be added in the game.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be "about 9%" of the gross domestic product from now on to the end of the year after it was 10.6%) in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right to reject new restrictive measures
Mr Samaras, the leader of justice, expressed his support on Monday with a view to trying to avoid the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party does not commit itself to any additional determinant measure.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at the meeting with the MPs on his side of New Democracy.
We have given up targets for reducing deficits and debt and combating flooding, but we are against any policy that would protect economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without the written guarantee of all the parties supporting the proposed measure, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, the committee of experts says
According to the report by the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are killed.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care and so on in cancer cases.
Canadian society is living on the idea of reopening death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make a decision in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of a comprehensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the government change criminal law in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if that choice appears to be necessary in a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts quote a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada is 10th place, the study notes that "medication of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are told by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to all of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this number is highest with 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the reports come to the conclusion that they are against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also subject to control of all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered as criminal, there is no evidence that this criminalisation is causing any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides against persons who are not or who do not agree.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, the co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at the teleconference more than many cases of these seizures in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are attracted to euthanasia
Consider that, according to an Angus Reid's 2010 survey, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will help people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalisation of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of old or disabled people have a lower price.
With regard to persons engaged in assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents consider that they should not be prosecuted.
In the case of maintenance or interruption of care for the patient, the situation is less clear, reports say the authors.
The list of recommendations also proposes that criminal law specify that the withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not punishable.
The Commission of Experts also requires that medical professionals be trained to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their life without fear of criminal harassment.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care and so on in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final comfort already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Remunerations of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the Royal Canadian Society of Experts.
Mr. Pierre Deshamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of the experts-signatories of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia at the terminal stage.
"This opens the door to a situation when everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask for help in committing suicide," says Pierre Deshamps, who was studying the summary news yesterday.
P. Deshamps also emphasises that it looks as if the authors of the reports have built an autonomy of persons above all other values that create a social prejudice of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, himself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, is particularly doubtful about the data on the absence of doubt in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the United States of America.
Jordan's King calls on President Assad to resign
The lady is talking about "complexity."
Syria is still more isolated
Yesterday, Bashar al-Assad's troops were protesting before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resists and talks about "complexity" against his country.
Two days after Syria's membership was suspended in the Arab League, the European Union imposed its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, expressed an opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first ruler of the Arab state yesterday, who called on President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed "before power".
"If Bashar had any interest in his country, he would have to give a demo, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
On the other hand, Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu said that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation in the Syrian regime had not been crowned with success since the beginning of the year.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave" said with an attack on neighboring Syria, for which Turkey applies the harder line further.
The United States was pleased to see "strengthen consensus against Assad and the unfair treatment of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, the countries like Turkey, continue to apply as hard as possible" to repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian Human Rights Observatory announced, 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime were killed in Deraa in southern Syria during this time.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed "by gunshots and concentrated shooting from heavy bullets in the city of Jobar" in the area of Homs.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Moualm estimated that the country "was released on the way out of the crisis".
He also responded to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend the membership of Damascus, which he considered to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not go away", added with the assurance that "complexes against Syria won't succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering "the mechanism for the protection of civilians" and is planning to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister will also welcome the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians against repression of the regime, which he believes is "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League will be called to Rabat tomorrow to raise its opinion on the plan for a resolution of the crisis, which was decided on 2 December, and which specifically envisaged the landing of troops from the cities of armed conflict and the release of prisoners of war.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered yesterday the decision of the League of Arab States to be "missible", while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while protecting the support of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifices for Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked for the markets for a little time to be able to form his team and start applying a program that will contain "victims" in order to regain the confidence lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting with representatives of experts and employers.
It should consist of a relatively thin cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups of participants in the talks, after meeting with the appointed Prime Minister.
The president of the Gianfranco Fini Embassy expects Mario Monti to request a statement of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers of President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented nervously on the financial markets last night and asked for time.
In "democracy pays precise terms" with regard to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that he is "certain that markets will be patient and understanding".
Its appointment as president was initially welcomed, but the concern reappeared after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team including, above all, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to adopt "politics".
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the president, the new government of Gianfranca Fini will have Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy "a strong article" in Europe once again.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's speech stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change with the new government".
The European Union is convinced that despite the controversial plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is balanced in the 2013 budget, and calls for a new firm measure.
The head of the business association confindustria Emma Marcegagliová, meeting with Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy again "because a country that does not show growth cannot comply with the deficits".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the "responsibility challenge" and "other Italy", is a "apocal change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
A great stranger will be the time of life for his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid the early elections, as Italy has to put public bonds at EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that is used for nuclear weapons, announced in Tuesday an American non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents that have been excluded from this UN agency.
Last week, MAAE announced its "serious concern" with regard to the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute of Widespread Explosives by V. Danilenko (nar. 1934), three decades from the 1960s in the Soviet Military Research Centre in Čeljabinska (Ural), where he was to be involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by means of an explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991 he had to leave the centre to set up a "nano-diamanty" in Kyiv.
His company's economic difficulties should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he should then cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, MAAE recalls the clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran has come from "the work of a foreign specialist who did not only know this method well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked during a substantial part of its work career in this technology within the framework of the country's military nuclear programme from which it came".
Protimoslim criminal acts and delicacy rates by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes directed against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased or decreased slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase against the 13% of the Catholic violence procedure, 4% of the Jewish crimes and 14% of the total increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "inevitable criminal acts" has risen very easily in 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were according to the FBI motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
"After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and decency to stop again," the Human Rights First organization stressed, focusing on human rights, "the growth of anti-Muslim violence is particularly important", added the organization in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the leaders of Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these crimes," it adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports of "inevitable crime".
The "inflicted criminal act" in American federal law is the legacy of the time of fighting for civil law.
This rule of law was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence associated with race, colour of skin, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and likes more Facebook
The Twitter microblogging service page introduced a change in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of the followers, somewhat similar to its Facebook services.
New offers "activities" and "name" allow you to better and get to know the activities of other people who follow you or those whose answers ("tweets") you follow.
This enables you to know whether they are able to monitor contributions, whether they are applying for new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August at a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, said the AFP spokesperson of Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was familiar with its little instinctive function, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else's contribution, followfriday to recommend a different user) making le bonheur des initiés, s'opre a more public with a more comparable handle and that of des reseaux grand public Facebook and Google+.
On the network users immediately in their "tweets" they respect the importance of this innovation differently.
"It's unnecessary, it takes a lot of places and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Function Activity will help me better watch some elements of my Twitter," he sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
entering the Golden Rule on the Balanced Budget in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write down a "bad rule" budget policy in the institution with a view to reducing the public deficit and avoiding the possible reduction of the assessment of Austria by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the very Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Council of Ministers in a situation where the Austrian public debt is 74.6% high above the criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solubility of Austria was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay every year for three billion euros more," argued the multi-canceller and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindeleger.
Austria thus insists on the request of the Eurozone summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that by the end of 2012 the reduction of public deficits and the achievement of the balance of public accounts be recorded in the Constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (HDP) and beginning in 2017 the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be expected to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the country as well as the municipalities will have to show a balanced budget.
The objective is to achieve a public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.
Strong only
The node threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese institutions would have to reinstate their foreign exchange markets if only to continue to strengthen.
"Let's do as we've done lately, if we find too much statelessness" in the exchange course alone, he explained to Senator Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, only again came to the historical values that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on October 31st.
That day Tokyo was sold only for dollars to reduce the value of Japanese currency, which had recently exceeded the record of the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has it been regularly supported by the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe port" in the days of world economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar came back on Tuesday under 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbol year 105 yen close to the level that was the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar had a value of about 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
This development of Japanese currencies harms island exports because it represents the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when they transfer them to domestic currency.
"Japan returns" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and wave of tsunamis that devastated the Tohok region in the north-east of the country, highlighted Y. Noda, who is afraid that this tragedy will not kill only in the crucifixion eggs.
The third economic power of the world restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) and first in one year due to a survey of export growth and household consumption caused by disasters.
But the Prime Minister felt that the high value was just not reflecting "Japanese national economy".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to adopt all possible measures leading to the weakening of only.
But the governor of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had already adopted a "particular measure" which means that no additional monetary weakening can be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the institution for securities issues increased by 5,000 billion (EUR 47 billion) its purchases of sovereign securities and increased to 55,000 billion (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts devoted to the purchases of various securities in order to float with liquids.
Eurozone:
rates rise, storms fail
The risk of the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue to grow.
The European storms still worrying about the stability of the euro area are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris in 10 hours the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is losing 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new tensions around the revenues from eurozone countries that are in difficulty, markets with stocks around the world continue to produce only a part of the recent profits."
"Nurable investors are only too aware of the risk of injury," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker quoted by Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo closed down by 0.7%, which suffered from the fears of market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and the change will only continue in the narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyosi Investment Management.
This re-starting does not affect the future of the euro area itself, which continues in its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is reached at the lowest level from the month and half ago.
In 10 hours, the European currency has a value of $1.3570 at a discount of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, the changeover took place after the party of the CDU office of Angely Merkelov at its congress on Monday adopted a proposal suggesting the possibility of leaving the euro area for countries experiencing difficulties without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
In the morning, the output of the Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the output of the Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of South European countries, but also in France, continue to exacerbate the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded that the markets be able to correct the situation in Italy, threatened by the poison caused by the higher debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone summit will be his government's "main task".
Spain is once again in the targeted market direction when the country's elections to the parliament are held on Sunday.
The difference in interest ("spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Expecting the number of reporting euro area growth
Statistical figures say that France recorded economic growth in the third quarter of a quarter of a year by 0.4%, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Study INSEE revised the number below for the second quarter by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And the truth is, it's the fourth quarter that the economies worry the most.
Germany has recorded a growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the whole euro area are expected within 11 hours, while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must win over dogmats
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term differences or emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is natural that the election meeting would be an opportunity to think about such deposits and about a place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only succeed when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development has led to a double demand for electricity since 2050, if we don't want a significant part of the world's population to get rid of the important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a lack of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, and we cannot forget the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a view to combating climate change, which is the subject that is currently emerging from the ecological debate.
An accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
And that's why Germany is left alone in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case of Belgium, which subjugates its decision to find some other resource capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which considers it the right building only the last generation of electricity.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to make a decision in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to extend its park to one unit by rebuilding one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant crash.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, the reality resists it.
The Berlin option is reflected in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of electricity on land gas and coal.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which 30% of its electricity is taken, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularity, resulting in CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices above 65%, or 50% above the European average.
On the contrary, due to the uncertainty of our energy policy, our neighbor's invoice will pay for electricity by 40% higher than the amount paid by the French households.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of the industry in the national territory, the French companies enjoy the benefits of the most expensive electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in electricity prices, which would make the illustrative beautiful declaration of the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that most of the French refuse to pay, just as it does not essentially oppose this energy, as the public opinion polls show.
Remember, our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to build 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs.
A strong export sector will attract a large number of small and medium-sized specialised jobs that cannot be transferred abroad to the international market.
If France decided to abandon the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have amounted to EUR 6 billion per year, which the country earns for the export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which owner of the power plant would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years, while the crash of its manufacturer is planned?
In resolving the energy equation, it should be allowed that there is no magical source for energy production, and that there is no devil.
The development of low-emission CO2, nuclear installations and renewable energy-using plants carried out by the French industrial group AREVA will testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Agency for Nuclear Safety, which carries out non-compromised and transparent supervision of existing nuclear plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our professional teams have a sense of safety in the blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
The only thing that happened in Three Mile Island was under normal operating conditions and was left without human victims and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concept of a reactor and unconquerable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will take training from this disaster just as he did in the two previous years.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and constructors is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of addressing such phenomena.
While all those who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it to be an excellent gift to the competitors of the AREVA group and EDF and to free up their way to strengthen their leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machines control the debate so crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised for various purposes - the payment of police, courts and administrative detailed policies of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights country", which France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative burden, the object of which was foreign students, which became current when the Minister of Interior (see Libération letter of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, workers and servants".
But so far, it has been only a few times broken down under the economics.
It has to be said that in this area there is a wide gap between the left and the right.
That's exactly what Jacques Chirac said in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left of Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France can't take all the trouble of the world".
The only difference is the degree of greatness.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the horde of Polish installers in the French territory was divided right and left.
In both camps immigrants are regarded as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the magnitude of the generosity that we are going to give to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande restricts the banality when it turns out that joint development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recent work of synthesising the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages): there is a broad consensus between specialists on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Limitation of immigration protects growth and employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than former French employees by doing work in sectors with a shortage of employees.
A few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not sufficient to provide jobs.
Positive effect on wages
As a surgeon will have difficulties with work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between France and migrants cause immigrants' incomes to have a positive effect on wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
However, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prize holders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded immigrants).
Migrants are also the net contributors of social systems in European countries on average to 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany one immigrant will bring a net contribution to public budgets at 30 years of age (receiving less expenditure) of EUR 150000 for his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his term of office that he wanted to come for the missing percentage of growth "with prized teeth".
The said teeth used to detect immigrants had a very different effect.
Europe has invented democracy, left to think of European democracy
Democracy is rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember that, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the 20th century tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, holocaust, gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and Colonels in Greece.
Some people could have believed that if democracy finally triumphed over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and make it the easiest way.
But it's already known from Napoleon that it was the ease of thinking.
General electoral law, although necessary for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a "tool of printing" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of the department of power and control, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is precisely from the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The recognition of the Greek referendum of type yes-no will have in this respect the value of double detection: the need for a great return of political power, but also the detection of the disturbing feeling of his impossibility, his inability.
This ambiance must be thought of so that it can be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic campaign have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we demand a number of national referendums organized according to necessity and disorganized.
White exposed to the European absolute monarch or jump with tied legs to an empty nationalist depth: what a choice for citizens!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and uninterrupted exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not know where to stop the bill - because the crisis is in Europe.
This is the whole of Europe, in front of the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its inability and lack of solidarity.
This is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated on the international scene.
We are depressing the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it all its nations.
It is urgent to restore the governance of the European democratic governance project.
Because only together will the Europeans be able to reduce their debt burden, rid themselves of the governments of markets and prepare for the future by investment.
The outcome of the crisis will provide for a decision at European level, which will not be able to be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it will lead us to a grave.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, all of us today are urgently demanding the European economic government.
Wake up.
But think about it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, it would be a new madness and a new blind street.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to be a republic.
The revolution in the interest of that could not have been enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building Europe more politically democratic and truly European democratic overarching.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
The "unplugged" chip cards are spreading
In the optimistic atmosphere, it opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris, the world fair of chip carts.
According to the Eurosmart office, 2011 is expected to end up increasing global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM cards) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
Most portable is a wireless technology segment that enables you to pay in public transport or to direct purchases by just approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold around the world 460 million chip tickets against 320 million sold a year ago!
Their share should still rise in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach about 10% of the total market with chips (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in the retreat of the APEC countries, Europe is gaining an area in a non-contact payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, there are fewer beginnings: 400,000 visa cards were issued without contact.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour has spent 2.5 million wireless pass pass cards this year.
In order to set up a higher speed level, it is necessary to have their clients equipped from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their clients a free bank card," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payment mobile
But that's just the first step towards the payment facility of the future: mobile phone.
NFC (Near Field Communication) technology is only a small number of devices available today.
"They're late."
"But their real mind should come next year."
"We estimate their sales worldwide for 2012 to between 80 million and 120 million," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already getting ready.
The Bank of Crédit farmers announced yesterday that the test carried out in Caen will take place from December to June next year.
About 200 iPhone devices and collaborators will be equipped with an exclusive wireless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, the Société General announced yesterday that he was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay their mobile phone wirelessly.
The terrorist front goes from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaydo in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-term suspicion that there are links between the Al-Kajda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria has "not been able to secure" from now on.
"The way in which both organisations operate, and the reports of intelligence services show that there is great cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
It seems that Paris has similar analyses.
The investigation of the withdrawal of two French in Niger in January 2010 could help to shed light on the connecting bridges.
After AQMI members were taken from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their abductions during the operation by special French units.
In the morning after the attack, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone calls with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
An analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, which lived twice in Maiduguri, the city of northern Nigeria, which is the collegiate of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It's progress, but there's no doubt to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and performance of Boko Haram or in its operating procedures, which have now included human victims or an increasingly complex explosive device of the same manner of implementation as the equipment used by AQMI.
The international community in front of Washington has since developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group of mystics to be of little interest to the community.
Speedy success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, schools and fundamentalists of Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in Haoussa language means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect politicises and demands strict respect for Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters begin the fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, the Boko Haram troops became extremely active and were responsible for their attacks on police stations.
The government's response is usually the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Joseph sect is arrested and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and abandoning its activities in the north.
On Christmas 2010 he will carry out an assassination in Jos, where 80 people will be killed, followed by another in the capital of Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police command in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local United Nations will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania across Nigeria to Somalia, is now disturbing all security specialists.
Now that Al-Kajda Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the game and Somalis from the Al-Shabab movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppe said that France is in a state of emergency and is ready to "deliver all the information".
The World According to Candidates to the President
In matters relating to China, Iran or Israel's aid to Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they are being led into simplification and ignorance.
Can America's weakened crisis manage the world using simple or even simplifying ideas?
At the hearing of the presidential candidates, the voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating a flairy statement and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is already a traditionally strong point of the Republic.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or the help of Israel are among them.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the nomination of the Republican "Grand Old Party", threatened by the Chinese's call against the World Trade Organization and their charge of "managing with their currency", which is a heavy theme in America for the planned migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
It's worse if this has to contain the release of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Ambassador of Obama to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost collapsed in a position that "stirred" emotions.
He demanded a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the last seats in the polls, remains unheard of.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes to Iran if they did not succeed in stopping his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran," said the fanfaron.
"If Obama is elected again, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military aid, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of the documents.
Recently, he called for a strong stand against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing "trys to develop nuclear capacities" - evidently unknown fact that China has been its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who is supporting Israel and wants to strike against Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are all far away from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the cancelled departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses concerning Libya, and thus attach a weak label to him.
But the attack isn't easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Ladina, more positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military attacks that lead to a coup.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to be able to reinvigorate its leading position, Obama knelt at the right place.
Nord Stream, new entrance port of Russian gas to Europe
The remote Nord Stream pipeline, which connects Eastern Europe directly to Russia and led by the Baltic Sea, began to function.
It has to add gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas station, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the opening of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitrij Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague, Mark Rutte, surrounded by a steering valve of Russian gas entering the Western European network.
This new pipeline starts to flow to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas with first pipelines of 1,224 km of Petrohrad with the Mecklenburg-Pomāranian partner country each year.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is a quantity equal to the total French consumption.
And it's already reminded of the possibility of building a third pipeline pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the temporary completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
The project was strongly protested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
In fact, Nord Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany without being led through the country by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
The reverse of these two countries is losing some power: the possibility of pressing Russia's threats of closing its access to Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
The strongest statement was made by Warsaw when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-World Pact", with a call for an alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it's a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe has gained greater security of its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created markets between Europeans from the east and the west.
Russia has managed to launch its vision of a direct link between Russia and the rich Western countries with high gas consumption, which is close to its end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, the new heat that organically connects us," said François Fillon at the celebration of opening this pipeline and demonstrating the point where large gas contracts are both political and economic.
This explains the broad smiles of the leaders of Gazprom in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas pipeline.
The construction of this pipeline is also a significant technical activity.
The sea pipe is of steel fitted with a concrete plait to protect it from sea anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
His building had to be avoided by a mine field from World War II.
"Because of their safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to highlight measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The single tube is a long metal having a weight of 242 Eiffeloids, which has never been broken down by valves or maintenance stations for the entire length of the tube.
One control area was to be built near Sweden, but the lead project was rejected when the Swedish were only a little eager to see the Russian state society, as it is constantly located on their coasts.
"In the event of a competition, we will stop the flow of gas in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In the event of uncertainty, the gas contained in the gas pipeline shall be avoided.
However, this case was considered unlikely by the founders, since the weights were designed to produce one in 100,000 years of uncertainty.
The control of the state of the pipeline outside shall be carried out by the underwater robot towed ships, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device circulating inside.
This tube-shaped device of 1 meter diameter is inserted inside the tube and is pressed by gas.
For the purpose of three-day journeys, the 3 m/s shall provide accurate information on any deformation of the metal parts.
The remote pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without the need for a smaller repair.
Gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the target.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The lead position remains Gazprom, which holds a 51% share.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has a seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where tax is extremely beneficial.
As a result, Gazprom leased all its gas transport capacity for five years to be renewed.
"Gazprom will have a total capacity gain, regardless of the amount of gas actually delivered," explains Jens Müller.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was ensured by 30% of the shareholders and by 70% of the bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipes.
For the GDF Suez group, investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are certain that their costs will be reimbursed, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sand coast with borovic forests.
The valves at a height of 4.5 meters form the exhaust gate.
The sensors shall measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the gas coming before being transported to the German gas pipelines.
From last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is achieved, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - Tagger
The Italian company Moleskina, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to re-supply the writing.
It brings the pleasure of adventure, an hour spent writing in the light of the candle.
The Moleskine recorder is easily recognizable by its black edgeboards and its leaves sent white colors as if they were old times.
The writer of Moleskin, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, will decide to introduce a new design but distinguished writer.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes note of the introduction of the new product.
The pen is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used, for example, to modify the surface of the wallet.
This type of writer was highly appreciated by the writer and the traveler.
"The Moleskin returned to the shape of an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since became the leading person of the fashion brand.
It's a success here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to accommodate 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a remote hidden production from the first years when only 3,000 recorders were produced.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's hard to make up some artificial portrait of the buyer, because the writer will take on business as well as students or professionals.
The image of the writer of Moleskine is that his owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivation and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has nearly a hundred employees, and since 2008, it has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his entrants to the bookstore and through the FNAC chain to small shops in the middle of cities where he was able to spread his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and this need for a new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the writer of Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zaška", where architects or artists present their writer.
In August, at a film festival in Locarno, she also introduced new screens to the writer’s memorabilia.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pens, stickers on notebooks ... The brand expands on a whole range of carriers.
The success that sparked addiction: in autumn 2006 Mode Mode was bought by the investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the high proportion of unemployed disabled workers so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today, it opens 15. Week for the employment of disabled people.
In spite of the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people is twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is that amazing?
"No, it's up to Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, who organizes the Week for the employment of disabled."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, there wasn't a percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher."
"There's still a lot to do."
It should be said that for unemployed disabled persons, there are many obstacles to their approach to work.
This is the case with older persons: 37% is over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have graduation and of the 2.3 million students in high schools, only 10,000 are disabled.
And finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in Handicrafted versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which represent "the core of the problem", according to Christiana Grapin, Director General of the Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help businesses to receive disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There's no such thing as a way of thinking that's definitely developing, but too slow.
The study conducted in April by IMS-Entrepreprenere pour la Cité found that the questionnaire managers have a "low level of knowledge about disabled persons" with an "exceeded view of persons on a wheelchair and mental or mental disability".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the target of 6% of the disabled workers laid down in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures coming from 2008 show an equal rate of 2.6%.
"Now we are moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph's organization, responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence is the number of "acquired" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 of the more provincial companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ manual workers against 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What luck."
Before Tuesday evening (20h45), French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly fight will bring them.
We don't go so far as to write that there's a relationship between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to themselves at the stadium view of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard were briefly and well-directed.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, a Belgian coach found only words of praise to his player.
"I am with Eden and his progress is very happy, and the truth is that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in the clubs and national men's races, "that's the same, it's justifiable."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my badge."
Hazard, who was investigating Romania on Thursday night because of this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "beautiful".
You can't mention the notion of joy.
To play against Bleus, who has encouraged them for 7 years and in their winning prizes in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
More than that, because they are "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We crossed right away."
"Can't play against them, it's just pleasure!"
Kindly, Leekens even referred to pride.
"Hordous" to fight "saint - celebration."
"Hrdost" also found in the quality of the "neighbors", that France became a very high-level team in the South African city of Knysna in more than a year after the trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a huge piece of work," he said.
Although Belgium will miss the next European championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 in a plane with France direction... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will grow big," he said.
"We're just building something, players are ambitious, they're healthy hungry."
"You'll realize it for future battles." including against France.
Portugal is very self-aware
The Portuguese visitor Paulo Bento begins with a great optimism against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there were both teams missing realism.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese football representation, with its cormide since 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from luck.
There is one match left and one opponent - Bosnia.
In the knowledge of the Friday result (0-0) in the Bosnian Zenice hell, it seems clear that nothing has been saved.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour's worth of weight, but it was not able to give him such a rare goal that he could take away.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk in itself, because we didn't have a goal out there."
But at home at their wonderful Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will stand before the audience, who should create a fiery boiler there, even though the game will certainly appear as "very balanced", says an optimist, but would think of Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have a top," said a Portuguese coach for twenty-four years.
"We still have a 50% chance to be on the Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroze.
An indecisive Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to set goals and win.
An indecisive battle can be enough for the Bosnians who also need to target.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk in itself, because we didn't get naked outside," says Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, Portugal will be interested in developing the Bosnian team immediately from the beginning to the maximum pressure so that "they don't have time to think."
A good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
