"In order to ensure the protection of a person, he must contact the criminal material.
This is not just a formal sitting," said L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer, Mr Doroschev, pointed out that he was unable to get to know either the criminal act or the entire file.
Prior to that, at the previous court hearing, the suspect, Mr Gustanis, informed his lawyer of his refusal because he would no longer be able to pay him.
The meeting also held audio recordings.
The accused's lawyers feel that the sound records submitted to the court are of poor quality.

More than 150 persons, more than 50 of whom are members of the Seimas and of this term of office, have been interviewed during the IEC.
More than 200 surveys were conducted and more than 30 kroner.
S. Gustanis is suspected to have received more than 8 thousand euros, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand E. Masulis is suspected to have taken more than 106 thousand euros.
The Working Party is suspected of coercion and trade in the effects, the Liberal movement - coercion, trade in the effects and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of coercion and trade in the effects of these parties.
It is suspected that the policy on the harvest was addressed to MG Baltic, Vice-President Kurlianski of the Group, and then proposed or supported initiatives in Seim or in other institutions.
Ethics Officers: The Liberal Consensus Board on the Rights of the Vilnius Section
"The decisions taken by the government are in conformity with the laws," the BNS reported after the Commission meeting by its head, Vytautas Tamosiūn.
"Our decision was not something new.
As a commission, we had already made an explanation in July when the issue of the Fascists and Utens had been raised.
Then we said that under the laws this was a matter of the competence of the board.
And if the Board decides that any section may act as it wishes - to go with the committee and the Board agrees to do so, then the section may go, but if the Board decides that there will be party lists, which the Board has adopted, it is then a decision that all sections will form party lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there's an opportunity to stop membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamosyun, the Party's board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Liberal Consensus Board of the Party rejected the decision of the city section of Vilnius to participate in the municipal elections, not with the party, but with a new electoral committee.
In the opinion of the Party's Board of Directors, the decision of the city liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes, the decisions of the board.
By October 31st, Vilnius had to withdraw its efforts to participate in the municipal elections with the Committee list.
But the department didn't do it.
The former head of the section, MP Aušrė Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberals.
The Vilnius mayor, former President of the Liberal Consensus, Remigius Shimasius, who has promised to pursue another post of city leader, has already presented the team and ideas of the Social Elections Committee for Vilnius, which is proud of itself.
He left the party as well.
The elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place next year.
On Monday, the officials reported a tiger that had previously found one man in northern India.
The forest supervisor Mahajira Kaujlagi (Mahajira Kaujlagis) said that a man who worked in the fields had been caught by the villagers and, while trying to break up, she was taken by a tractor.
People say that about 10 days ago, this tiger also attacked and robbed one young man.
The village is mentioned in the district of Dudhva, in the district of Lakhympur Kherio, about 250 km south of the city of Laknau, Utar Pradesh.
The possession of a tiger in protected areas shall be prohibited.
Mr Ramesh Pandey (Rames Pandăjus) said that under the Law on the Protection of Rural Nature, the case would be notified to the police.
In April Utar was killed by the next tiger in the Nighasano region of the state of Startes, which suffered serious injuries.
Tiger is an Indian national animal; under the Law on the Protection of Rural Nature, tigers are considered to be a destructive species.
Last year's government data show that in the previous three years, at least one person was killed every day during the encounter with wild tigers or frogs.
Human conflicts with tigers have gradually increased since the 8th decade, when India launched a tiger protection programme that established bans in national parks and the end of major cats has begun to be seen as a crime.
Although the method of counting of tigers has changed, the census shows that the population of some 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Proposed cats and dogs must be labelled with microschemistry
The Chairman of the Committee on the Protection of the Seimas, Kostutis Mažeika, together with other Seimas members, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Law, proposing that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous micro-schemes.
"We suggest that cats and dogs should be marked by sub-species and that they should be registered and labelled by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, public funds will be marked free of charge by all dogs, while in 2020, the cats will also be able to cover the public's concerns and costs, according to the president of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, Kostutis Mažeika.
The amendment of the Law aims to address the systemic need for pet labelling.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal growers, illegal multipliers or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, according to the expected average price of the micro-scheme and service provision of around 5 euros, all owners of animals will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total price for labelling of all animals may be up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach EUR 2 million annually.
The labelling programmes are expected to be allocated through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Programme, which will significantly increase revenue this year as a result of increased redistribution of natural resources taxes and funds.
These funds will be used not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castrations and other programmes.
According to Mr Mažeika, compulsory labelling practices have spread in almost all countries of the European Union, this allows for the protection of the animals themselves (when they are easily returned to owners) and saves the time of the farmers themselves when the fugitive and the founding of the pet needs to spend a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides for travel to be possible only with marked farmers.
At the same time, labelling requires the responsibility of caring for the animal’s entire life.
The previous proposals were necessarily marked by opposition, as the relevant programmes were proposed to finance the population's funds.
"The present model of this criticism should be avoided, as animal protection is proposed to finance the increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to mark not only veterinary doctors, but also public individuals, i.e. persons from animal care institutions hearing special courses at the Veterinary Academy," says the authors of the project.
The bill was registered by a group of Seimas members representing the Seimas groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvils, Edmunds Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Winkus and others.

"Women lie better" star actor B. Arsobait is persecuted falsely
This is probably just a coincidence, but the brilliant Rudaak actor Brigita Arsobaitė has once again been given the role of liars.
At first, the series "Women Lie Better", then the show "Melagės" and finally the comedy "Melagai".
In this film, Brigita plays a prominent wife of the Hero of the Song of Kazlaus.
"I really liked filming in Melagia, because I'm more of a theater actor and I've appeared in movies rarely.
A wonderful team of colleagues has been gathered from the beginning to play a great result.
This experience is very important to me and is valuable.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the square was the dog Sunny!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would really be big and serious.
I've never seen those little, decorative fifs foursomes.
But during the filming Sunny so joined me that the sympathy became mutual, and finally I even angered her to buy it from the mistress, but failed," he said.
In the comic and intriguing peripheries of family members, for the first few minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagais" was produced by Lithuanian hits "Unexperienced" and "Besides our boys..." producer Paul Virbick and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionovas.
Your lover just reported - she's waiting.
It would be a great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
If you can't tell everyone "good news", their parents will make an unexpected statement - they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening even before the most beautiful of the year's holidays - Christmas!
But the end will be even more amazing, because no one believed in such atoms.
All the heroes are not what they seemed from the first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaite comedy "Melagai" a good mood for viewers four times a movie star: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedratiytė, Liubomir Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Gardvainis.

Before or after the cancellation of the unpaid taxes of EUR 100 million
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of the Living Place prepared by the leader of the "States" Ramūnos Karbauski.
56 members of the Seimas voted against - 9, and 25 abstentions.
Next, Seimas will be considering the amendments on or after 6 December, having received the conclusions of the Government.
According to Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentary, in three years, one person does not pay about EUR 1 thousand, and now there are about 100 thousand of such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sys regretted that in this way, Seimas would "invite people not to comply" to declare their departure and then no taxes would be charged.
Conservator Antanas Matulas, a member of the Health Committee, observed that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that by paying a small health insurance tax, they come to Lithuania to treat - they are provided with the same services as those paying this tax to the residents.
The amendments provide for persons who have left Lithuania to pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and Sodra will be released from payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The head of the "Sodros" Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will facilitate the lives of immigrants and the activities of "Sodros".
A video clipped on the Internet shows a serious problem about the hearing of a forest
It is shaped like a mother’s bow stuck in a snowy strip, and the child is still glued, worn down, and a copy of it again.
A lot of reviews and comments were received from the video.
People were dreaming of the backdrop of a little bow - not once on the ground, he was cutting back to his mother.
It is not the first time, but the child is not trying to give and is finally reaching his goal.
The picture is truly a matter of attention, but it also reveals the threat to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know the wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
"I'm clear that the arched drone has been very dejected.
From their movements, they can see that they're freaking out.
If the environment did not damage the drone, they would probably have chosen a safer path or had it hit slower or more cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," said Ecologist Mark Ditmer to the publication "The Verge".
Some time ago, Mr. Ditmer and his colleagues examined how the drones were operating.
Heart rate was adjusted for animals.
As the drone approached, some of them let go, others did not escape, but all their hearts began to cry out more often.
Scientists recommend that drones be filmed in a responsible manner, do not go anywhere near, do not cause noise and do not crash where it is prohibited.
The fledgling president called through the newspaper
On Tuesday, the Kiev court invited the retired President Viktor Janukovytis to come to the trial for his alleged state extradition meeting - a call was issued in the State's official publication.
In the court's appeal, published in the government's knowledge newspaper Uridadov Kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend the session of the criminal trial on 19 November, which could be heard by his final arguments.
The document states that Mr Janukovyčius has the right to participate in the session with a video link.
On 30 October, the Court of Justice of Kiev issued a final debate in the Janukovyti case.
Mr Janukovyči's lawyer in Russia was given the opportunity to register a foreign lawyer in the register before 19 November in order to be able to attend a meeting where Mr Janukovyči, as expected, I will have a video link with his last word.
The Kremliaus supported Janukovyčius was transferred and fled to Russia during the rise of Maidan in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that a former Ukrainian leader had been transferred to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
In that year, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to Ukraine, and as soon as the country's war broke out between the separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, the battles have killed some 10,000 lives, despite the efforts of many international communities to ensure long-term demands.
List of preservatives to Vilnius City Council in Valdas Benkunskas
The former Minister of Economy, Mr Dainius Kreivys, has already been approved as a Conservative candidate for the year.
In the weekend, during the first election of conservators, the party members rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipal Council.
As reported by the party, Mr Benkunskas became the leader of the list of preservatives.
In the first ten candidates were members of the City Council of Vilnius, Paule Kuzmickienė, Adams Buzinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audris Beautifuls, Rasa Baskienė, former member of the Seimas Lituras Kazlavickas, President of the Youth Conservative League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karasiaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration forces of the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) to the authorities to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition Group of the Fatherly Union-Lithuania Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that the group of members of the Seimas appealed to the KT to investigate the conformity of the legislation on waste management adopted by the managers to the Constitution.
"Parliaments stress that the provisions of the law aim to question the already existing projects of waste incineration plants, by ordering the Government to set new restrictions (20 km from the territory of residence) until the entry into force of the law in Vilnius and Kaunas to build waste incineration plants", says the report.
"Parliaments note that, given the nature of the prohibition on the construction of objects of public importance (i.e. the distance determined and defined by the concept of "resident territory") in the law, it is concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even denied the right to carry out economic activities relating to the production of waste incineration, because the established criteria are to be formulated in such a way that, in assessing the density and distribution of the population of Lithuania in the country, building such objects would be practically impossible throughout the territory of the country," they add.
We would argue that the legislation adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The TEC has repeatedly indicated that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and effects that occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted act.
In this case, the Government shall be empowered to apply the law back in accordance with an unspecified criterion.
After establishing such a legal regulation to breach the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, the protection of legitimate expectations, thus also the constitutional principle of the legal state", we shall refer to the reference.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration forces.
With the projects currently being implemented, the State would not only experience hundreds of million financial losses, large losses and the population of Lithuania - increase in heating prices due to increasing environmental pollution in waste disposal plants.
Members of the Seimas TS-LCD, the Liberal Group, the Socialist Group and the Senior Working Group of the Governing Social Democrats, Algirdas Butkevičius signed the referral to the KT.
A few weeks ago, Seimas managed to gather 71 votes to reject amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by President Dalios Grybauskaitė veto, which provided for the government's right to suspend the construction of cogenerational power plants already started, and also set 20 km from the area of the residential "quarantine" to build such power plants.
Since 1 January 2019, the Seimas re-adopted amendments to the law have entered into force. The Court of Justice has already proposed to withdraw the 20 km limit.
This proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the September session.
However, the government's right to suspend projects already started is not planned.
The KT will record the order of the case - not earlier than a year later.
Released LeBron's statistics at the Lakers Club
The beginning of LeBron James' career at the Los Angeles Lakers Club is not what he hoped for, the organization and the basketball fans.
The Lakers season began with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start helped to create a pitfalls due to the possible release of coach Luke Walton.
However, such languages were discouraged by President Magic Johnson, who said he would not fire the coach, but he needed to play better.
The biggest star in the team, Mr. James, should return to himself.
Although the attacker's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounded ball and 7.7 results transmission.
But she didn't tell the whole truth.
During the first ten season competitions, other numbers revealed that "Lakers" played better when there is no L. James on the site.
A negative +/- statistics show how much more points are inserted or missed by a team when there are certain players on the site.
Here, when L. James is on the square, Lakers missed 30 points this season more than competitors.
He's got 19 points more than competitors to sit on the floor.
At the Western Conference, "Lakers" is currently on the 13th place, but a few victories can turn everything upside down.

V. Ačienė on the detention of R. Acho: I believe in man's incompetence and legal protection
"I was the most incredible thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, it is likely that the services carry out the work that is to be done.
We're all doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe to my husband that everything is right and fair, that none of his dishonest actions should be done," said V. Achienė, BNS.
R. Ača Special Investigation Service (STT) held Monday - the law enforcement suspect that he was still a director of the administration of the Razeni municipality and that the exchange could provide exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the city-run Razeni bus park.
The representatives of private companies are suspected of being directly papered by R. Ač or participating in the masking of various financial transactions.
The Council of the Municipality of Rasei district of Ača was dismissed by the Board of Directors on the third April of this year following the lack of confidence.
The former "ordered" war this year became a newly established member of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party of the Gedimino Church, which stopped its membership on Monday.
A few years ago, he failed to apply as a representative of the Election Committee "Your Raseini" in the mayor's elections.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to raise his candidacy at the Raseinos Mere elections the following year, but has not yet been decided whether or not to participate in the municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė is a member of the Commission of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
Politicians say that they are waiting for further legislative action - it will depend on whether it will be removed from the work commission.
"I really don't make decisions today, this week, I think, I'll decide.
I see, if there is a need to make any accusations, I will make a decision either in my own mind or otherwise.
It must be necessary for me to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - all the time it will put into place," she said.
The representative of the opposition conservatives Seim Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėniė invited Seimas President Viktor Prinkės Pranckė and the leader of the "states" Ramūnas Karbauska to withdraw from the statements of the Group of the Party of Vidas Ačienės and withdraw it from the Seimas Anticorruption Commission by transferring it to another Seimas Committee or Commission.
It states that further work by Mr Ačienė in the Committee on Anti-Corruption of the Seimas "would lead to public-based mistrust and discredit the work of the important parliamentary supervisory commission".

Grybauskaitka calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for the investments of the European Union (EU) countries, to facilitate foreign import conditions.
At the opening of the trade and investment forum at the Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, Mr Grybauskaitė stressed that, in view of the signs of economic slowdown, the common objective of Europe and China should be "to unite efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world", as a result of the substantial tensions caused by the trade wars, the causes of "production surplus and unfair competition".
"The European Union is very important to China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment - it is important to negotiate a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade contract as soon as possible by ensuring that foreign business is expected and secure here, as well as by strengthening intellectual property protection," said Grybauskaitė.
In her view, the opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that transparency of investments must be "higher than any interest of any business group".
"Diversity, rule of law, strict observance of international contracts - this must be an essential part of the new investment relations environment," stressed D. Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupt flows of capital should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening up its market and protects only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions worldwide, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China is currently taking 25th place among export partners.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, reaching EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China amounted to more than EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania can have an adverse political impact, while Beijing's exclusive attention to Eastern Europe undermines EU unity.

The reason for the crash of the Lion Air plane: the nearby intruder
The data from the blue box of the Lion Air airline in Indonesia show that over the last four flights of the company, speed gauge malfunction occurred, the investigators reported on Monday.
The president of the National Committee for Transport Security (NTSK) said that the same direction occurred during the last four flights, including the decisive one when the other landed in Java on 29 October immediately after its departure from Jakarta.
During this disaster, all 189 people were killed on the plane.
A lot of media has reported on the unfavourable flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was actually the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," said Mr. Tjajon through the press conference.
"The Jewish box data showed that during two flights before the journey Denpasar-Jjakart was the same problem," he added.
"In social networks, there are many loopholes.
We now want to explain that in the black box (supply data) there were four flights in which there were problems with air speed measurement," the head of the NTSC said.
During the meeting with the family members of the deceased, Mr Tjajon said that the information of the flight data recorder was consistent with the reports that the aircraft had changed its speed and altitude irregularly after the last flight.
The search teams have not yet found the second black box, recording conversations in the pilot cabin.
Lion Air indicated that it had been corrected in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations following a technical failure from Bali to Jakarta during the flight.
One of the company’s founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Minister of Communications Budi Karyas Sumadi, a moderate meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for aircraft and victims and a disaster investigation.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that R. Kirana, together with his brother Kushnan, be joined by Lion Air in 1999.
"Lion Air has been acting improperly," said one man, confessing as a passenger Shandy Johann Ramadan, a working prosecutor on the island on which the plane is flying, father.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- From the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never met me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn't show us any feelings.
After this meeting, R. Kirana quickly left, avoiding the issues of journalists.
Many families are waiting for the long-term results of the process of recognition of the dead.
Police medical experts have been transferred to nearly 140 lavenders, charged with human support.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The twins raised a question as to why two months ago the blade was allowed to fly, although a failure occurred during the flight from Bali to Jakart on 28 October, among other things following the sudden crash of the passenger plane down immediately after the rise.
"Lion Air" said this failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved?
- If not, the relevant techniques must be taken into account.
The law is very clear, they did not claim that the aircraft was allowed to rise again.
These bad techniques must be answered in accordance with the law so that aircraft disasters in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr. Tajion said that a large amount of small fragments and the fact that the fragments spread in a relatively small area showed that the shipyard was likely to crash into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was unique when it crashed into the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the aircraft's engines, when it hit the water, acted in large turns - it shows all the broken turbine minds," - the explanation officer.
The Lion Air plane crash is the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed by Garuda near the plane of Medano.
After the accident, rescuers led by accident: injured and unaccompanied
On Monday evening, the Vážaijis - Plungė, the cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz met with Tilviki.
The cars were hit by a cathode, reported by three people who were injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, went on the opposite side of the road, and the father of Mercedes-Benz, who was born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver saved the firemen from the breakup - the rescuers.
The girls from Mercedes-Benz have lost their data during the crash.
All the victims have to go to the hospital.
Presidency: there is no need for any artificial reliefs due to the referendum
Following approval of the Seimas' proposal to reduce the referendum card to the first section of the Constitution which currently has greater protection, the president, the veto, says its advisor, Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - this is the requirement.
This and its exchange, in particular the articles in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority .
It is not difficult to predict that the president is really vetoed," – Knowing Radio told Dalios Grybauskaitė's advisor to internal policy on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic matters of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, so that by reducing the number of votes required for these articles, Mr Lingues would create "a negative precedent" and "an unmanaged risk".
"In the President's view, there is no need for any artificial relief, more is needed to prepare for the referendum itself, more is needed for dialogue with people," he believed.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of the amendment to the Referendum Law.
It provides for the adoption of amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution on a higher level of protection, provided that at least two fifths of the citizens with the right to vote are accepted during the referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote may be replaced by articles in the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution.
The right of election in Lithuania has approximately 2.5 million citizens: half were 1.25 million voters, two fifths were million voters.
This proposal was born after Seimas approved the President's veto on September on the amendments previously adopted in Parliament, which weakened the requirements for the number of votes for the amendment of Article 12 of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The Charter for Referendum is proposed to reduce the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May next year and on 26 May when the President's first and second elections are scheduled.
Emigrants cannot currently have dual citizenship on 11 March 1990, with the exception of some exceptions.
The dual-citizen community of the world's Lithuanians, however, is afraid that, under the present conditions, the referendum will not come - not to vote for a sufficient number of people.
R. Masuulis: Lithuanian airports "barška", therefore they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure are starting to fail, so it needs to be updated, says Minister of Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task that the State must carry out.
"The air transport infrastructure is already fragile because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - it does not even fit in with the remote planning - it is the minimum we have to do," said Mr Masuulis on Tuesday at the conference on communication between the Democratic Development Fund and the State magazine.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, as important projects will have to be implemented - the completion of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the external port of Klaipėda, the renewal of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and perhaps the construction of a new airport.
"The following decade will be very important - we must complete the integration of roads, railways, construction of the external port of Klaipeda, airport management, perhaps deciding on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, now start projects that will take advantage of our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Communications.
Mr Masoulis has repeatedly said that too little money has been given to car traffic control in recent years.
"The condition of the roads is still not improving, because the funds are not being spent enough.
We are able to build new roads, but even the most necessary supervision, for example on highways, lacks funds.
We must set the amount to be spent on road surveillance if we want their situation to be improved," said Mr Masulis.
He stressed that exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector increased 18.6% this year and the largest export market became Germany, surrounded by Russia.
Mr Masuulis again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU country carriers have to return to the country of registration periodically.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for the trailers to return to the house is absurd, because in Europe, empty trucks, fuel, fuel would increase emissions.
Most of this will result in railways because the costs will increase so much that part of the transport will be transferred to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our position," said Mr Masuili.
According to the Ministry of Communications, 12.2% of the transport sector is created.
Lithuanian Common Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Conflicts with heirs
Last week Mr Masuilis, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, announced the beginning of negotiations on the change in the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the old terminal to be demolished and the construction of a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis, Mr Masiulis, called for discussions with political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the last decade is a value, entered in 1993 in the register, and not in politics, and specialists have to decide on its removal.
Mr Masuulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"From the legacy to withdraw that old terminal would be a politically important step in order to be able to tear it down and build a new modern terminal of arrival to feel in a modern country in Vilnius, rather than in such an interesting, truly non-representative country as innovative," said Mr Masuilis last week.
Mr Masuulis also said that in Kaunas it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal and to connect the airport to the Rail Baltica river, building a underground station.
This transport space should operate in 2026 after the end of the rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served around 3.7 million people, this year expected 4.8 million passengers, and then 5 million.
The airport of Kaunas served 1.2 million passengers in total last year.

Next year from Vilnius will start direct flights to Madagascar
In the spring of the following year, the largest scheduled flight flight to Vilnius airport will be "Boeing 767", which will fly from Lithuania directly to the Bee Island of Madagascar on the basis of information from the travel organizer "Itaka Lietuva" writes the portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that airlines from Blue Panorama will be able to choose from 259 economic class and 8 business classes.
The new holiday destination will be reached directly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominikas Millowskis, Director General of Itaka Lietuva, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern African coast.
Other tour organizers prepared new destinations for the summer 2019 season.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on the possible crisis: it is important not to talk about disease
"We always have to prepare for more difficult times.
As I want to be happy, for the first time in Lithuania's history, we're stockpiling reserves for the third year.
But also a very important thing is not to talk about diseases," Mr Shapoka said on Monday when he was in Brussels.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Finance Minister and Deputy Minister Miguel Tuskienė are participating in meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN).
The ECOFIN meeting addresses issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how income from certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed until there is a global agreement.
The euro group will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian budget as incompatible with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the EC makes use of this option.
For more information, please refer to Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss strengthening the Economic and Monetary Union: the possibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is believed that the ESM functions should be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian Labour Traditions and Practices
Recently, 120 years have passed since the birth of a prominent Lithuanian photographer and cultural journalist, ethnographer and country scholar Bali Burač (1897-1972) in Sidari, Šiaulėna vald, then in Šiauliai government.
Remembering the 100-year anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how the insatiable national rebirth of life has called for many Lithuanian people, including the Buracus - Bal, Jonah, Bronius - from the very depths of the village, to be able to engage in the conquest, purification and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balis Burača, who has been traveling for more than 50 years after her home country with a camera in her hands, presented a broad and realistic view of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve rapidly disappearing national culture and had a rare ability to perceive the lasting value of his work.
In the photos of Balio Burač, Lithuanian landscapes, city halls, day-to-day and holiday environments, our people have decorated Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains much of the heritage of Bali Burač for the description of national customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite the two world wars and difficult occupations.
In the handwriting of the book, there is a great deal of intermarriage about the works of the Earth, especially of the cemeteries, of the cemeteries, of the cemeteries, of the cemeteries, of the highlands and of the people of Dzungia, of their festivals and of other traditions and customs recorded by Bali Burač.
Over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs, which are grouped according to selected texts, have been selected from museums and archives.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, which are characteristic of cupcakes, mushrooms, other areas of the Highlands and Earthquakes.

Tragic Marriage Destiny: Killed just after a few hours of marriage
In the south-west of the United States of Texas, a couple of young people who were married just a few hours earlier died during a helicopter disaster.
24 years old William Troy's Byler and his partner, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, who was killed on Sunday after midnight, was in the valley 16 km north of Juvaldja and 129 km west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
It is a wonder that the accident occurred about 20 miles [24 km] away, just as many young people have been in the years.
A 76-year-old pilot named Gerald Douglas Lawrence also died.
Young people studied at Samo Houston State University, located in the city of Huntsville of Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening in the Byleri family's hand near Juvaldi and after the wedding of the bridesmaid's family.
The accident occurred about 20 miles [24 km] away.
The young passengers flew to Sant Antonia’s international airport, where they were going to board the plane and fly the honeymoon, said S. Kennedy, without indicating the destination of the final couple’s trip.
"It is a very rocky, uneven relief area, and the hill is about 120-150 meters high," said S. Kennedy.
Mr. D. Lawrence has been flying that family aircraft for years.
According to Mr. Kennedy, he was a pilot and a soldier in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should explain the physical condition of the pilot and whether it could not become the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after rising.
His break looked wide on the plain of the rock hill, and the body remained "hazardously altered", said flight safety investigator Craig Hatchas of the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) on Monday during the press conference.
The researchers intend to get out of the car and then take a thorough look at it, but the truck and the truck will not be easy to reach, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified and the preliminary report of the NTSC should be published two weeks later.
Israel's Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," said Mr Netanyahu to members of his party Likud Parliament, his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of the President (Donaldou) Trump (Donaldou Tramp), the United States introduces a particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran all the time when efforts to provoke his aggression began," said the leader of the Israeli government.
Earlier Monday, the Minister of Defence of Israel Avigdor Lieberman (Avigdor Lyberman) announced that the new sanctions would cause a "critical" blow to Israeli action in the region.
The measures that Washington calls "the most severe sanctions of all time" began to apply after the decision taken by D. Shortpo in May to withdraw from the world power agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme, which was not otherwise assessed.
The aim of the sanctions is to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which has already reached about a million barrels a day since May, and to eliminate Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long rejected that agreement with Iran and says that its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish State also says that the abolition of sanctions has enabled Iran to finance the fighting groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran’s actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised not to allow it to be armed.
The other parties to the agreement with Iran - the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not support the US decision and say that the agreement, as has been foreseen, has so far not allowed Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.
The Court renegotiates the circumstances of the young motorcyclist's death
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, the city of Northern Ireland, will be heard by the court in the event of an accident.
On Tuesday, the Vilnius District Court decided that, in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses will be questioned at the next meeting on 26 November.
The case has already been brought before the Court of Justice, but the Court of Justice does not agree with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius District Court of the City of Vilnius, due to the death of a motorcycline accident, ordered a car driver, 79-year-old Edward Osipov, who announced that the motorcycline was driving at a high speed in the city and caused a serious breach.
The Vilnius District Court asks the District Court to abolish the judgment of the District Court and claims that the highest charge for the accident is due to E. Osipov and the conclusions of the District Court are unfounded.
The family lawyer of the family of the motorcyclist also asks for a remedy to be abolished.
Avarija took place on 11 August 2015 about 15 hours when E. Osipovo was driving a car "Skoda Fabia" from the Lakūna Street and was in contact with the main road bike.
The prosecutor accused the man of violating the road traffic rules of the car driver and caused a road accident - a man who had lost his main road bike in Piaggo.
The first police reports indicate that the driver of the engine died, but later after the tests, it was established that the vehicle is comparable to the motorcycle according to its capability.
The judge of the Vilnius District Court Roland Bužinskas BNS has said that the experts have found that the motorcyclist drove 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the speed allowed is 50 kilometres per hour.
"The car driver couldn't predict that the motorcycle would run at such a high speed," said the judge.
At that time, the driver of a glorious old car claimed to be driving just 5 to 6 kilometres at an hour’s speed.
The driver trying to stop and drop off the vehicle when he broke out with Škoda Fabia.
The Public Prosecutor’s Office believes that E. Osipov, on the other hand, had to give his way to a motorcyclist.
"New Newspaper": six Vagners died in Syria
Among those killed are five Syrian military soldiers and six members of the military company Wagner.
The source of the "New Journal" is published in Syria.
According to the source, one of the members of the 5th Syrian army corps was deployed in that territory, with many Syrian volunteers and "military officers".
"Novaja Gazeta" sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request for information on the Russian fate.
The former king of Belgium will have to carry out a parental test
This decision is a partial victory of the artist Delphine Boel.
Since 2013, she has been seeking recognition of her former monarch child.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a short love novel decades ago.
An 84-year-old king denies fatherhood.
According to the station RTBF, he may refer to the Supreme Court, contrary to the DNA investigation.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boelis - the former husband of Delphine's mother - is neither biological nor legally an artist's father.
For the relevant investigation, Delphine asked for the recognition of the "true" daughter of Albert's father.
Allotment of money to the parties of the PRC, but not to the social workers
This week, the High Electoral Commission (VEC) intends to allocate a budget of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
This spring, the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LDDP) established under the leadership of Vice-President Gedimino Kirkilo of Parliament, until the budget has been allocated.
However, they may be designated by a separate decision of the PRC in the near future, if the legal environment is changed, governing the distribution of grants to the parties.
Laura Matjošaityte, the president of the VRK, informed the U.S. that "a Commission meeting is scheduled this Thursday to take a decision on the half-year allocation of the budget to the parties".
In its view, it is necessary to take a decision on this issue by 15 November.
It is planned for seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, to allocate EUR 2,751 million.
The oppositionist Group of Fathers-Lithuania-Lithuania Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million for the ruling State and Green Union - around EUR 0.55 million for the opposition Social Democrats - around EUR 0.5 million for the opposition Liberal movement - almost EUR 0.4 million for the seven non-attached Labour Party - about EUR 0.23 million for the newly associated ‘Turkey and Justice Party’, almost EUR 0.22 million for the ruling ruling party, represented in Parliament, but neither the dominant nor the unprovoked Polish election-Christian family union.
In accordance with the law currently in force, in which, in the allocation of the budget, the Governing Council and the European Parliament have received at least 3% of the votes during the recent elections of the Seimas, the municipal councils and the European Parliament, the grant is granted to the parties that meet the requirements of the law.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow only this spring for the LSDDP established to expect to receive money from the budget.
However, this party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the social workers will receive at least a few hundred thousand euros near the next three elections - the municipality, the president and the European Parliament.
Corrigendum to the budget laws of the political parties and of the Seimas was adopted this year by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the leaders of Mr Kirkil and Mr Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the countries-green, believe that the parliamentarians will try to reject the opposition of the President.
However, it will not be possible to do so until this Thursday's meeting of the UK, so, according to Mr Matjošatitė, "the grants will be allocated in accordance with the legal procedure which has been in place so far".
Indeed, the Head of the CRA did not reject that, if Seimas rejected the President's veto this week or the new amendments to the budget allocation of the parties to the budget, a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP, could be considered by the Commission.
"When we take the decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are the executive authority that has to implement the laws that are adopted," she said.
If Seimas were able to reject veto and new laws would enter into force, the Government would have granted additional funds to the parties, which would have been the subject of additional loans.
Seven parties would have already allocated grants for such a decision.

Lieutenant: Activist Handziuk's murder orders must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and today more than 20 of them - will not be rejected.
Each will be carefully checked in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity and I do not have to get information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency, and law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only that will be possible to learn the truth and punish the evil," said Mr Poroshenko at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in the explanation of the murder of Mr Handziuk, and that the murderers, the organizers of crime and the "obtaining the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been re-qualified to murder, they are completely right and reasonably threatened with a life sentence," said the President of Ukraine.
He rightly called the requirement of the public to examine this case openly and impartially.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the statements made by the representatives of law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that "the government has firmly decided to withdraw criminals and murderers on the basis of what they would be".
He also said that political speculation on this issue would not help clarify the situation, but would confuse it even more.
"I call on all, both the government and the forces supporting the opposition, not to judge baseless arguments and, to God, not to use this murder in public relations," said the President.
- On the contrary, we now have to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast, so that the public confidence can be built.
There's no other way for us."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation for destabilization in the country," he said.
Prior to the battle of corruption, K. Handziuk was robbed and burned with acid in Cherson City in July.
She was an advisor to this southern city of Ukraine.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but on Sunday she died in the hospital.
On Tuesday, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Jurijus Lucenka, gave a resignation statement to the police and prosecutors who did not make a statement of opposition.
After her death, officials filed charges against public activists that she was unable to properly carry out the investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Minister of Public Prosecutors and Internal Affairs.
"I will present my resignation today," said Mr Lucenka to Members of Parliament, reading their investigation report.
Parliament must still support the re-establishment of the prosecutor.
Mr Lucenka blamed the activists for pressuring the investigation and for providing important information, so it was difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates presented a toilet without water
When delivering a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates' transition from traditional such facilities to the waterless compared to the last eight-year-old computer revolution.
The founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, presented a high-tech toilet in Beijing that does not need water pipes, said Reuters.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of the separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the biggest achievements in the field of sanitation over the past 200 years," - Bill Gates quoted Bloomberg as saying.
A technological toilet was created with funds from a charitable fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over the seven years, the fund has been working on a facility that could convert human waste into fertilizer or water, which has spent $200 million.
In total, Bill Gates said about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced massively, the Gates Fund is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gathes Foundation, poor sanitation conditions cause 500 thousand children to die each year for up to five years.
The fight against poor sanitation problems, such as cholera and others, is increasing the amount of health funds already being spent on 233 billion.
In order to better illustrate the healing situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates presented a glass of faeces to the toilet.
According to him, it is a good reminder that in a small example "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand germ parasite eggs".

Anxiety in France: Concern leads to people's deaths
On Monday, the French Health Officers announced a permanent ban on the use of widely used pesticides, causing concern over a few decades of the country’s population in the west.
The ANSES Health Agency announced that the decision to ban all products with pesticides metadu was adopted following a new security check launched earlier this year, even before at least three Septembers of the conviction wave in the department of Meno and Luara.
In these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfectant chemical should not contact plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used every year for about 700 tonnes.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, have complained about breathing problems in the Anje region, where there is a lot of salad juices, eye and throat.
"These episodes confirm the justice of our decision, but do not attempt it," said Mr. Francoise Weber, deputy director of the ANSES, on Monday, to the newspaper "Ouest France".
The target - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe - the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) considers to be "probably human carcinogenic".
This pesticide, sold by names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is authorised in Europe for up to 2022 when a new security check is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, regardless of whether it has alternatives," said F. Weber to that newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that will arise for the producers of lettuces, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop the use of metamas in the region whose economy is highly dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region near Nanto, more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of salads consumed in Europe each year.
The next season will be "a lot less salutary Sultens, Ridicules and Couples", last month, after the government has stopped using metam, the news agency AFP told Nanto's Federation of Producers Philippe's Retieres (Filipas Retjeras).

President Paul Biya joined the seventh term of office in Cameroon following the controversial elections
During the ceremony held by President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril 85 years ago, Mr Biya promised to preserve the "unity and unity" of the West African state.
The latest African president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was announced in the winning elections on 7 October, which resulted in 71% of the vote.
However, the elections were concerned with low voter activity, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of the Biyo inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the directors, were arrested in one Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English separatists carry out a campaign for independence.
Most of the 22 million people in Cameroon are French-speaking, and the fifth is English-speaking.
In 2016, in the North West and the neighbouring South West, the problem of alleged discrimination in education, courts and economics began to demand autonomy.
In 2017, when Mr. Biya refused to give up, the radicals declared an independent state, "The Republic of Ambasion", and raised arms.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces died during the separatist attacks and government operations this year.
More than 300 thousand people have fled from violence: some - across the border to Nigeria, but many have to live in semi-arid forests.
During the October elections in the North-West region, only 5% of voters voted and 15% of the electorate in the South-West province.
In both parts of the country, two thirds of the votes cast by Mr Biya.
Primary election of conservators: error caused by non-exploration
"When something is missing - you realize that the party has organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed access to their premises, but there were no voting booths everywhere, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank those who have fallen asleep," said the politicians.
According to him, complaints were brought, but their contents do not change substantially, and the violations themselves are not malicious.
"The complaints were made.
Not all of the people who participated in the elections were experienced - this was also new to them.
Thus, not all of our actions were consistent with our procedures.
Therefore, it was necessary to warn the CRK that the principles described are respected.
These complaints are not always the basis for doubting the results," said Anushausks.
According to the president of the CRK, there have been cases where ballot papers have not been printed - after knowing this, the ballots found in the polls have been cancelled without print.
In some cities, however, there are few places left, according to A. Anushausko, complaints and violations related to several ten bills.
"Well, since the difference between several thousand, it is really not essential for the results of the elections," said Anushauskas.
It is said that the party's members' activity in the elections was 55%, while the non-partisan voters' activity was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked on the commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also do not change - for the winning Ingrid Shimonyta, 79% of the voters (16418 votes) voted, while for Vygaudas Ushaka 21% (4441 votes).
The TS-LCD Council of 17 November will officially support the application of I. Šimonytė in the election of the President of the country in May next year.

Probably not," said the President of the United States.
However, the Head of the White House has added, and I will see them during the G-20 summit and "probably many times afterwards".

The German Internal Intelligence Chief is missing the post
H.G. Maassen's 55th controversy was further fuelled by the statement that his troubles were caused by the "radical left force" of Merkel coalition.
For this reason, he was not transferred to another post, as promised before, but was forced to leave for a while.
In addition, last weekend, it became clear that at the meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticised the "innovative" immigration policy of Mr Merkel.
For a long time, German Interior Minister Horstas Seehofer, defending the head of intelligence, said at the press conference on Monday that H.G. Maassen's previous comments were unacceptable and that he was "insulted personally".
Mr Seehoferis, himself in the wake of the pressure on both this dispute and the lack of his party's presence in the Bavarian local government elections, asked President Franco-Walter Steinmeier to release H.G. Maassen into custody.

Women's skirts and stereotypes about wedding dresses
A little girl with a white doll in a dress - a mission (no) possible?
Can the white bed flying along the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
The participants of the Plus-Size Reality show "Divine evolution" will today prove that the beauty and elegance of the valley really do not depend on women's kilograms.
But that's not all yet - one of the girls in the project tonight will hit the tears of joy - on the filming site will appear her boyfriend.
"There are those who think that the bigger girls don't get the attention of the boys or the sights.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is a sportsman himself, but he likes what I am, he doesn't require me to meet some standards," - before showing up with a wedding dress speech show participant Aurika.
The wedding dress is not easy, in all respects, clothing - it is a complex design, it contains a lot of materials, dress is difficult, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women feel that the older girl in the white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident about herself.
I can be disappointed that a well-chosen dress model really solves this "problem"," explained one of the members of the commission, fashion designer Robert Kalkinas.
The rest of the girls in the project, R. Kalinkinas, together with the whole commission, will open up the new fashion houses Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social network star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukst.
"In deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of issues between the members of the Commission - because we all represent different spheres and we imagine the winner differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dress has been even more difficult, and that - now I can reveal - is that there have been two young people who have really not been worse than the old-fashioned ones.
It was a special evening in every sense," says R. Kalkinin.
New Year's Eve and the 31st of the unique beauty of two children, Mom Dovilė, as well as the other girls, took part in the selection of "Divine (r) Evolution" in one summer reality show.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo sessions of girls in the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls returned to the show by LNK viewers, voting for their favorites on the television portal.
There is already a second week of the international recognition of the beautiful reality of the community show in Lithuania - here the plus-size girls compete for the name of the plus-size star in the first country.
Until they are only eight - and they all understand perfectly that the winner can be only one.
The exciting and unexpected reality show "Divine evolution" week begins this Monday evening at 8.30 p.m. during the LNK.
Actor I. Elba elected the sexiest man in the world
The U.S. People magazine has published the world's sexiest man this year.
He became a 46-year-old British actor, Idris Elba.
Although the man said that this knowledge was unexpected, he did not stand up for ridicule.
I thought, "Can't be!
Really?".
Then I looked at myself in the face and thought - yes, today I look sexually, - laughing at the actor.
Speaking openly, Idris mentioned that this title is a very pleasant feeling that touched his ego.
The British star is believed to have often caught up with the words and customs of a fool, who made his childhood uncomfortable, because, as it stands out, he was "very high and cheap".
The young actor did not trust and become an object of superstition for the common people, as well as for his rare and unusual name and African origin.
"I've just caught them hard, and I'm going to be the toughest guy in my city," said Idris.
When a man dies to be the greatest on the Ose screen, I. Elba works in the evenings prepared in Spain and especially in the stormy Ibiza.
In time, a man enjoys the Thai box and has a shell of fashion that is made by making his own dress line.
The British actor believes that he is the most important person in the world - a family, so he plans to marry the promised Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the world's sexiest man chosen by the 33rd People magazine.
In 2017, the title was followed by Blake Shelton.

Governors do not require 20 km away in the construction of waste incineration plants
A cogeneration power plant in Vilnius, next to the Gariún Tower.
Governors no longer want to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from their homes while building waste incineration plants.
On Monday, the head of the Environmental Protection Committee, Kostutis Mažeika, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act, which rejects such a requirement.
According to Mr Mažeika, the "States" group, having previously supported the provision on the distance of 20 km, has promised to support the amendment on its refusal.
The amendment by Mr Mažeika provides that from 2019 onwards, waste incineration plants could be subject to environmental and public health protection requirements laid down by law.
He acknowledges that the amendment prompted the President's doubts about such an insurance.
"In view of the definition of the residential area, it is clear that it is almost impossible to find places where the objects mentioned above could be built," says the Chairman of the Committee.
The ruling majority opposed the President's veto amendments in October to strengthen the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the construction of an insurance combustion plant close to 20 km from the population, the amendments provided for the Government's permission to take decisions on the already established two electric futures, taking into account public health interests.
The latter provisions, Mr Mažeika, do not propose adjustments.

The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
Speaking of a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
On Monday, the British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on the difficult issue of Northern Ireland calling for Brexit negotiations, Dublin reported.
Speaking on the telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed the possibility of reviewing the so-called mechanism of the restrictive measures agreement, which would leave an open border between the province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which belongs to the European Union.
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland promised to consider this proposal, but refused any opportunity for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, as stated in a notice published by the Irish Government.
In the conversation, Th. May "has made it possible to review the mechanism of insurance measures", it states.
"The Ombudsman has allowed it to be understood that there is open for a review of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review is not linked to the unilateral decision to put an end to the use of restrictive measures," says the government report.
The Brexit negotiators do not have a solution to avoid checks at the border of the United Kingdom and Ireland when Britain withdraws from the common market and customs union next year.
The two parties agree on the 'insurance measures' to maintain an open border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to be applied temporarily to the entire United Kingdom.
On Monday, The Daily Telegraph reported that the secretary of Brexit, Dominicas Raabas, was seeking that Britain could withdraw from the insurance agreement on the one hand after three months.
However, Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government was "not able to support it".
"The three-month or limited-term insurance measures are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
London and Brussels had previously failed to confirm the information about the Brexit breakthrough in the week-end report that the agreement was reached by hand.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work," said Mr May in London.
The representative of the European Commission, Margaritis Skinas, also told reporters: "We are not yet there."
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, made a statement on Monday, calling for the right to obtain reliable information during the Internet era.
Among the 25 persons who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Old (Amartja Old) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglicas), Nobel Peace Prize won by Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Literature Award winner Mario Vargas Llosa (Marius Vargas Liosa).
"We encourage good will leaders in all countries to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can take decisions on the basis of facts," the group report says.
They argue that "the global area of information and communications" is a common good, which "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views".
"People have a fundamental right to obtain information which is freely collected, processed and distributed on the basis of the truth of the commitment, the principles of pluralism of views and the rational methods of determining facts," the authors added.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including President Donald Trump (Donald Trump), who often criticises "unreal news", but who is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when they will meet on November 11-13 in Paris, the Peace Forum, called on the signatories.
This declaration was prepared within two months, under the direction of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloi (Christophe Delwari), the Head of the Media Freedom and Journalist Rights Protection Organisation, located in Paris, "Reporters Without Borders" (RSF).
Among the other signatories are former President of Senegal Abdou Dioufas (Abdu Diufas), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and politician Francis Fukuyama (France).
Seimas confirmed higher penalties for harmful products
The Seimas agreed with the amendments to the Product Safety Act providing that penalties for product safety violations should be increased.
The sitting room was adopted unanimously.
As Mr Antanas Winkus, member of the Seimas Health Committee, said on the new project, welcomes the promotion of objectives related to better consumer protection of products.
Its provisions are also compatible with the requirements of the European Parliament and of the Council Decision.
"My head, the proposed draft law, is better and more specific for all actors involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current criminal system does not always prevent further violations because the entities who have paid the fine continue to commit repeated violations," said Mr. Winkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals after the Government's approval.
The legislative amendments aim at increasing penalties for infringements, strengthening the protection of consumer rights, providing more power to market surveillance authorities and creating a clear system of product safety requirements and compliance with them.
As the Ministry of Agriculture has said, producers are currently not obliged to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, the Ministry said that the market surveillance authorities were not granted the right to access the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises, and inspections, which made it difficult for the authorities to do so.
The Ministry's assessment, the time limit for the award of fines and warnings for six months, is too short to establish an infringement, to conduct an investigation and to appoint a penalty.
Also, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly breach the requirements of the law - only during 2017 did so by 14 companies.
The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed that producers should be obliged to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability so that market surveillance authorities can be more easily informed about suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to access the premises, premises, to carry out inspections of operators producing, supplying products to the market.
The aim is to increase penalties for violations of the law.
For the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative of dangerous products placed on the market and for the distributor, their supplying market, the service provider would be awarded a penalty of EUR 150 to 2,500 (now EUR 144 to EUR 1448).
If the State Consumer Rights Authority (CPC) or other market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market of dangerous products and the provision of dangerous services, the fine of EUR 1 000 to EUR 5 000 (now EUR 868 to EUR 4 344) will be granted.
Without a requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them, the penalty would be EUR 2500 to 6,500 (now EUR 1,448 to 5,792).
If dangerous products have caused damage to the health of the consumer, the penalty would be EUR 2,500 to 15 000 (now EUR 1 448 to 11584).
If dangerous products resulted in the death of the consumer, the penalty would be EUR 6500 to 25 000 (now EUR 5 792 to EUR 23 169).
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, the infringement of product safety legislation is awarded up to EUR 25 000 (no minimum fine set), in Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600 000, in Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 6 666, in Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7500.
10-year-old child: a member of the family was kidnapped
The events that took place in Colombia have brought millions of people to the fore.
A ten - year - old girl who was raped by an older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby finds the world through the cesarean knife, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
For a time, they were cared for by doctors.
It's still going to take some time for the young mom and the kid to go home.
"On the basis of the information I received from the police officers, the minor became pregnant after she was sexually abused by a family member - a brother" - told one of the directors of the foreign hospital where the birth was taken.
Police are investigating the incident of kidnapping and violence against a child.
The Norwegian armed battalion participated in NATO's most distant and northern activities
The soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of difficult exercises in the mountains north of the country’s capital, Oslo.
It's part of NATO's Trishakak Association 2018 exercises - the largest NATO exercises since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion after the 11th of September spent a lot of time away from home, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in the warm countries.
But most of all, they are capable of fighting under the Arctic conditions, and these skills are very useful now that NATO changes its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinseta, often in the remotest and western areas, the soldiers participated in the staged battles against true British soldiers.
Soldiers have the ability to survive in this spring in the wild, but in the climate they have to try a lot more on their shoulders - one basket weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers in the leadership say they share their skills in survival and fighting under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the military, these practices, which, like any other, especially remind of real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

Clearly, this stage of my life has ended after Vygaud left the fight for further elections," said P. Mačiulis.
He said he regretted the decision to leave Kaunas' policy on support to Mr Usack, only regretting that "Lithuania lost the unique opportunity to have a true leader in the context of international relations".

"The damage caused by the accident caused a threat to the environment - people could stumble and hurt - so it was necessary to change it.
Stogels were no longer resistant to moisture, so they were harmful to the heritage," explained the director of the museum.
Will these pillars be similar to those that were centuries ago?
"All works are compatible with inheritance and other institutions," - Mr. Injured added the goal that the result would be as authentic as possible, but at the same time an important and practical side - the ladders must protect the values from moisture.
A universal solution has been chosen in dealing with inheritance.
Before that, the elements of the Kaunas castle had been covered in a soviet year, so they no longer had historical values," said Kaunas Museum's director in detail.
The contract of employment was signed on 2 October.
Work is expected to not last more than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is expected that it will be completed by the end of November," the director of the museum expected.

Eastern European Studies Centre for Cooperation with Two Marked U.S. "Smegen Centres"
According to Resc leader Lin Kojas, who has been in Vilnius for the past 30 years, the involvement of the United States will lead to the implementation of projects and will make Lithuania’s voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working this way for several months.
I am pleased that two large institutions see us as partners and look for opportunities for joint activities.
I am sure that niche activities will emerge, as we are looking at NATO, security, disinformation, the themes of the development of the Eastern Partnership States are also priority for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that the ESC and the US authorities will work together in the preparation of applications for international projects will be replaced by expert experience and knowledge, expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, since both partners have a great international reputation.
FPRI has been active since 1955 and has joined nearly a hundred top-level analysts.
At the latest University of Pennsylvania, in the World Analytical Centres rating FPRI took the seventh place in its category.
At the same time, CEPA, whose analysts were repeatedly invited to consult and work with the highest political institutions in the United States, ranks ten in the same rating.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the U.S. information space and encourage us to raise a quality card," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to assist partners in the distribution of the recently displayed ResSC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" between US decision-makers and public space.
The Eastern European Studies Centre operates on the basis of projects to be implemented and no targeted grants are maintained.
Among the ESC partners with joint initiatives are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
