What do you want to do next?
His name's Tom.
I can't believe your parents let you go here on your own.
Unfortunately, you have to go to Japan.
I'll give you some advice.
She seems to be getting sick.
I'm not sure yet.
Do you want something to eat?
What is your hope?
That'll certainly attract Tom's attention.
Ticket to the museum is worth $300.
Do you want something to eat?
I'm working in Tokyo now.
Tom eats alone every day.
Let's defend our marriage.
You're not busy now, are you?
This room has its AC.
Why didn't you help him?
I married when I was 19.
Didn't Tom really know how to cook?
Where's the supermarket around here?
Tom's hair's already broken.
Can I ask you something to drink?
I've done whatever I can.
Please wear your shoes.
Tom's always good to me.
Where did he want to go?
He's a DJ.
We shouldn't have told Tom.
Have you had dinner?
I was happy when I read.
Where do you live?
I want to learn your language.
I want to go have a drink.
When are you going?
Why can Taro speak English better than that?
Let's just do it now.
You're spreading lies.
What's wrong?
I expected you last night.
You just made me feel so happy.
Parents are usually very wise.
I was sleeping with Markus when he came.
I can't stab my right hand.
I'm hungry.
Yoko didn't answer my question.
Tom's very different from his father.
Like a father, like a child.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Tom's on the floor.
He's been a very good man lately.
He's from France.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
It's more valuable than gold.
I will be happy to help him.
Learning about foreign culture is fun.
When did you start wearing them?
Tom wouldn't like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to call us back.
Without hesitation, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnicity and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too thick until it can't be used to cut meat, I finally use my pocket knife.
His eyes are blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom was the forgetful.
Where are you?
The passing lamps are used to set the passing beams.
Don't let Tom see these photos.
This room got a little sunlight.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't have broken that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I'm getting tired of not being sober.
It smells so bad.
Words are words.
There is no god but Allah, and there is no Allah save Him, and there is no Allah's apostle.
I just found out yesterday.
You can buy it in the bookstore.
Let's get on the Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother likes music.
It's so easy to hang out with Tom.
You want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I think I can come this afternoon.
"It's no waste we've been waiting for two hours." "Yes, I'll keep this sign of my hand for the rest of my life."
Tom is one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's garlic.
You'll never find a way home, through a narrow stone road.
Tom really wasn't at home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
The guy's driving the car.
It's like a birthday card that's coming soon.
Please read it again.
When can you do that?
I'm just kidding.
Tom's almost there.
I'm leaving, too.
Love never goes wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost has already been paid for the professional service to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn the logo, do you?
Tom tried to trick Mary into helping her.
Two things are not involved.
How could I not be aware of this?
What's this supposed to be?
I'm still at home because the rain's coming down.
That is the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
To me, there was no fundamental difference between the culture of the two countries.
He's turning around.
Wake me up at eight o'clock.
Tell me why he didn't come.
That may have affected their decision.
It's raining all night long.
Tom's starting to be jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy this bag for you.
The cake's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Did you ever go to London?
It is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready yet.
Mary turned down the invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
He's sitting around his grandchildren.
The boy fell asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left.
He's focused on those puzzles.
The man died a few hours ago.
You want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We know that the front door is locked.
May I speak to Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is his acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We've got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying by plane.
I had assumed that he was lying, but that didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice, I have to do this.
I couldn’t finish reading this book in a week.
The choice of time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of supplies.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other options.
I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
In the eyes of our law all things are equal, but the rich at times have more advantage.
He must have made it.
I like cats.
It's almost over at nine.
Tom was mentally disturbed.
Could I be crazy?
We faced a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone's ever made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to.
My mother hasn't been here in ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, just you can't drive.
Can I see your coupon?
He looks serious to read.
Tom married a woman that's easier than he is.
He was a copy of his father's.
He has good words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself, but eventually he failed.
Do you have a light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I reincarnate, I want to be born again as a cat.
We get a lot of rain this summer.
He made an important scientific discovery.
He's a student.
Tom's already here, but Bill hasn't come yet.
Laurie slowly.
They suggest that she go alone.
Tom's a good man.
I'll call back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom like Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of students went to college.
Tom put the pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom shook his voice so that no one could hear him.
Did you see anything?
What are you looking at?
Did he take a long walk?
He greets her every morning, when she enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very steep, it's better off on the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
Her mother was worried about her son.
What's the opera showing at Lincoln Center right now?
I feel like I'm sick.
Tom was killed by Mary.
The data is often not accurate.
Get up!
We've ordered six to thirty-six.
We named that dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom signaled Mary to follow him.
It's been an hour.
I'm smarter than them.
It's getting darker.
I'm tired.
All who know him admire him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The car just left.
Those people are crazy!
