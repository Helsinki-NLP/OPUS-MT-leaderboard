No free novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted under a novelty of the Penal Code.
The new regime, which could have paved the way for the release of the Ministry ofExperts arrested, rejected the honourable Members when the second reading of the application for the abolition of fines for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October because of the conclusion of an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet legal, and in December the appeal of the defendants is to be brought before the Court.
Timoshenko himself referred to the judgment as the political root of the regime, and even in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the primacy of the court.
The application, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister ofExperts was convicted of being removed from the Penal Code was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for his adoption.
Libyan Dinar
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual, this region prevails in the election of Islamists, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical ones.
The National Transitional Council was known as the ordinary law of the Shariʹa, from which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft, you'll have to cut your hand short.
Women too should forget to think of emancipation as quickly as possible, be guided by any misconception, and so forth.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by each other from the Koran.
In a short time - in Libya, an order will prevail, which would hardly be predictable and, above all, hardly be desirable to this country.
Only - our lifestyle is now not the only and objective view, perhaps not the best and would hardly suit the mentioned Libyans.
So it is rather surprising that the Muslim fighters were allowed to help themselves by the faithless dogs at all.
Their apology may only be the fact that NATO's air attacks were not directed by any general in America, but by God himself, whose power was celebrated after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya, the West isn't one of them.
We took part only in a change of movement, served the interests of Islam and our politicians separated in the person of the dictator of a political alliance without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer to look away from a Libyan military occupation.
As a result, the lifts are a concern - that is, the distribution of the cruisers.
But do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at the spot price without an occupation?
The West can hardly even boast itself once with the right of its independence in matters of the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Sharai`a representatives.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe focus on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated in comparison to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
But today, the bond market is breaking up with all the records.
The investors not only keep Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries in view.
The statistical offices of the European area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5% from France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded a higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France had a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated, according to Tsch. Statistical Office confirmed the trend of slowing growth in economic performance.
So the results are worse than the analyst's predictions.
The most important events:
However, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, compared with the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcrowded data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, between July and September, the economy recorded a growth of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds was 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish State bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also start to feel problems...
The return on Czech state bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, votes will be cast, and the ECB will become a believer in the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well placed Torwart Czech and a wonderful tower by Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football could defend its luxurious advantage from home play and will again not fail at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed up the game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a giant portion luck in the second.
The Czech selection was also successful thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro quite happy 1:0 and has thus redeemed her ticket for the football-EM.
Also because of the precise defense of the Czech team, they were able to put the Montenegrins under pressure only in the second half of the year.
The peach birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant odds.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech election will be accompanied next year by the European Championships, and it is also pleased that the home football will win a prize of about 200 million.
From the first minute on, it was played quite combat football.
Both teams were combined for a long time and were played mainly around the centre line.
Also in the second half of the year, the pressure of the home team remained strong and the far-reaching closures prior to the persecution were successfully rejected by the Czech resistance.
Iranian students are willing to die for the core programme of their country.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of high school students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Iran in Isfahan formed a living shield around the core technology centre in Isfahan, which is processed in uranium on Tuesday.
So they wanted to make sure that they were ready to protect their country's core programme, even if it was necessary to protect them with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran has apparently not given up any nuclear weapons in its efforts.
In Israel too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed in the middle of the afternoon before entering the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack carried out in the intention to put the Iranian nuclear programme to a large extent, the Israeli press, according to the Isfahan centre, would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's attack target.
The food card of a fat-sucking child: It doesn't breakfast and eats for breakfast
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 per cent of all students and 5 per cent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys show - adipic children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again it shows how important it is for a healthy person to develop the environment in which he grows and the examples that surround him.
The tables of adipose children are more common than in families where normal children live up to half the time.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had the morning of the clarification action under the motto "Adipositionas is not a coincidence" of Pommes for the evening break.
In families with Dickers, sport is not just about the favorite jobs, but also about the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active movement.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year against the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools being surveyed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second anniversary of the action "Adipositionas is not a coincidence", supported by the General Hospital and the Society Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unsanitary costs and lack of movement within the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the fearsome increase in the number of children with overweight or even fat.
"Only half of the children questioned started eating, for example, five times a day, in the mode of breakfast-second breakfast lunch-vesper dinner - one of the main requirements for healthy food," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and toast for the evening break
Experts point out that also relative minorities, such as regular family breakfast, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the families of the students enjoy breakfast.
And - in most families everyone enjoys for themselves.
The worst was the finding that is not even frozen in every ten families.
The breakfast is considered as the foundation of healthy daily food.
The survey showed, among other things, the day that children who are overweight are often consumed with unhealthy potatoes in their families.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the surveyed children are driving sports, only less than half of their parents do - that is, only 15 percent.
Locate Your Own Menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own food plan from the possibilities offered after appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in a food point is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many flours, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
"The great popularity of sweet lemonades is alarming in particular," the final report stresses this survey.
In the middle of the day, so to the main court, tenig goods were barely in front of birds.
The children almost didn't like chicken fruit, and also the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunches was very low.
Health Recycling
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are ready to change their eating habits when they receive correct information.
"In many cases, there was a clear shift in the preferences to the principles of healthy nutrition in the context of the survey group, which completed the questionnaires following the conclusion of the clear presentation "Adipositionas is not an accident", the results of the project are indicated.
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed a lot of frequent birds or fish as the main course of the day and were ready to eat less Nodes or sweet foods.
Profis claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had noticed that this was a bit too much substance for the beginning.
I didn't realize what was going on.
Presentations by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how this is "on-site".
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the test is coming, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully documented.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (on the course no one man participates) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportional figure.
And yet most of us are.
They have one too short neck, the other one too young figure without proper curves and others are soft again.
It is the thing of the stylist to cast wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or to exorcise the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to draw a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with large buses, wide hips and narrow waists - nice and face-to-face, without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really do not fit, at least one piece should be cut to size.
This is certainly not to be regretted, for good sitting clothes are simply unpayable.
In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in one of the bars, which is always too high- and distorted, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can also be allowed to wear clothing with folds, constructions, applications, stickers or shaves.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible to create it because of the homework set up.
Each of the participants was awarded a prom for which they should think about appropriate outfits - day clothing and avendrobe.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the appropriate star and its type of figure.
I'm supposed to bring Miranda Kerr, who may know you from Victoria's secret campaign.
I am delighted inside, because this is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who in recent times may have increased to the hundred kilos (after well, this is a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut the clothes from magazines or search, print and then graphically edit them on the Internet.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also forms the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific default, for example trend handbags, mäntel, etc.).
The designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's only on Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday presentation, filled with information about types of figures, was cut off by three visitors from the sector:
by Stylist Jan Pokorny, by fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that Mode Illusion is and that a stylist should be able to use this.
And sent-in stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in a completely different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a drink coat like usual over the jeans, so like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to raise the sleeve or the collar and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with that," he stressed.
Mostly, however, I found the following advice: "You must first know the rules perfectly."
"You may hurt her first," said Jacob.
Finally, I find out why we have to break all these lessons, what you can combine with, and why, even if you often get to see in fashion journals completely different.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing options than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories looks completely different from in reality.
So with all this, you have to count on the design of the outfit.
That the image and style were half the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorny.
There you only need Madonna to see a not just brilliant singer made from the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also known personalities often hold this for money cast out (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is secondary).
And if one of us is allowed to style, then we should assume that he or she is very likely to force us to a completely different size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to gloat to make sure that the Boulevard press writes, the corresponding Promi has returned or withdrawn, etc.
Jan and Mario encouraged us on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist just focused on fashion and then the outfit needs to "couple".
In his work, he must communicate with the people he stylizes, and he must be a skilled psychologist.
Estimates people without offering themselves and standing in his opinion.
"If we are ordered by any manager to look at their wardrobe and add nice pieces, then we can't clear the whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You need to find at least a few of the things that you recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us very concrete what such a so-called "plattsche" must include.
So this is a bag you pick up on the waist and where you carry all the necessary properties.
In addition to such clear things as scars, hair removal rollers or safety needles, they also contain tools such as nylon thread (which helps the stylist in photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the garment is pulled back if it is too large (stick needles or other adhesives are prohibited so that the fabric is not cut off) and of course nutrient.
But in order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to put shoes right.
Also when photographing in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe, bend the outside.
We stick and we stick...
With the scarf, you can't even touch the shoes so you don't hurt them.
So you really have to go ahead with it.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without any restrictions.
This skill is not exactly my strength.
All this was just the fraction of what we got at the second weekend continuation course.
One has now become clear to me - to devote yourself to the styling on a professional level, is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original care-free ride will result in a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors for routine journeys to the breakfast level.
Although it has been achieved to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what benefit has it already if obviously no one wanted to do a little more?
Before he came to the shop, the new part with the sub-title "The Run" raised high expectations.
However, he promised that the old series "Need for Speed" again would move a piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not actually appear to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the custom passports came out, in which the main protagonist rises from the car and goes on foot.
But as you're used to NFS, it's in the end effect a lot different than you expected.
Sure - potentially there are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is shaped by some excess errors that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's not really a mistake anymore, but rather a sign of an incomprehensible failure of the game developers in principle.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, it is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal competition across America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is spent on another course and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment to think that the game would offer the same again and again.
Some environments are still very nice to see, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So there's no world movement.
But the journey through the desert, through eastern landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape seems very pleasant.
Untypical elements bring a little difference in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the view.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be swept away by a Lavine.
In addition, the individual races are well built together.
Just a few, but they're rich.
For a while you try to get the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classic race against the stop clock), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are still involved in this. They want to get the whole thing mixed up.
A novelty is passports where Jack leaves the car.
It's more about certain interactive animations where Jack runs in front of someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that in the game there are much less such passports than one would expect (concretely only three).
Finally, this is more of a benefit, because this element has at least no chance to become boring - it is part of the above-mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The model runs in the feet of the previous parts.
That means, from today's point of view, it doesn't get out of trees, on the other hand, you couldn't say it would be bad.
Whoever's looking for realistic simulations has to take care of himself.
But an action-loaded race will continue to be well-equipped, although competition could be better.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only arise after some time.
In contrast to the vehicle model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected that it calculates complicated distortions and collisions, but if you don't have an idea about how the car behaves, it's obviously not all right.
Typical example: In the case of narrow overcrowding or prefabricating in the opposite cars, you "run" in some places the other cars just slightly, in others, but you get to the shoulders and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car goes straight to scratch.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, it's all out of anger.
The restarts are solved as follows: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then throw one the game back to the last stop of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
If you've exhausted it, it's all going to go away.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work, but you shouldn't leave it behind.
Sometimes, however, it doesn't even help the restart, because it doesn't help anything other than learning the critical section from the head.
It is highly unacceptable that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves need to be run in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not pass through.
Otherwise, at the appropriate place, you meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you come as first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent passes before a player on two matching cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to walk them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is so designed that it always comes close to this situation before your nose.
The contractors still have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where one is always taken over at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
The crazyst thing is this is to finish the game on the long bridge that happens in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get one out here obviously on the devil.
And if he's already in front of one, then he'll naturally take a look, so you'll start driving your own car a few times in a klump.
Of course - you want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it loses a quick joy in the game.
And that's bad, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is all quite entertaining and apparently also loaded so that you almost don't know where one of the heads is.
And in principle, what's wrong with it is the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can't happen for a long time, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the race.
You can't ignore the tanks on the track, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super-sport cars for the technical journeys, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of play history also goes the task mode (requirements) - that is, the races in the different locations you know from history.
There are not only medals here, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is shared for the tasks (your challenges) and history.
To reach the higher driver level, various items need to be opened: from the car to the background for the profile.
This is connected to the online autolog function, which compares, among other things, the results achieved with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible scissors is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come with the car into a subway tunnel (my roads), where you can go in the dark on the rails (my roads).
On the tacho, you can see numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (roads of mine), but there comes a subway from the back and leads an uncompromising road to scrape.
In our editorial we'll probably be arguing for a long time about whether it was a blackout of the gamemakers or whether the authors kept us so bloody.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
It's so much more angry that at some exciting moments, the frequency of video playback is slowed down and this is, among other things, rather dramatic.
However, this concerns, in particular, accidents involving a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit at all.
The audio playback is so much OK and the soundtrack is tasteful.
In an effort to address as wide as only possible scales of younger audiences, a soundtrack a à la "everything" was created - but who buys such a game already because of music?!
The total impression of Need for Speed: The Run? Feelings are more mixed.
If the game didn't come up with the total unnecessary errors mentioned, we could have claimed with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems to be incomplete.
A class of pleasure for yourself, but one should be prepared to look at one of these mistakes with the power of airport lights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions feel safe."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five, six years until the roads are smoothed and everyone has become accustomed to their new role," said Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite briefly, in her speech at the Faculty of Law.
As she took the term "understanding and open about Europe", she already showed in the first part of her talk, in which she managed to describe the individual bodies of the EU and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that she could have benefited so many of the lecturers of the Faculty of Law at Karls University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new Permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism was voiced that he was too incapacitated - a grey official who had not grown such a role, but I have to say, it has struck all the breath as well as he assumed the thing.
"He is a man who is ready to listen patiently to seven twenty Member States, communicate with them, and has clear ideas about how to move on with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", so as an important step to agree and improve the readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our oil mill Quargel
Ms Vicenová also dedicated himself to the agenda that the European Union lived, lived and remembered in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago referred to it as success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the presidency was described as a major negative which had greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all the hands to do.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis that has not yet been overcome.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which is making it much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether there will be a sleek and saving budget, which will give industry priority, which countries will be more and less promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "I understand Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's green shorts, foreign words and professionals who don't understand anyone.
How am I supposed to know as a citizen whether you really want to ban the neighborhood in Brussels or round gorges and various big bananas?
It would also have liked to use the EU soil to obtain more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics, who are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in the European institutions is much more angry.
Many factors are due, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also raised the strength and cooperation of the Visagrad Group, which is V4.
"Believe me when a Pole or Hungary comes to me and a Slovak is near, then the French next to me says, "Hey, what are you doing with your heads together - that's your V4 again?" and making it a pretty acidic mine.
According to Ms Vicenévé, in the future, the EU is expected, above all, to have strict rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As much more real than a "European federation" it looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only the countries should cooperate who want it and those who don't want it should stand still."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong "Europe of different speeds", says Mrs Vicenová.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in implementing the principle, according to all the issues affecting the whole EU of all Member States and not only the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM is the most accurate one, then this would be the word "longevity".
For the general public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although it has been established for a century.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by her first head - visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Once he presented the slogan, countless world problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a brand to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis for the fundamentally prepared company culture of Watson.
"For us from IBM this long-term thought means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore a success for a whole century because its principles remained faithful and did not hesitate to change everything else.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society in the course of the first century.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company for the anniversary.
Translucent system
Watson has been operating in the thirty years social care of his employees - in a way similar to that of the IBM company in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had a paid holiday as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as a workwear and a well thought-out remuneration system for the best new people and traders.
The long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are also elusive.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide raised any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan is replaced by a woman at the top of IBM next year - by Virginia Rometti.
It has been with IBM for thirty years, so far it has taken up the position of the Veterinium, Marketing and Strategy Chief.
In recent years IBM has made so-called online brainstormings, many of which have grown up in future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company is almost half a million people employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unfavourable position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and the outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology," added George Colony of Consulting Company Forrester Research.
As the company himself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of the family name "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns most patents and has already been awarded the Nobel Prize to five of its employees.
Its most well-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, comic code or the diskette.
With about 220 billion dollars stock exchange value (market capitalisation), IBM was the second largest technology company (even after Apple) this year, with Microsoft being acquired for the first time since 1996.
Foreseeing
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were for example the experiment with your own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not get emotionally involved in the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its base walls on different platforms - and if they don't work, leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Successful technologies
The gains of IBM are mainly involved in services, software and hardware involved in one fifth each.
In 1990 hardware was represented by the strongest proportion of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-making assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested 58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
In these investments IBM continues even after 2008, when the recent financial crisis first hits like a storm around the world.
Here too IBM remained faithful to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume in the middle of the global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives the current crisis undamaged.
The value of the IBM shares increased by 120 per cent since 2008 and the company's profit continues to grow continuously.
The company log of IBM says: everything can change - just not the values.
That is why this flexible giant can be expected to win the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutters to global flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded hundreds of years ago had a fairly complicated name - Computing Tableling Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took it only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They own technologies such as the famous card clocks for recording the start and end of work.
The architects of this new company were Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the Supervisory Board by 1930.
And it was Flint who set up the head of the competition firm Thomas J. Watson to help him in the management of the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM into the shadows - based on Watson's ideas, the unbeatable culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name has already betrayed, with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cuttings, to cassettes.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded to and beyond all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then he was dissolved by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under this direction IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM's technicians and computers of NASA helped fly to all - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that defined the computer standard at that time came into the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus became fully involved in the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet.
It is intended to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, for example to improve traffic and urban management.
In the trade sector IBM recently launched the Smarter Trade platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932 IBM established a settlement in the then Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a world-wide top research team dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Richtářová about her unfaithful cats:
Iveta - this ass you can keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband, Josef Richtář (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), became their lover, Darina still had the hope that Joseph would be brought home from his rosary dream.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life it has made clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner," explained D. Rightářová.
When Darina Rightářová of the singer I. Bartošová had offered refuge in her own house, you would probably not even fall into the dream, as with her husband.
When Iveta pushed her back and forth after 30 days to Ríčany, Joseph went with her.
Yes, he even known the public that he loved her.
In time, Darina resignated, yes, it seemed even as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytář is no matter who his wife sleeps with
If Richtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly receive no open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, confused old ass, but as a man to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rightářová; she also said that she had already been emotionally separated from him and was alone on mutual consent.
The fact that Darina has locked his back door to him, Joseph still bears honor.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, it doesn't change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I normally entertain myself, only the bed we don't share," said J. Richtář (the leaf).
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he doesn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take every responsibility.
The worst of women's faults: How are you?
If the men are asked to name some typical female faults, then they unravel a few prompts out of the sleeve.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we let a few unsatisfied reviews happen again, which let men shed blood in the Hells?
Search for purchases
Do you expect them to be greedy?
Do you have to buy at least one hat weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and can there be a little more in action?
Then, in your case, it's really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of it and try to keep their shopping half way under control.
But hand on heart, which woman already insists on looking for a well-sitting upper dress just to bump through a dress shop and not to try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though buying for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Just think of them as often as they told her husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"I had to lose at least five kilos - should I start to jog or do gymnastics?"
"Can I ever do anything to you?"
Does this seem familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you're probably also among the women who regularly have what they look like.
This does not mean that you should be allowed to go, but many men react allergicly when their wife constantly regrets her appearance.
The stronger gender is agreed - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly inconvenient.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, tear the tubs - and this at least twice a week.
Jump with her partner, because once again he tramps with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, turn the kids off, because the just covered washbasin is already dirty again and because the glass at the living room already has fingerprints again, but where does the polishing make so much effort?
If you suffer under this kind of "deviant", then you should know that you must not exceed anything and the order and cleanliness in family life are not at the top.
Finally, this immeasurable purity pen can also damage the mutual relations and, above all, the peace of the family.
Sketch
"Descending tournaments come into the sink."
"Would you really like to pull the old socks again tomorrow?"
"We don't just throw a towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tyranny, you should not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, that's not bad, but they just want everything that's in order.
If the men knew that, then the women might not need to mutilate so much.
Klatsch and Tratsch
Some women are happy to bleat and wet, then they are torn behind their back or even thrown away, or they are smearing alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to get through such topics as, for example, who, where, with whom, how and why.
Although each of us has a bit of a shamless claw and tratsch in the camp.
Hands on your heart - that's probably all women's own.
However, this is not to be confused with the most precious calibers, of which nothing and no one is holy, who are likely to curse everyone in their surroundings and who are particularly at risk for women's collectives.
Jagr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistance to win
The ice hockey storm Jaromír Jagr had a large share of the NHL on Monday with two assistances at the 5:3rd victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who added another assistance and was called out to the best player of the game, was a user of the review of the nine thirty-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assists in the same game also listed Jagr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
Jagr claimed after the game journalists against him, he had Giroux a great evening prophecy.
"Before the game, I'm telling him he's been hit by a hate trick today."
I felt that somehow."
"He and again overcomes such a feeling," Jagr explained, after which Giroux already reached a gate at the first shot of the pilots.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech trace".
Voráček won the puck behind the gate of Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third's aftiff, home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short hand, but the second third belonged to the flyer again.
It's specifically Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he achieved his third hit, then Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player of the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jagr praised his center.
"I wouldn't like life to play with such an ice hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm so glad."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my associates put their game on me and now the spear is turning around," jammed Jagr.
Carolina still played the drama - through the hit of Tuoma Routua and once again Dwyer, who was suffering from a gunfight, came to a door.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication, in which he was in too many two against one success.
"Excellently acted proger still in our area."
"He got the puck, I took the ride up and (read) pulled to further steps."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it's hit," Voráček described the party's last hit from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia joined the summit of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech opponent of Montreal Jaroslav Šparek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and separated in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candys, in addition to their experience, also offered Beck their leadership an unforgivable lead in the Penalty Shooting 2:3.
One of the penalties could not be changed by Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points hurt the trainer of the home team probably the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five opponents at the end.
"That's bad."
"The encounter we only played with one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do, so we have to finish," said Jacques Martin.
"At any turn a wave of attack after the other and we had nothing to do with it."
"We would have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
There were also reservations," said P. K. Subban, one of the opponents.
The Czech Torhüter Ondřej Pavelec fired thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended up a series of five defeats, five different shields had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel offices in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Car Tourist.
At the time, the travel offices sold mainly travels to the Socialist Eastern blocs, in the West only selected at that time.
And so Czech tourists travel to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotchi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when they were allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a protest course and therefore the travels to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries of the Eastern bloc (so also the Czechoslovaks).
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel to Poland individually or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Since then, the travel offices also offered trips to the west, but had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel office, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel office.
And so the thing hasn't been going on for a long time.
The so-called currency issue - the condition for an exit to the West - was only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without currency usage it would have been impossible to drive the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holiday in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekly houses and dots - a habit that continues to this day.
The current revolution of 1989 followed a re-evolution of the Czechs on foot.
While by 1989 a holiday in the DDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A powerful paradox, which you no longer realize today, is the fact that you could not travel in the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the foreign exchange obligation has been lifted in the neighbouring Western European countries, leading to a strong wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough time from their trip to the West, each wanted to be there for at least a few days.
This is how the Czech holidaymakers slept in the tent in Paris in the park, since at the time, they had the money for a stay in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature of foreign travel by Czechs was then one with canned, beer and permanent wort, etc. packed suitcase.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely interchangeable Czech Krone - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency free.
Our standard of living and this has also increased the averages, which took place in 1997 at another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to prepare regular trips after 1997 through charter flights, thereby allowing flight flights to deal with quantities discounts which were incredibly approved in comparison to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had a foreign exchange-free movement with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post office" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying each year in distant sunny countries; this year they fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch, which marked our "postrevolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, thus definitely entering our country among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 TZK per head for a single holiday stay including the cost of the holiday place.
The main meeting is to find a new president - a pact again threatens.
For almost five months now, the Czech football has no president and threatens that the successor of Ivan Haszek will not be known at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymburg.
There is still no agreement on which electoral order to be chosen.
And without it, there is no vote on the three potential successors at all.
Three stakeholders want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paklík.
In June, Haszek withdrew from his function, urging his colleagues to join in the retreat and find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era of Haszek - did the old Querells break out between the two chambers of association, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This proved to be sharp and clear on 16 September when the new president should be elected.
The delegates of the main meeting came to the People's House in Prague in the district of Smíchov, for the negotiations led to no results and not only to the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote at the meeting - only the statutory representatives or also the officials equipped with a full power.
In this single point, at least part of the agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion was not held on the basis of a representation on the basis of full power.
However, disputes over the electoral order continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee give any further clarification at its meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the views on the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in round 3 in order to avoid a pact situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of FAČR's three vice-chairmen representing the professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate receives higher percentage support in the chamber for which he is candidate.
Mähren is allegedly willing to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, on the other hand, is on the condition that the winner receives at least one second of the majority in this percentage vote.
"Then the two prefaces no longer have any meaning, this mode would question the whole two-room concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the sea side, which was best placed not to bend the electoral order, but to choose a valid statute.
Tomáš Paklík agrees with this, even if it turns out that the constitutional electoral order of all the candidates will be opposed to the very first Pelta.
"My wish is that most of the time is chosen after the constitution."
"In order not to be considered foolish replacements, as at the last main meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time applied and in his opinions limited himself above all to Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his view, the new president will be known in Nymbruk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football-EM this day would certainly contribute to the reconciliation of the hostages."
"If the football only rides on the euphoria wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience from all three fans, both at professional and regional level.
Rijkl's more intrusive.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of bows and pearls, but there are certain efforts to "correct" the rules for their own purposes."
"That is why a re-blocking at the main meeting is not excluded."
"But I hope that the healthy human mind will finally win," said Rachel.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides will not remain.
Some negotiations should probably play directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete until the qualification game.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rijkl were supposed to fly to Podgorica, could not start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance, and so they were searching for a replacement variant, but how to bring a part of the executive committee to the site of the barrag.
Finally, I think it is crucial that the meeting be held at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to move the split parties within the country's largest sports association.
It is a great deal at stake: state grants, the trustworthiness of the Czech football and also the upcoming main meeting of the ČSTV, which will show the new direction to the Czech sports according to the financial problems of Sazka.
Paklík is fighting for the president's position because he doesn't see any suitable candidates.
If Tomáš Paclík, the leader of the Pilsner Footballer before the Extraordinary General Assembly could have formed a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Republic Football Federation (FAČR), he would not have been in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good advocate, I would fight for him and refuse to vote."
"But in the present situation, it was not possible to find such an appetite," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Reichl is to prevent the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta, to the top of the FAČR.
Paklík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he will remember the President's function for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the proper meeting of the General Assembly.
In the chair's position, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager who is not too much stuck in the football game.
"I have spoken to some people in question."
"I hardly think some of them told me they didn't want to identify with the Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disrupts the Pelta's association with the President of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, who is regarded behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegates to major meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paklík to have Pelta's position as president.
"In his victory, the present state would be preserved and in Czech football it would not go forward at all."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, fights football twice bad," Paklík stressed.
He also points out that Pelta's name was found in a corruption case a while ago in connection with telephone hearings, but that Pelta was penalized.
"I don't know which prestige should bring a victory from Pelta to the football."
"And how would we be there in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paklík, who said his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner Football Club if Pelta is president", but he sees something more looser.
However, if Paclík wins in Thursday's election, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate, Rajchl, who had supported the Paclík before the main meeting in October, ended with a Fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the union as a manager."
"But I don't have my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who had taken care of that in September, that he stood behind the appeal of the panel of judges with Luděk Macela at the top of which Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík himself claims that he feels that the role of the chairman of the association has grown.
And he relys on his abilities in leading private companies, since last summer he is also head of Pilsen, who with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the League.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to some cultivation of this."
"To limit the influence of certain groups of interests, which tend to influence disciplinary and disciplinary commissions, as is the case in opposing situations", Paklík pointed out that he did not make a pit from his antipathy, for example, against the chief of Sparta, Daniel Kretínský.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby the political top politicians for more money from the lottery tax in sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new president should be committed to."
"If it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to cut and clear where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club is also not seen as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the president of the FAČR should be "over-partial".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rachel to the Prague Dukla.
"It's not exactly perfect."
"But it doesn't make much sense, in my opinion, to transfer my shares to a third party in Pilsner Club in order to return after another half year," said Paklík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will trigger a pact situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates promised for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, he will make sure in his election that the FAČR will receive new statutes, which in the future exclude disputes over the electoral order from the front.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday's negotiations in Nymbruck, and believes that the election will certainly get out of hand with a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to focus in the case of his election on the national team and the acquisition of funds.
He first decided to participate in the election before the last main meeting and thus wanted to help him pause two months to defend his ideas about leading the football and to present his ideas in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time that the association is led by someone, the man who is primarily associated with the Jabloneser Club, who also acted on Sparta and the Executive Committee for many years.
That is why he thinks he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that for today's problems with the election, the euphoria that ruled at the time of Ivan Haszek is responsible.
"Leaders were approved at the June General Assembly, which were not as perfect as they all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a president from September," Pelta said.
In particular, he used the revision of the main document of the Civilian Association as a means of closing the delegates.
"If I become chairman, then I will accept it personally and I am prepared to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"That's a basic thing without which he can't be," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his opponents.
Earlier, he had announced that he could present himself with Jindřich Reichl, who he recognized for his legal education and knew well that his opponent would be his first representative.
Even Tomáš Paklík did not attack for long, which did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He's been moving in football for over a year and can already refer to some success."
"His attacks, however, were indisposed, and many people were shocked by his campaign."
"That is why many doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest classes of the game, to the national team.
And this should be the sign of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the cause of the Bohemian, to the remnants of the corruption scandal last year."
"Just after that, I would rush to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure adequate funding for the whole football," said the six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry to the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleansing.
"I had to be familiar with the work content of all employees first," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, nervousness is understandable.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the upcoming main meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburg anyway on Thursday.
"If it really should be the only controversial point, as you choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his career.
Rijkl promises that the FAČR begins to work hard under him
If the former vice-president Jindřich Reichl was to be elected as the new president of the Czech Republic Football Association at the main meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly avoid many people in the association.
Rijkl promises to start working hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football, and otherwise to continue the work started by former president Ivan Haszek.
"As president, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Started from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through national selection, professional football, to the performance football for young people."
"That's why I don't want to say that I want to do everything by myself," said Rijkl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore would like to distribute the competences within the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football will take place in every segment with miles."
Many would not be satisfied with this because instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves now," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered not to run anymore.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don't gnaw a knot between my legs and any step I'm going to question," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"Many people, however, told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
Apparently, he is also motivated to continue the work he has begun under Haszek.
"In two years we've handled a lot of work and I don't want to just throw it away."
"Proceedings have been launched, which will probably only come into effect in a few years and I would only see worse that someone stopped them," he said and expressed his concerns in this way that in the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return in the days before Haszek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"He is behind him, above all, people who would make the football so that he would only be there for the chosen."
I may be able to challenge some, but not that I would be partial."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then it's all good and not just the chosen," said Rachel.
He also opposes the claim that he is only a Czech president.
"Even though some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best for pearls."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a matrimonial part, whose winners then rise to the first league."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three matrimonial clubs play in the league, which is especially a problem for the young players in the seas," says Rijkl.
Now that the leader of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paklík has joined in the fight for the role of the president, Rachel does not trust to estimate his chances of being elected.
"I seek strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to be its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rijkl, who also sees the savings of ten million crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the Lotteries Act as his success.
On the other hand, he partly owes himself to the fact that the union does not draw on a single string.
While he says of Pelta, "he is previously disqualified from helping the Czech football to new confidence", he holds the second rival - Paklík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Haszek started and would obviously not change the staffing of the Commission."
He would certainly not want to turn things aside from his interests," explains Rijkl over his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump to Blue
From Julia Stanek
Planchbecks in Ufo-Optic, Prunkpools in Budapest: Anyone traveling through Europe can experience its blue wonders - and after a tour of town or hiking the tired legs in spasms.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip in the past half year, one in her luggage would not be missing: her bath suit.
Back on the water, she looked high in artificially shaped dolls, they swam across marble-puttes waiting on them on the shore of the basin, and stood over acclibly restored young swimming pools.
If she liked a bathroom, she picked it up quickly in her notebook - as well as valuable details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 swimming pools explored Architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents in her recently published book "Bade joys": folk swimming halls in Munich, historic swimming pools in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
With sport they don't have much on the hat, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
It's just that swimmers need to find blue tiles and chlorgestank, while jogger can breathe the disturbing scent of fat foresters or happy bird changers in the park.
"I asked myself one day why swimming pools should always be so ugly," says the lake living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface double architecture
Placers in the spring basin and essential sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large, because all senses are handled, as Meder.
And when the builders have worked hard, the swimming pools can be a true eyebrows: "In the state of a floor there is a water surface in the baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other, it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles optically: high welds, colored tiles, springboards.
The dress-in-the-art band "Badefeuden" conveys on 190 pages the value of knowledge about the history of architecture and culture of historical wellness oasis - but, above all, makes a leap into the blue.
Notable examples were discovered by the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a urinal carnival (Höhlenbad in Miscolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Váriosios Termálfördö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoors in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in sight from Züricher Dachbad, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in St. Anton in the outdoor pool - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can see the driving on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits bath guests in Langenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three to the top open bowls it steams in the winter, while in the background the mountains of Ostetal reach the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector took the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths are smoking at Schwefel, in the Arpád bath in the Hungarian Békessaba, it smells so strongly that it is hardly believed to be landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrocarbon-containing helical water, which is almost black and its slick glues one to the skin, as soon as you let yourself into the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathrooms: When she wanted to visit the free and sunny bathroom in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrace.
The bath, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, was now closed.
When the lake cast a glance through the shaded windows of the red-white-yellow young-style building, she saw how uncooked among the tiles.
On the other hand, the fall has taken place in a magnificent swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three steps have already been behind this bathroom; you can discover not only neo-romanic elements from the times of its creation in 1844, but also a maurice hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of the pool Kenner Iris Meder - and not just because it comes from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to blend so many components into such a great unity," says Meder.
At such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is obviously only a side effect.
Agra-Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets the raw material business light up
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the Group Manager wants to draw on the consequences.
Hamburg -
The case is clear for the Germans: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents are asking the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to get out of this business because it increases the problems of the world's poor.
This is the result of a Forsa inquiry on behalf of the Consumer Organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that the laws on global commodity exchanges drive prices up - and therefore the banks are guilty of global hunger problems.
The consumer campaign is specifically directed at the German bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similar.
Originally, raw materials laws were intended to ensure traders against price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that the sugars have been disconnected from supply and demand - and make the most of the benefits.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the proposals and said that no business was "value to put the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank on the line".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the projections from the Foodwatch report.
Until the end of the year the examination will be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of the German Bank - as well as a recommendation on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the bank wants to report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete return.
Ackermann based on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The laws on rising food prices are particularly drastic in the way banks today do harm the general good."
Ackermann is now the senior bank lobbyist in particular.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all installations from its portfolio, in which money is used for food prices for legal purposes," Bode said.
"Whether it is Mr. Ackermann who suffers from hunger or the calling of the German Bank."
Ackermann's insight comes at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the Group Manager wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief of Staff would not change to the Supervisory Board otherwise than planned.
With a twist from the controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to be able to do so, he hardly needs to cut himself apart - so that his followers would eventually have to do it.
Any second would cancel raw materials plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager up.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa consulted on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Thus, only eleven percent consider it legitimate for the Deutsche Bank to offer facilities at which food prices are set.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such business: each second, the survey would announce all the facilities in which money flows into raw material speculation.
43% would have been robbed by such a bank, 49% would have given up thinking about cancelling their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The surrounded Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depth and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 was awarded prizes, was awarded in Vienna to the museum, stood empty and stolen.
He is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When heated by modern post-war architecture, by clear shapes, glossy halls, courageous swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958.
Schwanzers Pavilon then got the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel glass construction.
The building is still regarded as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made architects so known that he built Pavilon at the next world exhibition in Austria.
With its legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus stunning additions in Munich, he was finally internationally famous in 1973.
Pavilon, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been refurbished, refurbished, and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20th House" was named after the exhibition in the Swiss garden.
The building was suitable but not spacious and technically as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long that the contemporary art in Vienna came to a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come down more and more.
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now rebuilt the Pavilion, now called "the 21st House", and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, which belongs to the house, opens the first exhibition - a chance in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, who promoted art historians with remarkable careers, among other things in the youth as an ice-cream runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founder of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, put through the reconstruction with politicians and thinkers, she obtained public funds and private sponsors and determined the use.
Besides contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same foundation, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built for this.
Strict supervision, small state
Krischanitz was the ideal occupation for the implementation.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was a "unheavy important place" for him, where he had watched the exhibitions "most every weekend".
He knew the ur-design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in his transfer to Vienna and his reuse of generosity and ease.
At the moment, there were much more problems in the reconstruction: the building was "an energy shield", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fibre were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel bearings have been reinforced or replaced, and covered with asbestos roofs have been repaired.
Two underheads gave room for the new use, a reduced light grave between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge leads to entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is carved in the old red-brown rust protection color.
And the movie room is even as much as it used to be.
And all of this under the strict supervision of the memorial authority and with a small state.
"Sometimes a material had to be found, which is good and cheap, and it also liked the Memorial Protection Office," Krischanitz says, pointing to a rumbling floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstructions, the building remains flexible and easy.
It was difficult to be with the Pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "get a proper consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it is a city-building accident: around the Swiss garden is the newly planned "main railway quarter", with office and residential houses.
And another accident may still occur: the 21st house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporal Art Hall, and as you can hear it, it is already negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway planted winter crisis package in millions height
The train has developed a crisis plan to prevent traffic accidents in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter accidents and delays, the Deutsche Bahn also publishes a newspaper report of over 70 million euros this year.
The "Picture" section reported earlier on a group internal crisis plan, investments of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This should also improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, there is a duplication of internal and external staff for snow-swimming on rail stations and railways to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free up railways up to the start of operation and 90 per cent of the necessary operating gears within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Head of Railway Rüdiger Grube had warned after a summit meeting with government and industry before train accidents and delays this winter.
In the past winter, the train had major problems in passenger traffic, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Railway Agency for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been creating for years that it has to have ICE train axles tested significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne main station had an axle fracture.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the United States
After the riot about Chief Josef Ackermann, a new accident comes from the United States: the Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry crisis still holds its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in a comparison to deal with disputes due to the plea of five major partner banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a whole series of large banks to have led the partner banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have put the risks below.
During the financial crisis, such securities have lost a strong value and the banks are sinking into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank cleared no debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which was committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Social Banks and is in the process of jumping in to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA seeks to replace the billions of serious damage caused.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator also had other large banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, who complained about the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The Mortgage-backed securities in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
Based on this house credit.
When the U.S. Immobilienblase was placed in 2007, this became a number of financial firms to be suspended.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank killed Lehman Brothers.
Even if the events have been back for a few years, the banks are now facing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have urged countless complaints to recover or resolve irregularities.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest appeal wave.
It proposes 18 international large banks to have transferred the two state-owned U.S. Real Estate Finance Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to mortgage business in the amount of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint from the FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that Frankfurters meet for "substantial losses" without, however, calling an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank has rejected the claims as persistent and declared its intention to refuse.
Warren Buffet rises with 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffet invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of companies only makes bad forecasts.
Now, however, he has read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He already had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily providing services and providing computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as a knight's strike in the financial world.
As a result, the IT-Hurgstein can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed in the US economics agent CNBC that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway is thus one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffet said that IBM hasn't even known anything about the engagement yet.
He praised the management that he himself had taken care of in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," said Buffett about the strategy.
For a long time, IBM has been focusing on the elucidative IT services such as the operation of computer centres.
The over 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffet had been sold by technology firms to date.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffet was caught by a freight train, by a lubricant manufacturer or by machinery farmers.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a whole series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded them with clever investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After the Buffet investment was announced, the share of the IBM increased primarily by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars in the stock exchange and is thus among the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, as buff fat said, he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the Zwickauer Celle, Turkish media in the German rule of law doubt.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which now lives again.
The murder of eight Turkish and a Greek retailer in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is heard in Turkey and within the German population in Germany with fear and concern.
Because for many German Turks, this restores a long-standing belief: since the fire strikes in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
However, the fact that there is a foreign hostility in Germany has never been questioned.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet visible for a long time.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" called the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection and shows that German authorities could also have been involved in the legal radical fungus.
In addition, the Turkish municipality of Germany reacted: at the weekend, she recalled with a mob in front of the Brandenburg gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians at a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Procurement Agreement.
In happy colours, the meeting was staged - as a story of success.
As an earmark, the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's Gift to the Fifteenth" is the heading of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" is also not allowed to draw this mental connection.
"It begins to smell," says the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people were murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The conduct of the police and their subsequent arrests are highly critical in German internet forums.
Why the German authorities have not been more inclined to look for suspects in the right-wing extremist circles, the authors are surprised.
Some of them at least show a rhetorical readiness to drastic means: "If the migrants continue to smear here, there is nothing else but self-defence and weaponry."
"That'll probably be the best self-protection."
"From the good of the enlightenment and suitability of the punishment of the entire network, the internal peace in Germany is very much dependent on," writes "Selelen".
What it means when domestic peace is at risk in Germany, the attacks of Mölln and Sollingen in the 1990s explained.
The photo of Solingen's firehouse is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed to the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can occur in right-wing violence.
However, the attacks intensified the Wer-S feeling on Turkish side.
Do not repeat the past error
In the Turkish press at that time, the failure of German politics to comply with the attacks was particularly condemned: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the firefighting of Solingen, he sent a telegram to the Turkish presidents, but he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Trauerfaire in Cologne - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many fees the Turkish people paid.
Just as the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many Germans has been in the rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and re-evaluate the right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time open words are needed.
The scandal base of Zurich
The most adventurous bank of Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
In the financial crisis, the UBS has been almost bankrupt and has since fallen from one crisis to the next.
Now it's about to fix a German.
That's certainly not how Axel Weber thought.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, he was announced that in 2013 he would begin a almost equally spectacular new job: the CEO of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucid career step.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its renewed solidarity and made friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has won the tournament."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be different.
A retailer of UBS in London had gone through all of the bank's security systems and decommissioned some 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's famous banker, had to go.
The President-in-Office of the UBS has since also been called upon - and all the questions: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
Weber was already known to be able to consult the Bank in February 2012.
And the President-in-Office of the Governing Council will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be tough.
He is not a banker, rather an economist and a notary banker and would certainly have had a time of employment.
He then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it deserves the title "the largest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
Because the UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently she was the world's largest asset manager - and has been making a scandal in the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, the once so proud Swiss bank is saved.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the supple and solid but also exploited Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
This was how UBS managed 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 billion more cash-providing customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she was put as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The single banker and later a long-term bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says, "My students were always the subject of the UBS as a pattern of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, how could I just be wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, for the first time, it was revealed that something belonged in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, chief Peter Wuffli returned surprisingly, who was still a high-tech and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, they realized why he had gone.
The bank's investment had fallen short of subprime papers and had to write billions off.
In order to shoulder this, the UBS announced an increase in capital in terms of saying and writing 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, however, who would have been on the nose of some until recently: an intransparable Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so silent that it was not even known for its name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, and the second-best-paid Swiss Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, returned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was faced with a financial crisis in view of its failure to invest in the financial crisis and had to be rescued from the state.
The National Bank bought out UBS for ten billion problematic securities, the Swiss property company gave six billion francs for a forced change loan that they could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was scared - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it accommodates such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet amount of the 2007 UBS was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see Graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says Bankenforschiger.
The second one joined the first disaster.
A few months later, the UBS capitalized in the tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to disclose the data of potential customers who might have withdrawn with the help of the bank's taxes.
She also agreed to pay $780 million - as a repayment of unjust profit from these transactions and a fine.
In order to make the UBS more or less open, the UBS had helped in the tax tuition.
At the same time, she lost something that had been their capital since the beginning of her life in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of misery.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within less months, the Bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: in the investment banking by the lack of speculation and in the asset management by means of tax deduction.
And just as it became a little quieter again, just as it was thought, now the UBS will get it back, then this countless dealer story follows: A single dealer swallows 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going on.
And it's obvious: with risk management in the investment banking, it's obviously still not working.
"In the case of Adobe, it has to be found that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial board of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have the risk control."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long been involved, to become patrons of the world's great wealth: not too big a risk for security for money - it also allowed the world to collapse elsewhere in the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks have become a symbol of unscrupulous reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of the famous Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at the Zurich Railway Station, which leads directly from the main station to the Zurich Sea, which is surrounded by the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are elegant, the tenants are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's is found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Confuciary Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have lived here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of the UBS is accessed by a difficult turning door.
The walls of marble are decorated with marble, before thick leather sessels, next to the bank logo, are a large sign of the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes forced - or betrayed - how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds himself.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, he finally does, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks.
The UBS has become too large, it finds - especially in the investment banking, where the Angelaxes have also spread.
The Swiss wouldn't have said anything else.
"And if so, they've adapted to the seats of the fish-fishers for a long time."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking, which changed the UBS, that protected its first high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros were authorized by politicians to rescue the bank that was facing the bankruptcy.
How could it happen?
If you talk to Swiss banks, they see the problem above all in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large banks of Switzerland joined a violent group.
There was a bank that was already too big for the small Swiss - and still grew.
The two different precursor banks of the UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on assets management in Zurich and a poorer but more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks paid a lot of money to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, Group leader of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Opel were a dream team," says Bankenforscher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the Hochintellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Opel, the buchman who has worked from the banking teaching up to the top."
But Opel left behind for the conclusion on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger says.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: courage came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the leadership meetings on which the Wuffli Group Chief of Staff issued the same word again and again: Goldman Sachs fell from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She introduced the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some of the steps you've taken have already been successful.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she played with them all the way up.
However, business consultants, who were commissioned, highlighted a weakness: In the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in US mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that it almost cost the existence.
Hunger after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in American subprime facilities.
She developed into a huge machine that packed up securities on American mortgage loans and went on to keep itself at risk.
Even if other banks were looking for the exit for the longest time.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank experts Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after the other when the attempts to clean up seemed harder than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become a locker seat and are still alert.
Whoever runs the Grand Bank now has a nearly impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has come up with all the accompanying business models.
Bankenforschiger already has an idea: End with the investment banking, concentration on property management, return to the Swiss roots.
That's how far the bank doesn't want to go.
But the investment bank is supposed to be falling hard, so much is already clear.
On the next Thursday, the new Bank Chief Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Switzerland was thought to be only a transitional solution when the bank suddenly separated from predecessors Grübel.
In the meantime, he went through: he was to conduct the business of the UBS on a permanent basis, the Zürich Bank shared on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank in the middle of the 1990s.
3500 seats he runs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
Why does she want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask now.
In public, he only says he'll be looking for an apartment in Zurich with his wife for the first time.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe loaded US stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has taken courage from US investors for the weekend.
The government change in Athens and Rome remained powerless.
The drenched industrial production on the continent gave rise to hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the Keim.
The general relief of government change in Rome and Athens could not be implemented.
The euro fell over the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still full in the past week, not half empty - but now the problems were pushed back in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were found on the sales lists.

In September, the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as the Eurostat Statistics Office reported.
The US investors said skeptically: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will soon not be able to escape a recession, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment-led Warren Buffett confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early to invest in European bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade old principle over the hood and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the traditional group's stock exchange and allowed him to record at first almost a percent higher against the trend in trade.

Smart rabbits spread in cities
In many places seeds are considered "problem birds": however, from the cities, the highly intelligent animals can no longer spread, said experts.
Those who like them, the others want to get rid of them very quickly: cows have been part of the city’s image for centuries, but in many municipalities there are complaints about the garbage and noise of animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Grains are no longer extracted from the cities, experts said at the first cryysymposium in the East Frisian desert.
There, experts from all over the federal territory spoke about possible ways.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Naturalists also led the problems in cities to flee to the land of the specially protected seeds: chemical use in agriculture has increasingly destroyed the traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing construction and the cases of typical bristle trees made life difficult for the birds.
Herbs are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 pairs of bridesmaids are located in the western coast, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in the desert.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the massive killing of rabbits in the country circle for negative impact lines had been provided.
Critics had referred to the capture of the animals in bird traps and the defeat of knots as particularly brutal.
"The normal distribution, the fertilization, brings nothing," the city planner and landscape planner Werner Klöver has found out of empty.
Throw away blisters with water or fall trees, have often undesirable effects, also said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals fluctuate, large colonies break up and spread to other places."
Degradation should be considered only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding country, the problem is not solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said.
Think of a combination of pets from sensitive residential areas and locker offerings to re-occupied them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, "instead of chain saws", suggested for a completely different treatment with the animals: "We can finally draw a pick in the face of the best self-consciousness."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had founded the Ascheberger Krägen-Lehrppad, which informed the sign of the life of the highly intelligent seedlings.
The project will already be adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the birds' noise: "There is every amount of communication that has much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seeds not only use tools to get to a delicious bite, but as a tool even present their own.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University have recently tested four seeds, how far the intelligence of the birds is enough.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to bring a storm to enter to reach a motten larvae.
Without much training, they realized the target size and shape of a stone to allow the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the pfifig rabbits then had to solve a more fragile problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small ember with a motten larvae.
With the accelerator, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them wires.
All four animals formed a hook, with which they then thrust the ember at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four saws even achieved this.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks remained on a coup.
The favorites of Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland are at EM 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the latest tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Playoffs.
Guided by the two successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53.) Portugal struck Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation perfect after the 0:0 out of the example.
In the play-off back game, the Czechs run a 1:0 (0:0) on the outside side of Montenegro after the example (2:0) was a clear thing.
No more burning Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) achieved the next hit for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvězdan Misimovic with a transformed trade mark (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened for Bosnia twice.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Red Card (54.).
Bosnia has already been defeated in the 2010 WM Playoffs in South Africa in Portugal.
In the Lisbon Stadium da Luz, Portugal was given a start to measure.
Ronaldo hunted a free pass from about 30 meters to the early lead into the masks.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed his wide range of qualities and reached from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger of the English Tablet Leader Manchester City placed a headball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball does not exceed the torline (33).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
After that, Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding stood at the center.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Strafraum, Stark decided on a wave and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial treatment meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which certainly transformed Misimovic.
However, after the break, the European Vice-Chairman of 2004 made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Peter Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81th minute.
This leads the European Master from 1976 to the fifth time to the EM.
However, the team of Coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nuremberg) also had luck and had to pass a second in the beginning.
In the last moment, Mr Petr Chech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when Duo Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot only near the door of Chech in the 40th minute of turning from the fine line.
After the break, the quern had to save for the already hit world class quarter of the Czechs, again the FC Seoul storm had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not leave a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to place his seat as well as certainly on the WM-third Bank of 2002, the Croatians are allowed to rejoice over their fourth participation in an EM-end.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks had almost started a dream.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the posh, attacker Kazim Kazim could not also sink the dancer in the door.
After a second of horror, however, Croatia took control more and more.
After the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made the place for the village founder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionnaire Daniel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Entracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni leads to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken care of the 4th success in the 32nd minute of leadership.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) just for the guests.
From the beginning, Ireland had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian team prevent the possible leadership.
But in the 32nd minute it was that much.
After a disillusioned defense by Schlussmann Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball to 1:0 above the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests in the next billions of years in China and wants to double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were to flow, the Dax group shared on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up appropriate staff," Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The staff is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of landfills of the world market leader for corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beautifulness and Fear. A story of the First World War, told in nineteen fates" begins with a long list of major people who go to heart.
Here is a tip how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will know these people very well in English romantic story, and these main persons will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments in which you, like English men and women, are lost in the fog of war and robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he did not necessarily describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are few ambassadors, quick reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, rather "a book about what it was like". It is about " feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less incapacitated men and women on both sides of the war together, from school girls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, car drivers and office staff.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, get crazy or die.
Each of these lives fades like the vocal churches in one church, some to come, while others to be destroyed.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the defeating war on the Westfront.
"Beautifulness and horror" walks with expert insight over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall into bee body, a celebration of Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsets fly is an unresolved problem.
This is almost from the beginning of a moving book.
The war overflows the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, who smells at the cordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with her children, and cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or get the escape?
Who's coming at all?
No one understands what happens or why this war is being fought at all.
"Frequent facts", according to Englund, "were furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, alpine dreams and rumors."
"Beauty and Fear" is followed by individuals such as Florence Farmrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories have been taken mainly by memories, letters and other material that has already been published.
Their life stories may be frightening or exciting, but they are extremely vivid in the light of the collection of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them act with lack and self-help.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere."
"Resistance coffee, false aluminium, false radar rubber, paper compounds, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacements in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in hammeal fat (and lastly served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potatoes, shoes filled with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food supplements allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own passion for the wilderness and says about the war: "I feel that in spite of all this, it is what was more intended for men to sit in the chair than to sit in the canvas, with the evening sheet or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and so to do, as it meant such a facade of civilization and as to have no barbarium behind his own reinforced and beaten shirt chest."
On the contrary, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and nobody takes notice of it or takes care of it.
"If you think of self-sacrifice, you want to think that this is happening in front of a public," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new forms of terrorism.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic conflict," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beastarium of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in the suit that beats while he sits behind a desk."
People behave in an unexpected way and there are also liberal behaviors like heroism.
Englend answers the soldiers who actively tried to get in touch with a prostitute with a sex disorder in order to escape from the frontal service.
"The grand expression of this can be discovered in trade with Gonocokken-Eiers, because soldiers bought and flocked to their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate shouted in his eyes, which led them to be blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englund's poetry is embellished and yet unsurpassed and fits perfectly with his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way in which the war "once upon a time uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders bring them to battle.
The best books about the First World War were mostly falsified like Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" as extensive historical books.
The band of Englund is part of an unconventional space hall.
His book has the most glorious ending I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it any more.
But it's as if he had taken us off this side with his book with the main people before the nose and burned us with a string of wood.
After an early failure, a minutely planned overlap
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
One had decided for the night of Monday on Tuesday because at this time there are hardly people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All the others believed at first to participate in one exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was facing full challenges.
The events of the last few weeks, such as the use of pepperspray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the desert and gives homeowners a huge increase in public sympathies, could not be repeated.
And so the police operation was carried out to remove the protestors from the Zucconti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared it by observing how occupations were conducted in other cities.
A disaster had taken place with a view to Zucotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to enter the park came "in the last minute", someone who was familiar with the commands said what was said for a declaration as "practice".
"The few police officers involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was around the Zucconti Park were the top officials of the resort."
One reason for keeping secrets was a lesson that had taught the city.
On 14 October, officials wanted to clear the park, but then week back when hundreds of Protestants came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including deployment commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are normally used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people in the park enter and leave, almost like a pendler, so that 1 hour at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people in the park is standing," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were ready to leave at the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages that were ringing from the speakers seemed to frighten many Protestants.
When the public officials entered the park in their bright blue windshields, many Protestants simply got their stuff together and left the place.
The police said that up to 1:45 p.m., no tents would be taken to give the protestors time to pack their possessions and goods together.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering in the area to intervene, and arrests in the park should be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson for the President of the police, said this was done to their own safety.
But many journalists claimed that they wanted to stop them from observing police operations in the park, and they said that the officers' behaviour was very rude.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars in the Church Street could have taken pictures on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the big through each other on personal matters of the Protestants, including suitcases, handcuffs and cloths with clothes, they followed their city cleaning employees who had stopped what had been left behind.
Some Protestants who refused to go were dragged outside. Images of this appeared shortly later on the Internet.
A main core of Protestants was near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some established barriers and police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp joined their arms.
And two people were chained to trees themselves, said Mr. Kelly.
Disaster protection officers have been called to cut them loose.
As Mr. Kelly said, up to 3:30 p.m., there were no arrests in the park.
The room was closed after the police said 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, due to "immortal arrest and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent on-site official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the crime department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In the case that they should access, a second group of officials was waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortland Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was possible to observe how these police stations continued to expand the area around the Zucotti Park.
In one place, people were watched as several officers, many of them with shield shields, drove out.
About 28 people were in the northern district.
Some of the most violent activities of the night took place in the south of the park.
By 5 o'clock, a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of wood.
In the end, an officer and a Protestant came to the hospital.
Officer's union will file a complaint against the city for dismissals
The trade union, the hundreds of school staff who lost their jobs last month, is planning to call on the city on Wednesday, as the discounts due to their undue influence on the schools that poor students teach are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last possibility that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to withdraw the dismissals.
Six hundred and twenty-seven school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the worst employees in the city and who lost their jobs in a chess race on 7 October described the trade union leader as a political hack for refusing access to a health fund held by the working groups last year, with which the budget cuts should be closed.
This claim was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a meeting of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of Schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that had been adopted in June.
A member of the City Council went back and told him that there was nothing more specific in the budget than that the school assistance staff would be released.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference to announce the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will be presented by Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as defendants, and eight dismissed workers as contenders, all of them colouring or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice of the City, said that the city did not present the complaint and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of school leavers in the city’s poor districts to support a complaint for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more help since they were chronically underfunded.
It indicates that while there were no leavers on Staten Island and only a few leavers in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 assistants were released in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight school assistants, who were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of important parents who can organize donations to receive budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut this year by 3.26 percent. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for extra financing for each school registration.
The union also complains that the leaders of the High Schools were led through the language in a memo in Ireland, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" (German: translate) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's cost list to a pool of available workers paid by the centre.
"Six hundred and sixty support coordinators were released, not translated," said the draft complaint.
Mission over, Congress ready to agree with Libya
Finally, it seems as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already aware of the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-term dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American integration.
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations of the Senate adopts a resolution that supports the President John Kerry (Massachsets) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), commending Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for its "mouth".
"This resolution respects the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was simple in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House dispute the choice of a number of resolutions for the approval or misconception of the role of the US military in the NATO Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide range of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate. Furthermore, the Chamber passed a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission runs into a kind of legislative fire - with a congress that had enough to criticise Obama's conduct in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to finally take the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell in August among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their own liberation" and "honors the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Committee on Foreign Relations or will they break the legislators, as the June Act did?
The last sentence is against the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top member of the Committee.
Lugars spoke on Monday said he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget to be a top priority in almost every parliamentary term of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of Republican Bob Goodlate (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or in another area currently coming to the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlate's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled by this Congress and include a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to both the Congress and the Senate - other differences only slightly apart.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contracting parties - especially the beginners of the Republicans who want to polish their course of life - the possibility of saying that they have "written" such a measure.
The Financial Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires both the Senate and the Congress to vote on a change in the budgetary compensation.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that the members of the Congress may submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the limitation at two times the President's office.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits a heresy among homosexuals is also a change that prevents the burning of flags from being repeated.
Some legislators would also like to allow the abolition of federal legislation if the two-thirds of the States reject it.
As eager as the members have proposed amendments, they are moving as quickly as they have in recent years.
At the 111th Congress, legislator 77 introduced such changes. at the 110th Congress 66.
In comparison with those in the early 1990s in which members regularly propose more than 150 amendments every two years, the figures provided by the Senate library are lost.
But they were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was already proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Founded but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shot at her during an election in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) came up on Monday night on national television. She alone sang the Broadway song "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the one returning to the congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC messages "20/20", she called for words and needed help as she left.
The transmission showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the ball, which divided its shoulder, drilled the left side of its brain and pushed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to the convention to give her triumphal voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the assassination in January, when six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her healing as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41): "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope."
The special follows Gifford's recovery since the assassination of January 8.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with a coldly shaved head and a long bowl over the chair.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while the therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nickel with the head.
A sugar with lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You see the congressional delegates singing together with the therapists at Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Whena Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that on 12 March, he had read an article of a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time for the six people who were killed during the assassination.
The moderate protector Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is forced to treat medically while waiting for his negotiation.
"Many people died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you haven't been defeated?" said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you will endure and you will recover, and you will return stronger than ever before.
Corpses feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots, and Marines gathered around him.
The amount in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the Gala, who was observed by the chief of staff and then president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was compassion.
The striking conflicting impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes amazing American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, servants say.
The public is becoming increasingly concerned with how they treat people in uniform suffering.
"We were no victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who will be authorized in Iraq and soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support him is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear unrecognizable or in dispute with the public they serve.
They have also recognized that the anger of the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam war was far worse.
As a result, discussions on compassion take place between war veterans in silence and in private.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned her that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a feeling of reverence, as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "fighting, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken up a elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the respondents were subtly asking whether he could stand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of light of the military is partly due to the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services in the battlefield are seen by a country that has little experience with the military and only has little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only rarely taken out as praise.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as usual in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., the US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military is the growing pressure to get through rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged for non-interference in a case of rape before the military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Mountain free Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her casino in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who brought a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if he could accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texanner had removed her concerns.
I thought, "But what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my stomach."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claimed her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers are looking forward to a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which they will decide whether a complaint they have brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take place against widespread violence within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed a complaint involving 17 plaintiffs, but who rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claimed that they had been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers and that the military failed to detect, condemn, or provide an appropriate legal remedy after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individual people who are in the position to eradicate the cultural revenge of the leadership?"
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs saying that they put their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many further complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject a complaint.
The documents of the Court of Justice, which are available on the newsweek, provide details of the defence strategy, first of all, that the military cannot be accused of being injured by current or former soldiers to whom it has come into the forces.
Under a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for any injury to soldiers who are included in the active service.
"The material damage was caused during the military service of the plaintiffs," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence rejects any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the struggle, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with indigenous women in the war zones.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time the military is modernized, says Burke.
And she is not standing by herself in her battle. Three more complaints are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four main military academys due to the need to promote a hostile atmosphere.
Regardless of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder", the victims of rape in order to get them out of the service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (dt.: Administration of War Veterans), in which she proposed discriminatory practices in her dealings with performance claims for persons who reported having been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were submitted independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offered a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report, published in March, also investigates the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases in the military came before the court, only half as many as in civil law.
The contenders in Burkes case describe their attacks as only the first series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the arbitrary rape of the military police less than an hour after the incident.
On that night, as she says, she was asked to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a set of rapes and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut in his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing she was asked about the sex she had before the assault with her friend.
Six persons said in the name of the necessary actor, who was finally released.
"I remember well the day the sentence was read," Lyman says.
"I thought the waves would be used. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure, that was my procedure.'
Lyman was asked to seek out a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and explained it to the disabled.
In January 2010, she was unfairly released, so she did not receive any support.
Whether the complaints submitted by Lyman and the other plaintiffs come forward is purely speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he points out, "In my view, they should come forward."
What lies between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I am, in time, a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military goes back a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same fear that brings a liability.
He adds, "The chances are against them... but it's important to them that they try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her way, Burke, the plaintiff of the plaintiffs, will begin with its hundreds of other complaints for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reform comes," she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who stood by to have begun a massacre in Norway in July, when 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: He has spent a lot of time before his computer attack and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only need to log on to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recently published report by the British Idea Factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply have to use the website's advertising tool to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as it has been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing groups across Europe and then visited them with Adds, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users refer to an survey in which they were asked for their educational status, their attitude towards violence and their assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office only once.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online leaders of right-wing groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas manufacturers, medical researchers and political scientists use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding on average three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page by almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people who are not normally reached on the street with their clipboard.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook all this goes away - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A current study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full life on Facebook tend significantly more to problem drinking than students who hesitated about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, such as resident advisors, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-author and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify dangerous children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly taps the data of its own population.
The data team of the site has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the 2010 interim elections and a National Happiness Index (which used first-line data that only has Facebook access - Masters of digital freedom have known for a long time that the site should make its large database available for other research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want it now or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to print your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
So, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social - and every amount of social life still takes place offline."
"Caltic and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood for two rounds, where 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Norwegian Temple Knight," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations to support Hasideologies and because this is why multiculturalism is supported."
"I recognize the laws, but I'm not guilty."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he denied Breivik, who gave a prefaced speech, the permission to turn to his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the Breivik police keep in investigation for 12 further weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will control all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he was behind the castle and row.
All took part in the goal of getting everything out of a lockdown.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," told a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me, it goes a bit further after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally throughout the entire hearing. He looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre remark that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had complications.
It may seem to some that the attacks of July 22 were the work of an individual extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the anxiety and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 Lessons of the interview with the dead Steve Job, shown this week in a theater
After Steve's death on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford, and the technique was developed as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans find, however, is perhaps the most recently discovered job interview that has been cleared this week before special film shows on the important markets, how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and himself named hippie, but he was also an acrobic organizer who was eager to build charts - a man who believed that many managers were suffering from "a disease of the mind", "that a really great idea 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Facchidiotes" about the break-up of the computer. He sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, ten years had passed since jobs from Apple were forced, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and he was looking forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in Facchidiotes, he says that the copies of the interview were missing in delivery.
Only after Job's death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This easy-to-read film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes this Wednesday and Thursday into the Landmark Theatre.
For someone who is known to reject detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which the job clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism comes to an end, when he seems impatient to respond to the questions of Crinely and push him to go faster on issues or on the sidelines of greater importance.
Prior to the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview appears in some way incredibly wide-ranging when jobs evaluates what other companies do in their opinion right or wrong and their own vision for the future of the computer.
It is a thing to read posthumous values of career jobs. But seeing jobs here as the desired dreamer, who is on the jump to greatness, is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things might be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all of this, he left and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
As he learned to lead a company:
"During all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found.
Jobs continues his efforts to rationalize accounting with Apple.
Surprisingly how the costs were recorded - most of them started with "standard costs", which were only assumed and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was blinded:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could connect to the telephone company and communicate remotely.
Much has been written about the device, but Job's enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorisation is stick-in.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another one while they browse as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things a half a dozen times around the globe and when we cried on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," he says.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think it would be without Apple.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious string, the Wozniak and he almost withdrew when they called in the middle of the night through the blue box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they could imitate Henry Kissinger so well.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, both had to smile before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unprepared Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and calling him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs were given a part-time job for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tubes, and I fell in love with him.
At HP, I would climb up as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
More than once in the interview, jobs talk about how to invent new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about both the construction and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the problems he had when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... they screamed at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15.
About large companies that leave:
Long before he let Apple live again, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants were driving with their visions in Stolpern and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're making a better copyr or printer, na and?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are such people] who ultimately lead companies and the product with which people are forced out of the decision-making process.
The product genre, which has led to this monopolar position, is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - handicraft.
It happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times larger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You've won the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is every amount of handicraft between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his faults.
You have to vote, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to notice 5,000 things, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Finally, it runs out on the taste, it runs out on the fact that you try to get together with the best of the stuff that man has created, put together and then try to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists claw.
We're always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh made great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were the best computer scientists in the world by chance.
If it weren't for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinate with opponents of health laws, accepted as court case
On the day that the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the political issue of whether to hear an attack on the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the office that the case will be brought before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the requests for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint raised by 26 states against the extensive reform of the health system, which was decided by the Congress last year, a law that became the target of conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic debate is expected in March, which is likely to stifle their outcome in the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time when the judgment is announced.
The lawyer standing before the court and claiming that the law is to be dropped will probably be Paul Clement, once a state attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative principles of law.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical agent Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted the case, in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Group leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting Féderalist Society events for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were, they would fall under principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge may participate in benefit events by law and other organizations, while the judge may not be a speaker, respector or according to a program no guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the associated offices as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in alarming moral and regulatory activists is sufficient.
"This surprising break with morals and the contrary to the code is punishing the complaints of some judge lies, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil right movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with swimming proceedings in the court."
Their actions and their support for a donation action for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would be too easily involved with groups who are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claimed that it was Judge Elena Kagan who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general lawyer under Obama's government when the first legal attacks first came before the court.
Her critics forced Kagan to withdraw himself from hearing the case because of entrepreneurship, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unaccompanied.
Kagan doesn't make arrangements to do this.
Boeing draws record orders from 18 billion dollars to land
Emirate airline orders 50 double aircraft of type Boeing 777 with one option on 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It is really rare news that a company receives a order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal when the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircraft is total at a record sum of $18 billion.
Also unusual is Boeing's customer: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, Chicago’s company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced at the weekend its greatest order of all times for commercial aircraft, measured at the value of the order: 50 double Boeing 777 jets.
The warrant came from the air carrier Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced Boeing at the Dubai Air Show in 2011, an option for the purchase of 20 additional aircraft, which will increase the total price of the list to 26 billion dollars.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called dreamliner, which greatly improved the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is worth more than $1 billion.
"That's absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Börsenfachmann von Morningstar.
"The quality of this special customer is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they do not only have the money to pay the aircraft. Instead, an increase in oil prices, which usually damages airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or move aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural assurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitors SAS in check that attacks the position of A350.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced, one would move the introduction of the largest A350 that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was shifted to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher cost and scope.
Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister seems to lose election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported Fausto Vallejo from the PR in the race around the governor's posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent elections. She claimed on Monday that the drug dealer had influenced the race for one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for government positions in the Western state from the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire election process and especially on the day in question is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... you have occupied election cabins, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo seems to have only barely hit Claderon who had led the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative Party Action National PAN of her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently acting governor, came to place three, a difficult defeat for the split and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, lies in connection with drug dealers and forces the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been dominated for a long time by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates were out of town for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how reprehensible the elections in Michoacan also appear.
The man who is probably represented by the PR in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington, saying, "I think this victory will allow us to look forward to next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the Eurozone in its difficult debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB, based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations of the world have to do "all in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that the "no leadership" would look at the difficulties in Europe and said that financial support from European leadership and European resources through Asia would help prevent the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all sitting on the same boat."
"So everyone is helpful who can help Europe out of this crisis," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then with all the means."
The European monetary union has been in a difficult debt crisis in recent months.
In the past few days, Italy's interest rates have increased dangerously, and the Prime Ministers have fallen both from Italy and Greece.
The emerging heavy debt crisis in Europe is afraid that the global economy could collapse into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging countries would have to unite to support the euro area.
Mr Nag said that any support from Asia is channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of the EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - provide greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power", to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the withdrawal of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face great challenges and we have to get a high level of growth."
"There is no option, it is an assignment, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have the capacity to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor at the American Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India to help Europe, of which more than 800 million are living on 2 dollars or less per day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks go 50 to rent and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why Indian reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, leading with jobs in bad shape, loss-making institutions such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" on all Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for 2011/ now threatens "the risk of graduation" due to the threatening danger from Europe.
He said harmful threshold markets had to create "crisis plans" in order to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their verbs.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible defence cuts
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta urged the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, thus triggering a financial chain reaction from the pentagon halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts in the amount of 450 billion dollars over the next decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of 600 billion dollars or more will be necessary if the Congress cannot complete the expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating to the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement, leading to a so-called appeal, would result in 23% general cuts as well as a stopover of many new projects.
"Even if a high cut, carried out in such an unimaginable way, most of our ship and construction projects would make it impossible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and other modernization efforts seriously harm," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also have been forced to separate ourselves illegally from most of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow civilians to reach the target with certainty of limited probability."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alarm service."
The cuts were finally met with the fighting troops," Panetta said.
"While wartime quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the attack, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," warned Panetta.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the attitudes and attitudes that support the war."
"The staff's salaries would be cut short, which would result in late payments to war dealer and the legal as well as political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and requested further details of the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of an attack by the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are strongly opposed to this draconic action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panettas' letter.
"This is a result that we can't live with, and it's certainly not that we should be forced to."
"The attack is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the senator's new warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to remove the Pentagon from the cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly unmistakably expressed the possible cuts, although he had many years of experience with the budget at the Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a dark image that might appear - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without mattresses."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an Air Force Squad without enough trained pilots."
"It's a papermaker, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It is a power of conflict that lacks morals and alertness and that is not able to take it with potential opponents."
"She lets it get really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details of how reductions "make significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our global employability and intervention, leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of the strike could fall to the victim, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the army and the Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to $80 billion in the next 10 years, but the proponents say it is an important next step to repair, so that possible dangers can be linked by China and other opponents.
How to Avoid a Lie
A look at the current strike lines shows how thoughtful and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The presidential candidate for the Republicans, Herman Cain, is concerned with the charge of becoming Lord of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides face each other's lies.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of the Meineid, as reportedly reportedly, after which a retired football coach boy was sexually abused.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and destroy countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a fool when he turned on slanders, which were quickly rejected by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violating the campaign funding, which is related to the misappropriation of an external affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that triggered President Bill Clinton when he lied at the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky during his second term of office.
Stories about swings in school and in college exams are widely distributed.
There were occasions when teachers gave their students the test answers so that they could do well in their performance reviews themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and swings are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Like studies, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be nightmares.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or "to discover lies" is one that is important for everyone, and this is for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a society game such as Scaraden, where the goal is to call "Have You!", the development of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades at respected universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths were removed from the lie.
Lies look into one's eyes.
They don't always jump, puke, puke, and puke.
However, you must not conclude that these liars are difficult to discover and escape.
A trained liar can pass on to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim that fine facial expressions, question and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing field of desertification, and it is clear that the desirability of deception is a modern ability to learn easily and helps us in the truth in our complex world, especially when the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people to awaken their interest and control their own emotions, and they feel intuitive how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, the extroverted people lie more often than the introverted people that men lie more often "self-orientated" than women whose lies are more "orientated to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been expelled as an offender, others feel less guilty of having angels in that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
It's called Baseling, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the smile, the quality of the voice of your test person.
You should know better when someone usually triples with the foot, so they don't blame him for injustice when he triples during a meeting with the foot.
Then take into account the additions of reprehensible verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Consider these additions as alarm bells that scream, not as proof of a detachment.
People who lie may be shocked when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet show towards the door or they refuse to go out, change their position in a significant way or show a "relax after the setting conversation", this deep, relaxing breaths and the change in attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questions often indicate false that an attitude conversation is over just to keep an eye on after this relaxation after the attitude conversation.
Also, pay attention to the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's exodus is famous when he used the past form, when he claimed his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or if one repeats a silly question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a clever question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to the best of knowledge and conscience."
As a result, the answer will be seen rather than true, often the alarm bells shriveled.
There is no magic to get rid of lies, but one can learn skills, thanks to which it is possible to get rid of them.
Thanks to these abilities, anyone who is rarely a victim of fraud can become a victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised by late US approval
A few days after Obama's government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, in which the trade unions were exacerbated and at the same time relaxed, the pipeline-building company is trying to redesign the project so that it can return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills will be routed to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Parbax from TransCanada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline would be finally approved, even with a different course.
This was followed by a announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision was made regarding a federal permit for the project, until the new possible course was checked, which would cover the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala acquis, a large sub-water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may result in a decision by 2013, after the elections in the coming year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline had to go through six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
However, the legislator Nebraskas, who opposes the plan, weighs the laws to force a return from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and water.
The current study on the influence on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had only little influence on the environment, but the source of the energy economy said that the head reviewer of the Ministry had requested a separate probe of the review process, which focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was set up by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, was in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle complained that she allegedly forced a child out of fear of breaking up
A New Yorker family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had an assault attack, which would have caused her little daughter so afraid that she had surrendered to fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer, 18 months old Genevieve Monk, was so afraid that she suffered "change of personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was last November 10th when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Rosaanna, a child gardener, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Rosaanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on the arm into the lobby in her building at the Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and left her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back to the arm," she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't delay your daughter near the door," said Rosanane Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to joke - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to pour water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle stumbled upon the mother who still carried Genevieve on her arm, and had to be stopped from accompanying her and moved to a waiting car," said Rosanade Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later the LaBelle family asked in writing for an apology, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is based on a non-injurious statement, but the family attorney Sam Davis said that he does not count an honor and plans the family, the money they get, the child cancer aid will be paid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when a child gardener is placed over the day that carries an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate change slows the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, unemployment and black labour increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who himself referred to himself as the initiator of the change, and who is in the government with great hopes for economic growth. However, due to climate change, growth cannot be the word, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators worsened.
In February, the low temperatures caused not only losses in millions of farm heights, but also narrowed the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first quarter of the year. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which has been slowing down in other sectors of the economy.
According to a report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development, 582,000 hectares of agricultural-used countries were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity up to November has led to a steady rise in unemployment in the Mexican state. In the first quarter of the year, the Instituto Nacional de Estados y Gegrafía saw a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March 55,053 people in Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53% of the labour force. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28% and from July to 6.19%, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa. These are 1896 people more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, dekan of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autonoma (UAS), commented that the policy of the public institutions is indirect to increasing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the short-term cuts in the legislation adopted to combat money laundering at the Congress, because it is not easy for those who are prohibited to pay dollars to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he explained.
Organisation
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also involves a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and on the other, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look here for work that increases unemployment," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult if you take into account the high share of black labour, which includes, according to INEGI 60.38% of the employees in the country who work without paying into the social insurance funds.
Unemployment and black jobs are the lowest wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (Mexico Institute of Social Insurance) and the Secretariat of Labour y Previsión Social (Government of Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was up to September 5352 pesos, which is much less than the total national average of 7375 pesos.
ADI decrease
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, in 2011, the highest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) over the last ten years is recorded. According to the Secretariat de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted from January to June 630 597 dollars, corresponding to 87.74 percent compared to the $5 143 312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretariat for Development Economics of the Government (Regular Authority for Economic Development) notes a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, which comes mainly from companies from the Tertiary sector.
The debts
In view of the economic crisis, in July, the Government applied for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to revitalize the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities. The Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive impact of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be found by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the company, Mario López Valdé's first year of government became apparent.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the country government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very good this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the lost land this year and we need to make a double effort in 2012. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well-agreed government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he explained.
Long-term economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the famine at the beginning of the year made economic development of the country difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important effects is a slowing economy, which is not moving enough to produce an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will close the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine Call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Mexico, stated in Sinaloa that the state had to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic occupation and line, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will lead the government's efforts in better terms.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, but economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress with the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that the work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg Marihuana
At five years' imprisonment and 100 daily sentences, one of the inhabitants of Navolato was sentenced to eight Kilo Marihuana.
The Public Prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of Marihuana for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN 687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican soldiers during the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez Street against watchpost No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white truck in which he kept a black cloth in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the goods seized were handed over to the judge of the district and the penalty is still in the courthouse.
Debts for construction work
The social constructions provided for in the programs Habitat, Rescue de Espacios Publicos and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the City Authority for Social Development explained that, although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid their existing funds, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was nearly 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far only the Federation and the community had contributed to the construction projects, so it was expected to be delayed.
"12 million must be taxed, and although the year is about to end, they have not given us any money, and that, although they had to pay us a share already in July," he said. "To be too late, we have already begun the construction work, and they have already gone far, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the State had not complied with its obligations, so at the beginning of that time the community had to borrow a loan of 7 million. This corresponds to the amount that the central government should have to bear.
"This has already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not set up to participate in these programmes," he said.
Even if the State authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance has been asked to speed up administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Nearly 12 million must be taxed, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The Court of Justice approves the transition to the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals is one of the most important changes in the world over the last few years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) pointed out the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Palace, which required the conversion of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was the view that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the Bill with details of the switch to the terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute called for by the Senate, as it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order to enable the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the draft complaint drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the bill of law contrary to the Constitution, since the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the radio and television regulation, which would therefore be contrary to the principles of hierarchy and the rule of law.
For the sake of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero agreed.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer appealed to the Legislative Decree and put in place all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Representatives without taking part in the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed no agreement with the project's arguments, meaning that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general rules.
"I also do not believe that if one would do so, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the central government is responsible for constitutional reasons, because it leads to state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it makes better use of the radio spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The removal of the conversion, she felt, was a shift in the use of digitalization, which was a decision in the public interest, which not only has technical views, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, she stressed, "make it necessary to act the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of features which lay the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital conversion, although they had high specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government, with the issue of the bill under appeal, intervenes in the competence of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislation would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the voting lists in Michoacán is considered individually
According to the PreP data, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes in total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of counting the voting lists is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Program de Resultados Electorales Preliminaryes (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the Governors' elections is less than 27 percent, with 879 votes not yet counted in the total of 6074.
In this regard, the President of the Council General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that, just last November, the polling station had adopted a number of rules on harmonizing local regulations with the reforms of the federal states in the field of housing.
It should be borne in mind that Michoacán had not adapted neither his political constitution nor his election law nor his election law to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they did not enter into force during this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided publication in the public prosecutor within the time limits set by the Congress with the argument or objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint submitted by the local legislature and judged the official's vote on constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", since he did not have the right to "decision or vote against it".
Maria de los Ángeles Landeral explained in an interview about the possibility of the individual analysis of the votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Council General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could report the voting list in part or in full.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may not be partially counted The results in the minutes may not be agreed; the minutes on the counting and counting of votes are not in force or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the protocols.
In addition, the total number of filled ballots may be calculated if there is a difference between the required winner and the second-ranking candidate, which is equal to or less than one percentage, at the beginning of the meeting, there is an explicit request from the party or coalition president, the second of which is the said candidates.
The vote count may also be made in its entirety when, after the proper calculation has been completed, it is established that the difference between the required winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage, provided that an explicit application is made by a representative of the party whose second candidate has become the second candidate. In that case, the electoral packages that have been subject to a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second seats is less than 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of the total 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés took place this Sunday at Saltillo, his place of birth. On Monday the death show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila with the others in the accident of life in a plane of the Mexican Air Force. The commander took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon at 12 noon, the officer's ash landed at the Trauerhalle at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza and where the family and friends arrived.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were investigated at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. His former colleagues from the technical abitor and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, were involved in the abitor during his preparation.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ash would spread over the Zapalinamé mountain. He had always told his family and his friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister, announced.
From her point of view, the lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams and she believed that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to join Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not catch it because they thought it would even slip him on a truck. Still, he always tried to make his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio has him as a good man in memory. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and already wanted to welcome the whole family, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán to graduate from his family. That's why he knows that his uncle died when he did what he felt best: fly a plane.
A final departure
The chief of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was elected to all honors under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. His honor was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the school leaders and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985, and he was an outstanding student of both the study and the sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he was flying, in which the State Secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were thrown away.
At 6:05 p.m., Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, met to be handed over on the front seat of the cashiers of the company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other members, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The bodies left were found on a plot at the Cadereyta NL
Some hours before the Fund, military personnel presented the media to eleven persons arrested in the same place in connection with organised crime.
Three men were found killed by shots in different parts of the body and a gardening squad in a abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at 1.5 kilometres from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw that the door of the house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood out.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons within about three meters, which they immediately told the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another who was dressed with a white top.
Almost a meter away was the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information received on the spot, the three persons must have been murdered elsewhere, as no cartridge holes were found.
At the wall of the country house are inscriptions that write an organised criminal band to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretariat de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defence) introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal movement that was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta and who were linked to kidnappings, murder, haloneo (men's hunt) and secret beliefs.
According to public information, eight persons were arrested and a prisoner was released in Los Alveros on 11 November.
Three properties and a phone were secured. The prisoners confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On 12 November, at 6 a.m., soldiers found a PKW without numerals with two seats on their watch in the town of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the car inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, at 2 p.m. on 13 November, one of their accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
You will be appalled by secret additions in the locations General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday's education of the new Italian government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that the crisis that has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse should offer the sparks.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that the crisis that has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse should offer the sparks.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday, to confirm government training.
It is assumed that he will present a majority of technocrats-composed cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will enter his office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on government education.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to complete these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles are overcome.
"The frame is now well hidden," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, has to adopt a strong savings package, which the Europolitics have been required to regain their confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti's debt was further increased by the declining market situation, due to the 10-year Italian government bonds with 7% interest, which correspond to the state that Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government by all forces."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency.
The success chances of Montis were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which had to retreat on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are designed to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Law Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken against a majority of the technocrats-based government that forms Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unaccompanied savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the withdrawal of reforms could again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks exercises with its notice, a defeat Montis is a disaster, as well as pressure.
Monti began his discussions on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The round of sessions shall be closed on Tuesday.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, has launched an extremely rapid government change.
After a short blow at the end of the last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would retire, the uncertainty over the success of the new Prime Minister has again reached critical limits for Italian bonds.
An Italian rescue with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government should last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties are that it should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns in view of the process of printing the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual suspicion and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spain has more games than the ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the Buckel.
Of the pages of Costa Ricas has only one of the 22 called 50 games behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game that takes place today at the San José National Stadium at 15.05 am, players from both countries will be compared.
While world and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a significant number of class A selection games, the three-colour team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the British Premier League have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup Championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie comes with complicated exclusion games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international meetings within the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA ranking list.
We will see how the Spanish team pulls its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who achieved an equality with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (low level 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will record 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a UEFA recognition last week, along with others of the Iberian team that had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle storm of Schalke Raúl González with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Inista with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the sides of the ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower Junior Díaz with 48 games and the tower Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the least games.
Less than 30 games are featured in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national team, there are fewer than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even near the 20th limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had no debut yet.
The historic torhüter of Spain is David Villa with 50 matches, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot nine most doors, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintet referred Costa Rica in his tour to the celebration of its twenty-year existence
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured that a dream would come for them when they were playing in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview last week from Brazil.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they entered the National Stadium at 7.30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You are reading an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy is available in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means to your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time that we are playing in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been to a holiday in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few days.
For us, it's exciting to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely out, and they experience the most intense days before the concert.
What's your favorite fans saying?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years until we got to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and it makes us feel bad to have taken so long until we got here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've been spending in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have a desire to play there.
We love this country, we enjoy surfing and are excited by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent things to surf. In this way, about people who love surfing, we have learned from it.
With a look at the tour, you offered her giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the Costa Rica event?
Since we've never played there, we don't have limits either.
We will try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we have not played anymore into the repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they call us the reasons for the memory why we have liked these songs. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, so also for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
For the first time, I think that none of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band, and that for over 20 years, it seems like a dream.
We also continue to focus on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and are thrilled to produce music.
We're lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the hour of birth?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Again and again a band goes out of a city, but it's unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on her tour. We are glad to be still friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this rising Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has been together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands can last.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be still alive and also to care for each other.
We are all close friends, so we have opened up musical ways that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grow has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We're sure not to be on tour too often, because it's too easy to miss this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as people think they're here because of the music, remember that you have to pay attention to the music and what they've called into life without ignoring it to be a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record to Andrew Woods' death.
We were disappointed to have used it so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or photos, I think what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The Indian band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore the band has chosen to open?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band seemed best for us. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That's definitely exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow LEDs when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that touches him.
Who are you being influenced by as a bassist?
Of so many+
Among the first to come to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the loop in life, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands that I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time, fall in love with me. If they are still important today, I find this great because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, and now she's more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there's a few songs on the new album that could work slightly. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive on themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them. It's very dark songs.
I think if you're older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly make it clear to me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his doctor informed him.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years of imprisonment for violations of human rights during his term of government (1990-2000), has several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, which is operated and controlled four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of the Congress and his personal doctor, told the TV that Fujimori would investigate the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Nursidades Neoplásicas.
Aguinaga commented that he felt that Fujimori could be excused for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish to do so because he considered him innocent.
He was operated four times on zungal cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight. Other diseases such as severe erosion of gastritis, a cyst in the abdominal glands, kidney stones, blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs were reported by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in the National Police Special Operations Directorate since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the Peruvian army's death squad, which was secretly active during his time of government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official presentation by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, starts her visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss the political issues of the region
Mujica meets with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the highlight of his outstanding schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The discussion of the two presidents in Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", the president of the South American country announced on his website.
According to local media, Mujica sought Calderón's support regarding the case with France when French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community, and this declaration was rejected by Uruguay and raised an inquiry with its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and industrial countries. Since January this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been trying to speed up the concreteisation of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "green list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been at business level since 2004 which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The short-duty installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years about the salvation of Princess Peach from the clowns of the evil Bowser, but until now never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which this month comes to the world's store docks, has been cut from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which it can be played without a special three-dimensional glasses.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain when presenting the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game by Nintendo that was developed from the beginning for this console" because so far successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" had already been adapted to existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "expensive" video game that allows a fast, fluid game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" two games in one included: the first part is "light", to capture the less bad users.
Then the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
Furthermore, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without the "optic effects" being sacrificed, three-dimensional must always be played.
This trip to the three-dimensional world of Super Marios also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo knocks on the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The narrow-handed installer must overcome dangerously spoken platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
However, the player breaks on news in the movements, the environment, the clothing and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom provides for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would issue the former Governor Alfonso Portillo so that he would be responsible in the United States for the money laundering of $70 million.
This is the end of the US's application to issue Portillo so that it can be brought before the court.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that, during his government, he did not interfere in judicial decisions and that all the extradition applications from which he was informed took place.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Coloms proceeding is a governmental act, which takes place if all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemala Constitutional Court, Portillo must be delivered when its legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the subjugation of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his time of government. This negotiation was preceded by delivery, but the Minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people who are threatened with social exclusion
The organization has been called into action to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organisation have led to important results: in this quarter-century 6,000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the jobs created for this social group amounted to over one hundred.
On the occasion of the anniversary, the event took place yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people took part.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the city district of Trinidad Vella with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the feast held in Sant Andreu, a number of managers from institutions and institutions who have worked with the association for these 25 years participated.
The participation of political representatives of different directions to election times resulted in the impartiality of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Arthur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and currently left-wing city council Richard Goma.
The main hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Works of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was called into life in very difficult times and that the present times are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the Presidents of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that is white and gives people hope in difficult circumstances.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
The occupied house in which the giant party was held was located
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve houseowners left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything points out that the alpine dreams of the neighbors of House No. 51 have ended on Balmes Street.
Twelve people left yesterday afternoon voluntarily the building they had illegally occupied and organized huge parties in which they had driven the neighborhood to despair. The room was arranged without police intervention.
After the room, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be checked," confirmed the house manager.
The houseowners, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of them lived - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. They also painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially doses of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and the tenants were driven to despair.
Alongside the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her business would have fallen by 80% since the start of the household.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the housekeepers were making their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
Moreover, the owner of the leisure space was shown by the neighbors because of the disturbance of rest, while according to her voice the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the houseowners and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and who, according to the statements of the angry neighbors in the last weeks, became increasingly and longer.
The head of the discotheque explained that the damage was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that she did not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that in the last few weeks they had received more complaints from their neighbors.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartei) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested that the building be immediately cleaned up and the problems of civil life and the disappearance of the city district.
He explained that before summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last months the houseowners had been forced into all floors of the building and almost all apartments. In some, even thefts had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against social activities in the building."
Yesterday another building was cleared by the Catalan police in the Nou Barris district.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached the Montreal No. 35 street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the invitation to tender, apart from the competitions about the honorary.
The city's invitation to open the 16 doors opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona again.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the recently disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its letter about the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in figures with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park again became in the eyes of many people at the upper border of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is among the few that do not spread in the north-south direction, but up (Geberge) and down (the sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, it was now not the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogibar.
As far as the city was concerned, in September, a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, was issued for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a door points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's planning to put doors on the ground.
The question is of itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The invitation is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all the architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring subject that can be addressed by the two members of this old cast, who meet in the elevator.
And that is exactly what this fact offers the substance for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "is it necessary", after the attack on the coast to speak about the "front of the mountain", as long as the discourse of Ildefon Cerda, which was not delivered on the green apples, has not been delivered.
"It should be based on the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because he's very accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for which the title "Tore von Collserola" provides a "lexical case": one must not imagine "as access to a park, but as a restriction of areas to be dealt with."
Modola, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as an "intellectual challenge", the "some dangers" in itself.
Risks due to the "uncertainty that brings the design of a public space today" following the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swinging song" in the forum area.
The first fear is the own restriction on what can be cultivated.
"To limit something always means to set the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [by far on the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster."
Modola, which is closer to the question, means simple, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modola recalls that there is already a study by the patronate de Collserola that should not "spite deaf ears", although he was grateful to the city administration for giving his board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the closeness of the mountain to the city of the guide letter is that it enables architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "suddenly" whether this technical profile is the multidisciplinary teams called into life ("just the right", he says) should lead "We architects should be only a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as there is no global view of Collserola in the terms of the invitation to tender: "There have been 16 competitions on the cross-section," he says, "on the axis of the mountain sea. But there are no long-term perspectives that consider the area as a whole."
This has at least led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would coincide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should without doubt guarantee that the strips are so equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length that there is a soft transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the Casino Red's authorised officer released the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the process leading against him due to undue repression.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released, after being released from prison by the Acting Officer of the Casino Red in front of the District's Second Criminal Court, which leads to the trial against the Mayor's brother of Monterrey because of oppression.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas is to be seen, forcing him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the house.
After the trial, the Public Prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the Panist Mayor's brother, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Antiquo district of the capital, with the official of the Ministry of Publicity 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest order, after the official of the Ministry of the Republic had rejected the crimes for murder and organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison because he had courageously occupied the owners of the Casino Red with half a million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the media security line, since he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as an instigator of the municipal prison of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, received a prison regulation. He found that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence was provided to blame Jonah for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the court in order to open it in opposition.
This Monday, the authorised officer of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to be punished, so he will be set free in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs, in charge of the Court, asked García Gómez whether he had solved the damage and who the owner of the court had forgiven him. However, the lawyer kept the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak. Also, there are no objections to the process, and no compensation is required.
After the hearing of the House's Plenipotentiary at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free.
The Registrar, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been released and that his case would be put to the records.
He also informed him of the correct arrangement for immediate release.
The secretary, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, gives details of the plane crash in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and seven others came to life.
The Secretariat de Communicationos y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons came to life indicate that the helicopter was directly pushed against the ground with his entire unscrupulous structure, without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communication and transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing at 25 meters had contact with trees, while the helicopter lost the rumbling, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 seats, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no anti-circumvention components were found in the studies in the area in which the machine came down.
"No parts of the aircraft were found in other locations during the search, which affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 seats, so he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area shows a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is preferable to obtain the results as soon as possible, however, this may take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Services Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aeroplanes and Relief Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the state Major Presidential flew at the take-off at a speed of travel and the plane fell on a soft hanger.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the landing."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visualisation speed:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visibility flight. This means that the crew had to have sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM listed appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some deeply hanging clouds rose.
Selected sizes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Place of loading:
The landing coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are in agreement. Perhaps it did not give a loss of control over the aircraft before the landing or a deviation from the flight size.
Distribution of the rest of the aircraft in a restricted area:
The information currently available indicates that the helicopter was directly and side-by-side.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was blown to the ground with its unscrupulous structure.
No indication of fire or explosion:
The rest of the aircraft offers at the crash site neither on fire nor on explosion.
The last results of the investigation indicated several ground contacts.
In the on-site investigations, parts of aircraft were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above the sea level. The site is exhausting and shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break.
Some information indicated that the helicopter could have had several ground contact.
After a detailed search in an area beyond the closed area at the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the unscrupulous aircraft structure had been pushed against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to identify the gene for obesity
She conducts a research project at the Mexico Social Insurance Institute to find the gene of obesity in children and adolescents, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Méxicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene of obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in Childhood and Youth", with which genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of Unit de Investigación Médica en Biochemicala (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Specialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers, was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of postgraduate studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports pitches of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday, from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., tests are carried out with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sport site of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of Mexico) and has continued since 8 October at the sports site of Nezahualcoyolt (in the east of the state of Mexico).
If the target of 500 to 600 subjects is achieved, the study will continue at the sports site of Independencia (south of the capital district) and at the end of the study by Morelos (north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify the risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he stated that it would be sought that three thousand children and young people from six to 14 years of age should meet with the agreement and under the supervision of their parents on nutrition issues.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease in order to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney failure.
It further indicated that on the said Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, size), their blood pressure controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (infection of genes related to obesity in the paediatric population) would be determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the health staff's concern over the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of fat-eating boys increased by 77% and the girls with obesity by 47%. Also, overweight has increased dramatically," said the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico differed from that of the other peoples.
He indicated that an (e) Mexican (in) average 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African descent was reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity is forced into the inability to burn out the excess of the energy (calorie) that we have taken, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits for the investigators were contained in a comprehensive survey of the children where they would determine whether they showed a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin defects in the neck and the inner arm (akanthosis), which indicate the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the faeces.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated in writing to the parents by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, which means missing movement every day, most of the time of the day before the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugar drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
UNAM asphalt prevents loopholes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM develop modified asphalt with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
It would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 holes if the rainy season in the Metropolitana del Valle de México (city of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, said that if the installation and maintenance of the asphalt dam are suitable, the number of holes will be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his presentation "Technical eye holes", which he considered to be chemistry on the occasion of the International Year, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but which shows greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behaviour of the roadblock and to avoid the appearance of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heavy part of the oil - is a carbon hydrogen connection, from which some have a high molecular weight - the asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic zelastic behaviour.
The zelastic behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves at high temperatures of almost 180°C as a liquid, at 120°C it is very smooth and at almost 50°C, while at very low temperatures it is broken.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not the same, but one day it changes depending on weather conditions and temperature changes," said the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City were mostly a flexible road block consisting of six layers of materials, of which the last three asphalt contained.
Among the top layers is a layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalt-based and then solidified stones.
Every single stone of this wear layer was built in asphalt.
If the vehicles are moving on and forces are generated, this layer enables a good distribution of forces in the roadblock.
"If it were a modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," the chemical engineer said.
"About the wear layer", he said, "will be a final layer, the so-called wear layer consisting of small stones, i.e. sand, which was also built in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they have to produce friction.
Those who receive and distribute most of the forces of this road block also need a suitable thickness and the material from which it consists must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are still important factors to consider, above all, water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the ground is moistened, water penetrates into the layer and goes back into the layer. This causes a distortion of all layers of the road surface and, consequently, the appearance of impact holes.
If a hole arises," he said, "the cover layer will be removed first, while the wear layer will only be damaged afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that needs to be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programmes."
The member of the System Nacional de Investigados (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load was another important reason for the appearance of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road load should always be relative to the load of the vehicle and it should be ensured that to avoid frequent impact holes, this regulation is respected.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many other research works were still waiting for, for example, asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, with which the impact holes could easily and easily be repaired without the use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14.
Once again Valle del Cauca went out empty at the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner's podium to show a silver crown and the band that she presented as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result of this night's Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department has already taken on 14 mischites and Melina into the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the well-known missions are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at each performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. No doubt she was elected to the Queen of Police and Major Rostro Jolie of Vogue, a title that also had the beautiful queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is crucial to the jury's decision to appoint her as the First Miss is that she did not believe in the answer to the question "What book has influenced you the most and why?" asked her by Martín Murillo Gomez by Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca referred to the Frastoler:
"I read a lot, I think pretty much of the literature, I think it's kind of civilizing, finally I think that the book, which most impressed my childhood, `The Little Prince', is a pretty deep book.
I'm currently reading 'scule and sun'. It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Leidenschaften'.
One answer, which was in little hostility, first because of the term 'civilize' and second because she had not specifically explained how each of her books had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people: Please read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favourite of El Valle is burned.
A journalist from Bogotá pointed out that the fact that she was the favorite of all the events and that she had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Oster, the public vote on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had been jealous of what the Queen was stressing, so she could not shine on stage."
And this was noted in her first performance in the bathroom on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and in her two lifts at the Crown Festival.
Although she was safe on both sides, she lacked the strength and strength that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN, thought that the fact that Melina was crowned as a bride "shows that the candidate, who wins most prizes during the competition, will not eventually become queen".
Valle also went to the end of the press - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle couldn't convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essential part of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason for two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was involved in the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look over the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already cooperated with projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her deer defects and fibrosis, which she observed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body that there was any better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the belly, which was hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from the Cromos magazine of the view, the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body was never her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this price, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the performance in the bathhouse, there was a terrible prediction that should be true at night. It was assumed that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort award so that they would not be allowed to enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting to come from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that you can afford to represent on behalf of the National Beauty Competition in Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming performance for Cartagena, has gone to the throne, will enter the story.
So the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano was
A Lophosophist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
In the last 4 November, a Lophosophist of the State Prosecutor's Unit (CTI) from Cali confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionaryarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Elizazar González had been in the emergency service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigation procedures for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Choco, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he should identify were found.
In 2000, he moved to Valle over and after completing the required courses he specializes in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin, which is exposed to the cracks, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
During the week of the use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eleazar was instructed to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the man who had led the oldest Guerrilla in the world could be. That's why he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the investigator, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, for this was similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was like a farmer dressed in the area, did not wear glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
With a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp, the body’s fingerprints compare to Eleazar’s fingerprints with those on the print sheet.
He saw it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the chief of the FARC.
In Search of Traces
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the award given by President Juan Manuel Santos Elias González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
The Daktyscopy is an accurate science without error rate that can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false evidence or they do not have it.
We take the fingerprints off them and we're looking for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house when he was stealing, because the thief had just stood up in this place with his hand when he pulled out a safe with jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case we were able to take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, killers can also be released or loaded.
Recently, a dead person was found surrounded by vials of snapshots.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be a suspect, and a fingerprint was actually agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it will nevertheless be linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscope of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or band will be used for collection.
Then the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the person's office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without evidence," the experts from the CTI explained.
He didn't mean everything was like it would be shown in the SCI TV series.
Just as not everything is gold that shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if a corresponding comparison is carried out.
The "Emphorts" call out the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked together in tents on the Zucconti square.
A large part of it came to the room command and changed its location into a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement asked the authorities of New York on that Tuesday when they tried again with a proper arrangement to enter the Manhattan Square after they had been cleared from the square in the morning and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed themselves together in front of the Zucconti square, where they had a direct arrangement that allowed the "emports" to enter the new tent in this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement remained in the room command and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests came.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zucotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the answer of the "Emphorts" to the premises of her tentkeeper, who had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent space of the place and approved the tents to the demonstrators.
The "Emphortes" also occupied a new park, which is located at the crossroads of central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which connects, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour. But then the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give any exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efé that among them he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people have been found in this place, where a religious leader has also been approached as a sign of their support for members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zucotti Square (a location in private property) remains closed in anticipation of a direct hearing that is still set up for this service day and the legality of the room in the morning is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who were driven by the place brought photographs of this arrangement and distributed them. They even gave some police officers who were watching the place, which resulted in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had shown, some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The directive prohibits the authorities, members of Occupy Wall Street from being removed from the seat and the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had already used."
Mayor Bloomberg, in front of the press, makes it clear that due to this arrangement, the reopening of the public transport space and the demonstrators were lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the premises of the Zuccotti Square, held by almost 200 people in the morning, which was decided because the demonstrators "resisted against the law."
Bloomberg explained that he would have given the order to clear the place because it had " turned into a place where people didn't come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to add harm to others", because "some business had received threats" and the residents feared "to their quality of life".
"The room in the morning was noble and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of the press".
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they were thinking about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protests have been going on since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary at the TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities she will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the woman of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model at a Canadian TV Christmas broadcast will be the Virgin Mary.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, together with the "croner" (balladensenger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st, will appear in the TV program "It's a Russell Peter's Christmas" and will include a very special young woman Maria's life.
CTV today distributed pictures of the television program, in which Anderson – also for the Internet distribution of a porno himself, in which she appeared together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee – as a young woman Maria with a doll in the shot to represent Jesus.
In the scene Peters, a well-known Canadian comicist of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" broadcast by Charlie Sheen, as a child.
The Christmas program of CTV is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far away from this controversy.
In recent years, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé referred to North American Kim Kardashian as "Hour".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spirals of the free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which is still in the process of being healed after the destructive earthquake that erupted in an atomic crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced since the Second World War.
The government's first estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to $300 000, a blow that seems to slow down despite the difficult economic situation in the world.
After three quarters, the data on the gross domestic product from July to September were intended to finally conclude this chapter: GDP rose by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the annual quota.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The renewal can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the refurbishment of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital plants recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unsustainable growth.
Nevertheless, the actual transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Kenyan attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
In particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, Japan currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The label for the link to the website of the program.
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, after the Yen - the Japanese currency - to one of the "refugee currencies" of the investors fleeing the eurozone's debt crisis and the harsh forecasts for the US, a privilege that, like a tombstone, is placed on the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a tougher currency, the products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, returned their weak business results from July to September to recording the Yen.
While markets continue to occupy the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the constant risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid recovery of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown more clear signs of slowing down economic development in September.
The indicator that presupposes the world economy's turning points made it clear that the biggest economic potential would be the brake.
For he fell about four tenths to the left 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is at 100 after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Can Return Doubts
Papadimos says the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to be confused in the labyrinth, which results from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels is more than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundreds of days that were possible for their implementation were too short, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and, in any case, withdraw his request for new elections to the scheduled date, February 19th.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26th October summit," Papadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will reach its climax tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the law of discipline for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's statement does not express any doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the Transitional Government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organisation that needs the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and he made it clear that he would not be satisfied with a declaration of commitment on the fulfilment of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that it would not be possible to address its demand: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties signed "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika were coming back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million "was 'suffered', although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knee still has for a while feet.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position on this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position worldwide in the role of small-scale financing".
The Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has developed into the second donor worldwide for this resource for international cooperation. Her "beings" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind based on human confidence".
Yesterday the Queen praised the fifth World Summit on Small Credits in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" in order to reach the millenniums of the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the target of the number of people who have to live with incomes of less than a dollar per day, so below the poverty line".
Spain "remains working on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task with great responsibility", observed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions to the summit that will take place until Thursday are guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have noted many successes" and "many challenges are faced."
The Summit on Small Credits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two basic objectives".
The Queen stated that it would be sought that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
The concept of small credit goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the path "initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago" judged by Queen Sofia as an "Act of Justice and Recognition".
The father of this financing instrument described her as a "beautiful idealist who has directed himself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first world summit in Washington and further meetings at the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006. For all, "we have been able to observe a continuous development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project was presented to her yesterday as the "family head" in Valladolid and as the "prior of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by animated the participants to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Command"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical order" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, it was a mistake to link development aid to economic booms, because it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez was of the opinion that small loans were a "stupid and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the industrialized countries should now work "more than ever" on solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall on the victim.
For Spain, small loans are one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, highlighted "the success", "marginalized" people "who are always at the front of closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the inhabitants of a city, which opened "their doors" with the spirit of solidarity.
The CDU proposes that EU Presidents be elected on the basis of a general vote.
The first day of the Congress of Christ’s Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig, died for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
Europe's future was originally not foreseen in the programme, but in the autumn, it continued, in particular, to provide enough for those activists to consider the government policy on Greece today and possibly Italy as a lax tomorrow.
The Presidency's request from the European Commission was almost unanimous.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The ongoing standing ovation, which was first seen by Angela Merkel, and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, was no doubt open from the three European finance ministers.
The main idea of the Chancellor is - as is the application - the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected by a strengthening revision of the Treaty of Lisbon to the budgetary policy of the euro area countries in the control of the European Union; however, this could also be done in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Surely it is only unlikely that the 47 will soon agree on this revolution: Grov-British is facing the thing, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, the delegates in a overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weigh each country in the ECB's budget according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously led to a strengthening of the position of Germany.
The Chancellor, who took note of the climate in his party, has therefore reinforced the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty that would criticise the arrogant Germany immediately.
As far as the European application for the importance of the "German-French friendship" dedicated a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in sickness reports?
According to family support, the UMP and the government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will take place on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux, to visit a family-aid box and to give a talk about the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence from the State, which has been repeatedly repeated since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is intended to put the economy under trial, but on the other hand is not less than a front line of the right presidential campaign, the majority will focus on labour market reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government intends to introduce a fourth morning prior to taking into account a health report for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a disabled worker would lose four days' salary without the approval of the specific company, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A campaign that threatens to provoke anger, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", but would help bring EUR 280 million.
And those with a different symbolic character: to give the public officials an unpaid day of care in the event of illness (there is still no time limit for them, in contrast to the three days of care in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also rejects the subject of fraud again, this time aimed at the abuse of employment.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition these are to be recovered if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13th in front of the RTL transmitter's microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports appear to be a little unproportional.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as of political offensives which have borne the most frequent fruit.
The French are no longer more frequently ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, we will first dwell on the country-wide figures.
According to the CNAM National Hospital Box, more than 237 million Euros were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health, the daily findings in 2008 accounted for 11.3 billion euros in 5% of health expenditure.
Of these, 46% fell as regards maternity leave, as well as accidents at work and 54% as regards sickness leave, which amounted to 6.2 billion euros.
And then 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010 the French were granted an average of 14.5 days in 2009 compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
One average, which confused certain differences: another, in 2007, published by Monster.com, a site for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 respondents, French workers, said not to have taken a single day of illness.
Another study recorded this time by the health insurance revealed that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% over it.
In comparison with their European neighbours, the French workers are therefore no longer prone to incapacity for work.
A long-term study conducted by two French State Research Centre (CNRS) in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global percentage of absences (founded by disease or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sickness reports is a very small proportion of the work of black people.
With regard to the occupation, only a weak ausmav has been achieved.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks in cases of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public college for the training and further training of technicians and engineers) identified 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 of the implemented short-term sickness reports, which were in 37,050 cases "unjustified or too long".
In the case of systematicly controlled cases of disease reporting of more than 45 days, among the 1.2 million, 11% of cases were "uncorrected or unjustified", which is 132,000.
Overall, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have made a report of illness.
A figure representing only a weak scale compared to, for example, that of black work.
According to the UMP Commissioner Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion Euro tax losses per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily compensation, and thus significantly more than the last-mentioned fraud.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to close its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced before Parliament that his government did not have a hundred days to carry out this task.
"In order to continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme for budgetary adjustment," the chief of government explained in his first public speech when the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence was opened on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro-Pacific Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the Euro-zone "is on the line", as he added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos planned to reduce the country's state deficit "to 9%" of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights deny the new savings.
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, gave his consent to the agreed adoptions already approved with regard to an attempt to benefit from the debt crisis, but suggested that his party would not be prepared for an additional withdrawal.
"We will not vote in favour of new elections," he said on the occasion of a meeting of Members of his party, New Democracy.
He had prepared to declare himself ready to reduce budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight waste, but any policy was hostile to those that would impede economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, a trusted EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of more than 8 billion euros without the written guarantee of all parties on their support for the planned acquisitions, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything under the pressure of Aubé.
Euthanasia and accompanied freedom must be legalised, such as an expert board
Canadians live in denial of death, as reported by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on painkillers to provide the best painkillers, and this went beyond cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts involved in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law so as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
As an uptake, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself at the tenth grade, the study notes that "the medical care of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid of cutting the issue of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkilling resources, so tell us the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority desire of Canadians to die at home, however, 68.6% of these people die at the hospital.
In all countries, the rate of deaths in Quebec is the highest with 86% of the deaths in the hospital.
In the very issue of euthanasia and accompanied Switzerland, the authors of the report are opposed to conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already acquired, is not intended to make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied Switzerland.
However, there is no evidence, according to experts who have inspected all those countries alike, whose approach has legalised or decriminalized Euthanasia and associated suicide, that such decriminalization would lead to abuse in their application, that is to say, the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by uncompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases of such violations in countries where Euthanasia and associated Switzerland are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signor of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanying Switzerland is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in charge of euthanasia
We are aware that, according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already rented in favour of Euthanasia, as they believe it allowed people at the end of their way of life to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia does not have the effect of conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
As regards persons who have already practiced a accompanied suicide, the respondents represent 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as maintaining or setting up the funds in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, so the authors of the report.
They also point out in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should specify that the provision of the funds for which a legal refusal has been submitted should not be regarded as criminal.
The Expert Board also calls for the training of health professionals in the task of respecting a postponement of funds at the end of life, which must be feared without criminal persecution.
The board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to pain reduction treatment in order to provide the best pain reduction measures, and this also exceeded cancer.
Last but not least, the Committee calls on the Committee to consider the measures already in place in the Canadian health care institutions to reduce the risk of pain or to reduce the risk of life-threatening diseases, as well as to reduce the risk of euthanasia as little as possible, and to address the same procedures.
Preservation of other experts
Some experts in the area of health have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deshamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts as "extreme" among other things, as they do not set any limits on euthanasia practice in the end-stage.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is pregnant and older than 18 years is asking another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deshamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deshamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to place individual responsibility over all other values involved in the social impact of society.
But, as he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she referred to as "Pro-Euthanasi Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports on the non-absorbing of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and associated Switzerland are legalised, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to join forces
Damascus requires a "complot"
Syria is apparently more isolated
The partisans Baschar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auven Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Baschar al-Assads, which, thanks to Russia's support, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Syrian excluded by the Arab League, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, were in favour of a resignation by President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the former Arab prime minister, President Baschar al-Assad had called for "to lower his power in Syria", where forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
"If Baschar had the interest of his country in the heart, he would have declined, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that since the beginning of the year, Turkish mediation attempts had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot be satisfied with this must go," he explained in a play on Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is becoming increasingly bitter.
The United States, on the other hand, has described the "enhancing of the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime's capabilities" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have hit an ever-increasing tone in the face of repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have died, as announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, were killed by "scoffs and heavy bombings about Jobar" in the sheltered city of Homs.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim was nevertheless the view that the country "taxed at the end of the crisis".
He also reacted with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which represents his assessment of a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not be reported", he added under the criticism that "the plots against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Auvene Trade Minister Alain Juppé also spoke in favour of the dispatch of UN observers in order to protect himself from the regime's repression of the "Paranoia" in his post.
A new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan on the rise in the crisis, particularly the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the occupied cities and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Auvene Minister Sergej Lawrow has cited the Arab League's decision as "incorrect" yesterday in order to protect himself from possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls for the markets to be patient and Italy to be prepared
Mario Monti, a future Italian government leader, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a programme to demand "sacrifice" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a debate with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which consists of relatively strict external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had agreed to give the House a vote of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The talks will take place in the presentation by Mr Monti of a list of ironings, which will be open to doubt from a dozen ministers to the head of state of Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the strained nervousness of stock markets and bond markets called for their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines", in order to prepare a government as well as a government programme, he stressed that it is "sure that the markets will be dwindling and understanding".
His order by the president was confirmed by market entry, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Acting Prime Minister was to establish a staff consisting of mainly technocrats, although he had stressed that "politicals" would also be involved.
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should be given the confidence of Parliament until Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself since taking up his role to work in all the urgency of the objective of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A speaker from EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy has not changed in the light of the new government itself".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome's objective of the budget compensation in 2013 will not be achieved despite the plans taken in recent months, has, in particular, applied for new measures.
Emma Marcegaglia "Chief of the Heads" of Italy, which will meet on Tuesday at Monti, is also in need of economic convergence", as a country that has no growth that cannot respect the deficit figures".
M. Monti, known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "requirement of trust" and another "Italy", as the lead authors.
The gross unknown is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent pre-elections, as from now until April 2012 Italy has to raise 200 billion Euros in state bonds.
Russian scientists help the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wyattslaw Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a nuclear-weapon-use explosive weapon, so on Monday confirmed an American NGO specializing in nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recently published report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA reported its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents since ISIS, the Danielenko, born in 1934, had been working in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by the explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company in Kiev that produces "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was involved in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the IAEA mentioned "strong evidence that Iran's development" of a nuclear explosive system "was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only deeply involved in this technique, but also, as a member of the Agency announced, his entire professional career on this technology had worked directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
From 2009 to 2010, the crimes and crimes directed against Muslims increased by 50%, while other racist or religiously motivated violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, either slightly decreased or only slightly increased.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hass motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases in very weak mavericks, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes growing again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed."The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights law," added Paul Legendre, an organization's responsibility.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these violations," he added, under the estimation, that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards "hass crimes".
The "hass crimes" is in American federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish violent people who are directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and are now also involved in crimes of sexuality.
Twitter changes the platform and likes more and more Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which allows the service to be more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "name" allow better readable live reflections of the activities of other "twitterers", the Internet user whose messages (tweets) you follow and who follow your messages.
This enables them to determine whether they allow them to follow their messages, subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday in August at a low percentage of users, Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its few instinctive functions, with something esotereisch anmutendem Wordlaut (RT for the referenced rehabilitation of someone else's posts). followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiés, so open a wider audience with a more comparable handling of the large public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain "Tweets" over the Internet.
"This is useless, urgent and is very similar to Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" feature will help me to better track certain elements of my flux Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "golden budget rule" into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Austrian government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition decided to incorporate a "golden budget rule" into the Constitution to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation of rating agencies in the Austrian Top Bond (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the public debt of Austria was 74.6%, thus far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not been reduced to AAA's AA+ impact, we had to pay three billion euros in additional interest each year," argued Michael Spindeleger, Vice-Chairman and Christian Democrat Auvene Minister.
Austria also makes a request for the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government at that time would have demanded the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the public balance of accounts in the Constitution or through the adoption of an equivalent law.
The approach taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017, the Federal State's structural budget deficit should not exceed the GDP threshold of 0.35%, whereas the regional countries should have the same budgets as the municipalities.
The objective is to cover the budgetary debts in the 2020/21 horizon below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would intervene again in the currency markets if the Yen should continue to rise.
"If we had an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the Yen ", we will intervene just as we have done the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again speeded up to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced on 31 October to intervene.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar to lower the Japanese currency value, which has been a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
The Yen, however, has increased regularly over this, doubled by the purchases of investors who view the Yen as a "flight value" in these uncertain times of global economic recession and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell on Tuesday under 77 yen, the euro fell below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had affected the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar was recorded around 120 yen, the euro being over 160 yen.
This beam fire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the Archipelago, as it costs the "made in Japan" products and reduces the value of foreign-born income from Japanese companies, as they exchange them in foreign currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11th, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast) for its reconstruction," says M. Noda, who is afraid that the Yen will be able to kill the weak exodus already in the cheme.
The third economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the exploding export gains and the consumption of the household 'lumbified' by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the tenure of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Mr Jun Azumi, Minister of Finance, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all earthly measures to expel the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has noted, however, that BoJ has already initiated "appropriate approaches" and he said that there is no additional currency lockdown on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its public debt purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) which it had spent on various purchases of financial assets in order to cross the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates fast in height, stock exchanges make return
The risk of the debt crisis continues to unterminate the European figures.
Despite the uptake of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also operating this Tuesday, November 15th, a little more in negative fields.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt went back by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Because of the new tensions with regard to the return on government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to issue a part of their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and only aware of the risk of ignition," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Press Agency Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, which, on its part, suffers from the renewed fear of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, has closed with a base of 0.7%.
"Japan has focused its eyes on Europe just like the rest of the world, and trade is moving towards a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the eurozone damages the single currency that continues to be based on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for half a month.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, so it remained 0.4%.
According to the stock exchangers, it went back after the CDU, a party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, had made an application, which in particular provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates of Italy and Spain are still at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning the return of the Italian bonds reached 6.85%, and the Spanish titles reached 6.2%.
These tensions in the interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian government chief Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by debt relief.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the market view, since on Sunday Parliament elections take place in the country.
The interest shares ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year-old bonds have again reached a new historical height.
Expecting growth in the euro area
According to the statistics, France recorded a growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which is slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the basis of the figures of the second quarter, with a negative of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most economic experts worry about.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first increase in the total euro area is expected at 11 a.m., warning the EU Commission of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies in direct Mavé.
It is appropriate to hold a meeting to discuss this issue and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will bear fruit only if it investigates the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not be denied a vital element.
At the same time, the reduction of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate imbalances.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to refuse nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision of necessity, to find a suitable replacement source, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil continue to pursue their projects with determination to name only a few states.
The United States has decided, on their side, to join its park for another unit by re-launching the Three Mile Island project, which was completed after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model is sometimes set as an example, which is geared to renewable energy sources, however, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will result in a deterioration of the electricity price, an increased energy dependence on imports of gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will already become noticeable within less months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to thinking.
On the one hand, Denmark is a European wind-based table driver, with 30% of its electricity; on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, which is used with wind-based energy; therefore, its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and a stability element of the industry at national level, the French companies have an advantage because of the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, which would read the noble statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power to illusion.
Investigations showed that the price that the gross majority of the French are willing to pay was as little as possible, as it would allow them to recognize resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We are now faced with the fact that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industrial branch with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induction jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a host of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them a number of jobs for creators.
If France decided to withdraw from nuclear power, a large share of these SMEs would fall to the ground, and the 6 billion euros of investment and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
What electrician would appoint a six-year-old EPR to operate if the decline of its manufacturer was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be understood that there is just as little of a devil's work as a miracle to produce electricity.
The solutions developed by Areva, CO2 poor solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that conducts uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have become a name because of their professionalism, are directly responsible for the security presentation.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
Only one, and in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions; thus he suffered no consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was challenged by reactor construction as well as by innocuous human failure.
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by a mass that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it had done in the past.
As a result of this process, as well as a cooperation between the safety authorities of French and German nuclear power plants operators and designers, the EPR is a draft that enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a buildingtop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them freeway to travel the leadership position in the unmistakable nuclear power development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy building for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and partners dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is Immigration Last or Chance for the Economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised for a number of reasons - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies because of a number of policies, the compatibility of these policies with the status of a "human rights country", as France itself had ordered.
Recently, the government-oriented abuse of foreign students had marked the weekly sights, the Interior Minister had announced (see Liberia of 23 May) that France "needs no talent, Maureen or Kellner from abroad".
But this policy has only rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
On this subject, there is a broad consensus between the rights and the left.
On the right hand, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had explained in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, could not represent a problem for a country", said Michel Rocard on the left hand, who indicated 1990, that France "could not take up the whole poverty of the world".
The only difference exists in the degree of pregnancy
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by the Hords of Polish Kempner was divided in 2005 by both the right and the left.
From both camps, immigrants were regarded as a burden to the economy and to the French society.
The only difference is the degree of gross negligence that immigrants are willing to face.
Francois Hollande is limited in his programme to banalities that indicate partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work that summarizes the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive impact of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of migration.
Restricting immigration would exacerbate growth and damage the labour market situation.
Fears of the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to replace domestic workers, especially those who are less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
The experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage workers, since they are heavily engaged in jobs that are technically unsatisfied.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that are low in wages, which are more skilled among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthesiists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wage and domestic labour market migration between local and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigration flows results in an inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this is not to take into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is acceptable (highly the proportion of immigrants who are immigrants among American Nobel Prize holders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute directly to social systems, in the European countries, on average, at about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that an immigrant from 30 years of age to Germany will, on average, provide the public budget with a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 over its lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring the missing interfaces "with the teeth" to the entry of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which the immigrants should fear, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, and now it remains to think about European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after their invention in Athens over two thousand years ago, had come across the tragedy of World War I, of totalitarianism, of the Holocaust, of the Gulag, of Francos in Spain, of Salazars in Portugal, and of the commanders in Greece.
Some would have believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible to see democracy obsess over their enemies for all time.
It has been known since Napoleon that it was a characteristic of mental attitude.
The general right to vote, which constitutes the necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient for this and can also be well described as the "pressive instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, education, enlightenment, economic and social community, a legal process.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is also a very, very, very political and democratic crisis.
In this regard, the change of mind of the Greek True-False referendum would have had a double-exclusive character: once the need for a powerful return to politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their inability, their inability.
This ambivalentity should be considered to be overarching.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have retreated today and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim at the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which has been organised depending on the needs and in the order of traffic.
A freelance for the European alone ruler or a jump with connected eyes into the empty of the nationalist retreat: a generous choice for the citizens of the country!
No, we want a hack bean, but a collective task, made out of full law, clarified and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one does not know where to end the census anymore - because there is only one crisis and it reigns in Europe.
It is a whole Europe that submits itself to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each of its member nations.
The urgency is to give public sovereignty the leadership of the European project back to hand.
It is up to the people of Europe to reduce the burden of their debts, to free themselves from the markets and to promote a future through investment.
The rise in the crisis has decisions at European level on a condition that cannot be dealt with without total democratic legitimacy, without sure leading us to ruin.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been fought for a long time, everyone today is pressing for European economic leadership.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it is intended for citizens - would be a new folly and another gas.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make Republicans".
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This training remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically democratic Europe, a truly European peoples' sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chips become the general good
The world fair for chips cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
In 2011, according to Eurosmart, it was expected to end up with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards), with sales of more than 6 billion units.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or compensation of purchases by simply holding the card on a reader.
Compared to the 320 million previously sold this year, 460 million contactless chips must be sold worldwide!
Its market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent more than 10% of the global chip map market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining contact pay on the ground after a long delay in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the initials are modest: only 400,000 contactless visas have been distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
It is now necessary for the banks to provide their customers with these cards to move to a higher speed.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out their customers in the future bank cards that are dealing with contactless chips," Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France, announced.
Banks test payment by phone
However, this is only the first stage on the way to the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone.
A declining percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out these operations.
"They're late."
"But at least next year they should experience real progress."
"We are counting in 2012 on the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Generale had said yesterday to prepare the market for the introduction of an offer that allows their customers to pay without contact by phone.
Terrorist front understands from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The relations between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm.
On Sunday, the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, himself confirmed that Algeria had now "found certainty".
"The way in which both organisations are engaged and the relationships between secret services are reflected in clear cooperation," he explained without going further into detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations on the removal of two French people in Niger last January have promoted interfaces to date.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, were to be killed on the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators wanted to have found several phone chips in the drums at the site of use that belonged to terrorists.
Terrorism
The analysis of the phone calls conducted leads to several interview partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interview partners: a number leads to a Nigerian who has been in Maiduguri for a long time, a city in northern Nigeria that had occupied Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that there is more clear evidence to be expected before you can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's possible."
"I have known for years that the sect has been involved in financial and intellectual support of Auveen and that it is becoming increasingly active," explains Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly apparent in their course, as have Boko Harem's contacts and operating methods, which now indicate the raising of suicide killers and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has been exerting pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have actually considered the group to be a community of Illuminati for a long time, which should not be given particular attention.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means as much as "Western education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic Emirates in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, the merger has achieved rapid success.
It is politicizing and demanding strict respect for the Sharia, while its affiliated activists are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the visionary.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active in their intensified attacks on the Commissariat.
However, the reaction from Abuja is as usual different.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, who was imprisoned in prison, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its castles in the north.
Last Christmas, she was known as an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, so she went to another one in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram will be blamed for a suicide warrant that occurred in the secured police station in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations is the leading international target disc.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania across Nigeria to Somalia, has concerned all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalis operating al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria about Boko Harem and was willing to provide all the information.
The world under the Republican presidential candidates
In the midst of Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq and Israel's relief.
Can a crisis-weak America have a complex world with simple, not to say, leading inflexible ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a number of days, Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-rapporteurs have repeatedly made their statements and their statements regarding Auveen policy, a traditional Republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel's help fall - often underwalled in no way - slogans.
With regard to the designation of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest level in the course, Central Romney threatened to quote the Chinese to the WTO and to address them as the "currency manipulation" - a leading topic in an America - that is driven to the top of Asia by the emigration of all industrial routes.
He said stupidly, if this is supposed to imply the launch of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador in China under Obama and the only candidate who seemed to have a well-defined vision of Auveen politics, almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions making fun of the berry.
He had called for a hand-held but constructive exchange with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman will not be heard as he stagnates in the depths of the polls.
Reagan's plane image
Romney also praised military battles against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I offer Iran content," he said.
"Berd Obama re-elected, they get the bomb."
Moreover, he promised Israel reinforced military aid and claimed Obama to be guilty of this partner's obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second largest candidate, is, on the other hand, wearing a shameful lack of knowledge of the file.
He recently called on the Chinese military threat to counter as Beijing "try to develop a nuclear power" - and it seemed to me that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, insists on being prepared to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama's 2009 refusal to participate in torture against mutative terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
It is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a Auvenpolitic weight.
Against the current presidential opponents, Reagan has also had simple ideas and has nevertheless won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water in his wine, which affected the subject of terrorism.
They are right on the wrong side of his naive bickering with Iran, the early withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
However, this enemy is not so forced.
The population estimates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has disabled Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has protected itself from military intervention that leads to the adoption.
And Obama surprised enough by arguing that America had to be economically rebuilt in order to raise its leadership to a new life.
North Stream, new door to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to do this event with brightness and glory.
Over 500 loaded guests, including four heads of state and government, have spent the last Tuesday at the Baltic Coast under orchestral slamming and at the fine-tasting buffet of the dedication of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his Dutch official Mark Rutte, have symbolically turned the valve's tax, which drives Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is intended to deliver 27,5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gases per year through a first pipeline of 1,224 km long which connects the St Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - will be completed at the end of 2012.
And you can already tap the possibility of building a third line on the same track.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this huge construction works seems like a victory.
The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any transit through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the ground.
For this reason these two countries lose a little of their power: for them it will be more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most strongly engaged in the debate, was not allowed to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of the decommissioning of European energy, as the project has struck a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has almost five years to complete its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries that have strong gas consumption and their gas appearances.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," said François Fillon at the dedication of the gas pipeline, pointing to the extent to which the gross gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All of this explains the broad smile of the gas-prom manager represented in Lubmin with regard to gas supply.
The construction of this gas line is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, in about 200 m deep.
When building it, it had to be avoided from the Second World War.
"Approximately one hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokesperson of the company Nord Stream.
In addition, enhanced measures were to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long hose made of metal, hard like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not broken by anything over the entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was provided for in front of the coast of Sweden, but the project managers took a distance from it, as the Swedish were reluctant to see a Russian state society sit in permanent fashion at the height of its coasts.
"In the case of a Havaria, we close the gas pipeline in less than a minute," Jens Müller specified.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline is thus in the air.
However, this case is considered by the builders to be only unlikely, as the swivel noses were estimated to be a resistance of a leak per 100,000 years.
State surveillance of the gas pipeline is ensured by both a underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes by a seagoing vessel, as well as by a device circulating within the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigarette, has a meter diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of the movement through the direction at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device delivers the most accurate information on any deformation of the metal at its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to be subjected to the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are involved (any to 15.5%), as are the Dutch gas union and the French company group GDF Suez (any to 9%).
These five companies have formed a company which is named Nord Stream and is commissioned with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has thus rented the entire capacity of its gas transport, on a renewable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, no matter how gross the real transporter quantity of gas falls," Jens Müller specified.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount amounted to 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, are committed to reinstate their statements, since Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas line starts at a sandy, pine-like coastal stretch at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gasustrits fort.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other known numbers of the gas in question before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand-notice book.
From an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give up a new style in writing.
It has a flair of adventures, hours added with the letter at Christmas Eve.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular tape, its rubber band, the eggshell-coloured pages, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine Notebook, as we know today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, which has its seat in Milan, decided to bring a distinctive design note on the market at its time.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant of the company, is commissioned with the introduction of the new product.
The note book was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshot), which is called a cotton lacquer, for example, used for the purposes of poles.
This type of notebook was very much asked by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has relived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered to be an icon of avant-garde artist until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand-responsible in Mode Mode.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increase by 26% and are established with a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantom image of the buyers, since the notebook is as exciting to business people as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands how to carry out its identity.
"We are following the Zeitgeist and his new writing requirement, which exists despite the rise of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural feature is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: The brand recently launched an exhibition called "Detour (Overway) " in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Film Festival in Locarno, the company also placed a link with Leoparden pattern on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural contemporary spirit and understood it to diversify his products: pockets, calendars, fillings, computer holes... The brand displays the entire bandwidth of articles.
A success that the Netherlands plans: In autumn 2006, Mode Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, the current Syntegra Capital, and thus launched a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average value: 19% compared to 9% of the total population.
Discouragement?
"No, this is how Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adaptive Association, points out the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"At that time the unemployment rate was not double, but three times so high."
"There's still a lot to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled people before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have an alibi and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in the disabled compared to 38% in the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-engage, and that are the core of the problem, according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which is helpful to businesses.
So much for the actual brakes.
The unprovoked one, the mental attitudes that are certain of itself, but slowly develop.
A study conducted in April by the Association of IMS Entrepreneurs for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers in question have "a low level of knowledge about disabled people", the "overrepresentated" was "by persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disabled".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to reach the employment target of 6% disabled workers, as stated in a 1987 Act.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for making contributions from companies that did not respect this law.
The evidence: The number of "paying fees" has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement is also a real recognition, in particular, of the Grove Group of Companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the jobs between 20 and 49 people with disabilities, companies with 100 to 199 employees, however, employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Before they offered the "Blue Service Days (20:45) the stars, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not spared their pleasure, which brought them the friendship game.
It would have been too far to say that there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic bands.
On the side of the view of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have enjoyed peace.
Five months after the temperamentful gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had earned nothing as a praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look forward," assures the noble Liller on his side.
As for the contrast between his performance at the club and the national team, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"I've been in Lille all year long, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come after Saint-Denis, led on Friday against Romania with regard to the match against France to finally "gloan".
However, without leaving the note of "satisfaction".
The French national team has been on fire since the age of 7 years, leading its victorious troops between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This makes it imperative to strengthen the "unique" character of this meeting even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
"We've just been on our way."
"Instead of being allowed to play it means gross happiness!"
On the other hand, he read "stoll" with kindness.
"The pride, a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbor" - that France "has become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he said excitedly.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the aircraft with the Blues (the French National Elf) ... and in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out rough," he stressed.
"We're planning a thing that players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games." The game against France involved.
Portugal is very reliable
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento sees with great optimism the back play against Bosnia (2:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the case of the two teams, the expertise was lacking.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selectçao" will qualify for the 2012 European Championship, for which he has been responsible since September 2010.
In fact, for Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and to serve a opponent, and that's Bosnia.
In view of the example (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, but the team was not able to express the matter to the important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it is a certain risk, because we have not achieved an external major."
At home, however, in its bright city of de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass through in front of a audience that should be as high on the game, even if the party was declared "very near", the optimistic but clear bento said.
"We expect a very short match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz.
The decision on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a gate.
An inconsequential decision can already suffice the Bosnians who also need a door.
"This is a good result, but it is a certain risk, because we have not achieved an external major," says Bento.
"We are coming against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese had already decided to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "no time to think about it."
A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.
